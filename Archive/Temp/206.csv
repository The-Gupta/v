This study demonstrates that clinically relevant deoxycytidine levels can dramatically protect human T-ALL cells against 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (araG), a promising drug in this leukemia. At 0.4, 1.2, 3.6, and 10.8 microM deoxycytidine, the dose of araG required to kill 50% of MOLT3 T-ALL cells increased 4.23 +/- 1.95-(mean +/- SEM), 23.1 +/- 5.42-, 39.3 +/- 19.3-, and 67.0 +/- 11.5-fold compared to araG without deoxycytidine. Such deoxycytidine concentrations sharply reduced intracellular araG levels and blocked inhibition of DNA synthesis even in the presence of 160 and 640 microM araG. These data offer the first evidence that clinically relevant deoxycytidine levels could profoundly modulate araG toxicity in T-ALL.","['Cohen, J D', 'Strock, D J', 'Teik, J E', 'LaGuardia, E A', 'Katz, T B']","['Cohen JD', 'Strock DJ', 'Teik JE', 'LaGuardia EA', 'Katz TB']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA.

DESIGN: To locate high cost or long stay patients, the analysis was designed on the basis of a mixture of Weibull distributions. In this new model, the proportion of high cost patients was expressed according to the multinomial logistic regression, permitting the determination of high cost factors. SETTING: The 1993 French reference database, constituted in the framework of the national study of DRG costs, conducted by the French Ministry of Health. The database of discharge abstracts recorded in 1993 in the Dijon public teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The analyses were based on 1352 abstracts from the French reference database and 368 from the Dijon database concerning patients, aged 18 and over, suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma. MAIN RESULTS: High cost and long stay factors were the same: number of stays, death, transfer, acute leukaemia, neutropenia, septicaemia, high dose aplastic chemotherapy, central venous catheterisation, parenteral nutrition, protected or laminar airflow room, blood transfusion, and intravenous antibiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account high cost predictive factors, as shown in the case of leukaemia and lymphoma patients, would help to reduce the adverse effects of a prospective payment system.","['Quantin, C', 'Entezam, F', 'Brunet-Lecomte, P', 'Lepage, E', 'Guy, H', 'Dusserre, L']","['Quantin C', 'Entezam F', 'Brunet-Lecomte P', 'Lepage E', 'Guy H', 'Dusserre L']","['Department of Biostatistics, Dijon Teaching Hospital, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hospital Costs', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/*economics', 'Leukemia/*economics/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*economics/therapy', 'Middle Aged']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.53.1.24 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1999 Jan;53(1):24-31. doi: 10.1136/jech.53.1.24.,PMC1756772,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to determine the degree of osteopenia in children with a malignancy at completion of chemotherapy. METHODS: Lumbar spine (L2-L4) bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm2) and femoral neck BMD were measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry in 22 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and in 26 children with other malignancies. Apparent volumetric density was calculated to minimise the effect of bone size on BMD. Results were compared with those of 113 healthy controls and expressed as age and sex standardised mean Z scores. RESULTS: Patients with ALL had significantly reduced lumbar volumetric (-0.77) and femoral areal and volumetric BMDs (-1.02 and -0.98, respectively). In patients with other malignancies, femoral areal and apparent volumetric BMDs were significantly decreased (-0.70 and -0.78, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that children with a malignancy are at risk of developing osteopenia. A follow up of BMD after the completion of chemotherapy should facilitate the identification of patients who might be left with impaired development of peak bone mass, and who require specific interventions to prevent any further decrease in their skeletal mass and to preserve their BMD.","['Arikoski, P', 'Komulainen, J', 'Riikonen, P', 'Jurvelin, J S', 'Voutilainen, R', 'Kroger, H']","['Arikoski P', 'Komulainen J', 'Riikonen P', 'Jurvelin JS', 'Voutilainen R', 'Kroger H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.

METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thickness, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were recorded using standard techniques. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured using specific radioimmunoassays. Serum IGFBPs were also visualised on western ligand blot. IGFBP-3 protease activity was assessed by the extent of fragmentation of recombinant [125I]-IGFBP-3, compared with that induced by pregnancy serum. Anthropometric and radioimmunoassay data were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). RESULTS: The median (range) IGF-I SDS was significantly reduced in all patients (-1.1 (-5.1 to 1.2)) and lower in children who were malnourished (-2.5 (-3.9 to 0.1)). IGFBP-3 SDS was within the normal range for 31 of 38 patients but IGFBP-3 protease activity was raised in all patients. Neither IGFBP-3 concentration nor protease activity was affected by nutritional status. IGF-I correlated with MUAC (r = 0.41) and subscapular skinfold thickness SDS (r = 0.38), but not with weight, height, weight for height, or triceps skinfold thickness. CONCLUSIONS: IGF-I is low in children with malignancies, and even lower in those who are malnourished. IGFBP-3 concentrations were normal in most patients but interpretation is complicated by the presence of raised IGFBP-3 protease activity, which could lead to overestimating concentrations of intact peptide. IGF-I appears to relate to arm anthropometry as an index of nutritional status but not height, weight, or weight for height, as would be expected in normal children.","['Brennan, B M', 'Gill, M', 'Pennells, L', 'Eden, O B', 'Thomas, A G', 'Clayton, P E']","['Brennan BM', 'Gill M', 'Pennells L', 'Eden OB', 'Thomas AG', 'Clayton PE']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Manchester Children's Hospitals, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 protease)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endopeptidases/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*analysis', 'Leukemia/blood/complications', 'Neoplasms/*blood/complications', 'Nutrition Disorders/*blood/etiology', 'Skinfold Thickness', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.80.3.226 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1999 Mar;80(3):226-30. doi: 10.1136/adc.80.3.226.,PMC1717861,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This 10-year study began approximately 5 years ago and will achieve its primary endpoint in October 2004. At the start of the study, 18,882 men, aged over 55 years, and with normal digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of </=3.0 ng/ml were randomized to take finasteride (5 mg/day) or placebo (1 tablet/day). DRE and PSA have been determined yearly (PSA in a central laboratory). When DRE is abnormal or PSA rises to >4.0 ng/ml, a biopsy is recommended. Because of the effect finasteride has on PSA, the PSA value has been indexed to equalize the number of biopsies in both arms. At 7 years all survivors will undergo a sextant biopsy to determine the period prevalence of prostate cancer. The critical assumptions are: (1) finasteride-induced PSA changes result in a simple downward shift; (2) the assessment of adherence is sensitive enough to detect nonadherence affecting PSA level interpretation: (3) factors affecting biopsy loss will be equal in both arms; (4) finasteride does not affect the sensitivity or specificity of DRE on transrectal ultrasound nor the sensitivity of biopsy; (5) bias resulting from transurethral resection of the prostate in benign prostate hyperplasia cases will be negligible.","['Coltman, C A Jr', 'Thompson, I M Jr', 'Feigl, P']","['Coltman CA Jr', 'Thompson IM Jr', 'Feigl P']","['Southwest Oncology Group, San Antonio, Tex. 78245-3217, USA. charles_coltman@msmtp.idde.sacci.org']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Eur Urol,European urology,7512719,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '57GNO57U7G (Finasteride)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Finasteride/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Libido/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",1999/05/15 02:01,2000/08/16 11:00,['1999/05/15 02:01'],"['1999/05/15 02:01 [pubmed]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [medline]', '1999/05/15 02:01 [entrez]']","['19895 [pii]', '10.1159/000019895 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Urol. 1999;35(5-6):544-7. doi: 10.1159/000019895.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of visceral mycoses among the annual total number of pathological autopsy cases increased noticeably from 1.60% in 1969 to a peak of 4.66% in 1990. Among them, the incidences of candidiasis and aspergillosis increased the most. After 1990, however, the frequency of visceral mycoses decreased gradually. Until 1989, the predominant causative agent was Candida, followed in order by Aspergillus and Cryptococcus. Although the rate of candidiasis decreased by degrees from 1990, the rate of aspergillosis increased up to and then surpassed that of candidiasis in 1991. Leukemia was the major disease underlying the visceral mycoses, followed by solid cancers and other blood and hematopoietic system diseases. Severe mycotic infection has increased over the reported 25-year period, from 6.6% of the total visceral mycosis cases in 1969 to 71% in 1994. The reasons for this decrease of candidiasis combined with an increase of aspergillosis or of severe mycotic infection might be that (i) nonsevere (not disseminated) infections were excluded from the case totals, since they have become controllable by antifungal drugs such as fluconazole, but (ii) the available antifungal drugs were not efficacious against severe infections such as pulmonary aspergillosis, and (iii) the number of patients living longer in an immunocompromised state had increased because of developments in chemotherapy and progress in medical care.","['Yamazaki, T', 'Kume, H', 'Murase, S', 'Yamashita, E', 'Arisawa, M']","['Yamazaki T', 'Kume H', 'Murase S', 'Yamashita E', 'Arisawa M']","['Nippon Roche Research Center, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8530, University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kitasato University, Kanagawa 228-8550, Japan. toshikazu.yamazaki@roche.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,,IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/mortality', 'Aspergillosis/epidemiology/mortality', 'Autopsy', 'Candidiasis/epidemiology/mortality', 'Cryptococcosis/epidemiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Viscera', 'Zygomycosis/epidemiology/mortality']",1999/05/15 00:00,1999/05/15 00:01,['1999/05/15 00:00'],"['1999/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JCM.37.6.1732-1738.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1999 Jun;37(6):1732-8. doi: 10.1128/JCM.37.6.1732-1738.1999.,PMC84937,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the explicit mechanism of involvement of this receptor continues to be debated. Employing the murine (S-49) and human (CCRF-CEM) lymphoid cell lines, we demonstrated that this response requires a specialized form of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that resides in the plasma membrane (mGR). Our studies of mGR have been done in our stable mGR-enriched (by sequential cell separation--immunopanning, fluorescent cell sorting, soft agar cloning) S-49 and CCRF-CEM cells. Direct and indirect immunofluorescent studies of live intact cells showed GR-specific periplasma membrane staining. Immunoanalysis by flow cytometry demonstrated abundant mGR in mGR++ cells, but only barely detectable mGR in mGR-- cells. Western blot and autoradiographic analyses of immunoprecipitated membrane extracts from these cells show they contain immunoreactive and competitively labeled high Mr receptor ranging from 94 to 150 kDa. Using mGR++ CCRF-CEM cells and three synchronization procedures (double thymidine, thymidine/colcemid, and colcemid blocks), we have investigated the influence of cell cycle on regulation and function of mGR. Both mGR expression and GC-mediated lymphocytolysis appear highest at late S-G2/M. Analysis of mGR in lymphocytes of several leukemic patients indicated differences in the levels of receptor expression. These findings might provide diagnostic clues about patients' differential response to steroid therapy and potential therapeutic avenues for effective treatment of hormone-responsive leukemic patients.","['Gametchu, B', 'Chen, F', 'Sackey, F', 'Powell, C', 'Watson, C S']","['Gametchu B', 'Chen F', 'Sackey F', 'Powell C', 'Watson CS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA. gametchu@post.its.mcw.edu']",['eng'],['CA49297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Steroids,Steroids,0404536,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/14 00:00,1999/05/14 00:01,['1999/05/14 00:00'],"['1999/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0039-128X(98)00097-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0039-128x(98)00097-x [doi]']",ppublish,Steroids. 1999 Jan-Feb;64(1-2):107-19. doi: 10.1016/s0039-128x(98)00097-x.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have explored the possible value of the analysis of the distribution of CD34+ myeloid and CD34+ lymphoid progenitor cells in follow-up complete remission bone marrow samples from de novo AML patients as a prognostic parameter for predicting relapse. A total of 213 bone marrow samples from 36 AML patients in morphological complete remission, obtained at the end of induction, consolidation, and intensification therapy and every six months thereafter were analyzed. The normal CD34+ myeloid/CD34+ lymphoid ratio ranged between 2.4 and 8.9. In contrast, in most AML cases an abnormally high ratio (> or =10) was observed at the end of induction and consolidation therapy: 96% and 75% of cases, respectively. On the other hand, at the end of intensification, 70% of the patients displayed a normal CD34+ ratio. Patients with a myeloid/lymphoid CD34+ ratio higher than 10 at the end of intensification showed a significantly lower overall survival (median survival of 19 months versus median not reached, P = 0.05), as well as a lower disease-free survival (median of 7 months versus 30 months, P = 0.0001). Regarding sequential studies, 67% of the relapses were preceded by the re-appearance of an abnormal CD34 ratio, whereas relapse was not predicted in four patient with leukemia classified as M3 undergoing maintenance therapy. From the remaining 18 patients who are still in continuous complete remission, all except 3 cases (17%) displayed a normal CD34 myeloid/lymphoid ratio. In summary, the present study shows that the persistence at the end of chemotherapy of an abnormally high (> or =10) ratio between CD34+ myeloid and CD34+ lymphoid progenitors in the bone marrow of AML patients is associated with high risk of relapse and a shorter overall survival.","['Martinez, A', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Vidriales, M B', 'Ciudad, J', 'Caballero, M D', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Moro, M J', 'Calmuntia, M J', 'Ortega, F', 'Orfao, A']","['Martinez A', 'San Miguel JF', 'Vidriales MB', 'Ciudad J', 'Caballero MD', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Moro MJ', 'Calmuntia MJ', 'Ortega F', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/05/14 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/05/14 02:03'],"['1999/05/14 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/05/14 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19990415)38:2<70::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990415)38:2<70::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-s [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Apr 15;38(2):70-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990415)38:2<70::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: TA preincubation inhibited the apoptosis induced by Har obviously or by Cam partly in human leukemia HL-60 cells, and the expression of c-myc gene decreased drastically in the preincubated cells, which might result in the inhibition of apoptosis.","['Meng, F H', 'He, Q Y', 'Zhang, H Q', 'Xue, S B']","['Meng FH', 'He QY', 'Zhang HQ', 'Xue SB']","['Department of Biology, Beijing Normal University, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao,Zhongguo yao li xue bao = Acta pharmacologica Sinica,8100330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '62624-24-2 (harringtonine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Harringtonines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1999/05/14 00:00,1999/05/14 00:01,['1999/05/14 00:00'],"['1999/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao. 1997 Sep;18(5):459-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In March, 1991, Timothy Quill, MD, published a controversial editorial describing the physician-assisted suicide (PAS) of his 45-year-old, female leukemia patient. In a landmark decision in December 1990, the Missouri Supreme Court allowed removal of life support for Nancy Cruzan, a comatose accident victim. Correcting for trends and seasonal fluctuations, the authors examined: (1) U.S. leukemia mortality in the period centered on Quill's editorial, and (2) mortality from accident/coma combinations in the period centered on the Missouri Supreme Court's decision on Cruzan. Female leukemia deaths rose 11.3% above the expected rate (p < .01) just after Quill's article was published. The more closely the decedent matched Quill's patient, the greater the peak, with the largest peak (33.9%) evident for female leukemia patients in their 40s, who were long-term residents of smaller communities (p < .05). Five possible explanations for the findings were assessed, leading to the conclusion that Quill's editorial elicited an increase in mortality. The involvement of physicians in this increase is supported by analysis of the Cruzan case. This showed a mortality peak of 57% for accident/coma patients following the court decision.","['Phillips, D P', 'Christenfeld, N', 'Glynn, L M', 'Steinberg, A']","['Phillips DP', 'Christenfeld N', 'Glynn LM', 'Steinberg A']","['Sociology Department, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0533, USA. dphillip@weber.ucsd.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Suicide Life Threat Behav,Suicide & life-threatening behavior,7608054,,IM,"['Accidents/mortality', 'Adult', 'California/epidemiology', 'Coma/mortality', 'Editorial Policies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Judicial Role', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Suicide, Assisted/*legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Withholding Treatment']",1999/05/14 00:00,1999/05/14 00:01,['1999/05/14 00:00'],"['1999/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Suicide Life Threat Behav. 1999 Spring;29(1):48-57.,,,,,,,"['KIE: 65619', 'NRCBL: 20.8.1']",['KIE'],"['Cruzan v.

Clinical use of 1,25(OH)2D3 has been limited by hypercalcemia elicited by pharmacologically effective doses. We hypothesized that structurally distinct, nonsecosteroidal mimics of 1,25(OH)2D3 might have different activity profiles from vitamin D analogs, and set out to discover such compounds by screening small-molecule libraries. RESULTS: A bis-phenyl derivative was found to activate VDR in a transactivation screening assay. Additional related compounds were synthesized that mimicked various activities of 1,25(OH)2D3, including growth inhibition of cancer cells and keratinocytes, as well as induction of leukemic cell differentiation. In contrast to 1, 25(OH)2D3, these synthetic compounds did not demonstrate appreciable binding to serum vitamin D binding protein, a property that is correlated with fewer calcium effects in vivo. Two mimics tested in mice showed greater induction of a VDR target gene with less elevation of serum calcium than 1,25(OH)2D3. CONCLUSIONS: These novel VDR modulators may have potential as therapeutics for cancer, leukemia and psoriasis with less calcium mobilization side effects than are associated with secosteroidal 1,25(OH)2D3 analogs.","['Boehm, M F', 'Fitzgerald, P', 'Zou, A', 'Elgort, M G', 'Bischoff, E D', 'Mere, L', 'Mais, D E', 'Bissonnette, R P', 'Heyman, R A', 'Nadzan, A M', 'Reichman, M', 'Allegretto, E A']","['Boehm MF', 'Fitzgerald P', 'Zou A', 'Elgort MG', 'Bischoff ED', 'Mere L', 'Mais DE', 'Bissonnette RP', 'Heyman RA', 'Nadzan AM', 'Reichman M', 'Allegretto EA']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 10255 Science Center Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Agonists)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (Phenyl Ethers)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Vitamin D-Binding Protein)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Agonists/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Ketones/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Phenyl Ethers/pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin D-Binding Protein/metabolism']",1999/05/14 00:00,1999/05/14 00:01,['1999/05/14 00:00'],"['1999/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1074-5521(99)80072-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80072-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 1999 May;6(5):265-75. doi: 10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80072-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We quantitated sHLA-I and sHLA-II concentrations in sweat, saliva and tear samples from five normal individuals with known HLA-phenotypes. We also studied sweat samples from an additional 12 normal nonphenotyped subjects, as well as in CSF of 20 subjects with different illnesses, using solid phase enzyme linked immunoassay. Sweat, saliva and tears from normal subjects were found to contain very low or nondetectable amounts of sHLA-I. In contrast, sHLA-II molecules were found in each of these body fluids, although, with considerable variation between individuals. The presence of sHLA-II in saliva was further confirmed by Western-blotting. It was observed that sHLA-II having molecular mass of 43,900 and 18,100 daltons was comparable with that found in serum from normal individuals. In addition, no association of sHLA-II levels with allospecificities in either body fluid or in serum was apparent. The results of CSF sHLA concentrations in different diseases were as follows: (1) High CSF SHLA-I levels were measured during viral encephylitis (n = 3), while none of these patients contained sHLA-II in CSF; (2) The levels of sHLA-II, but not sHLA-I were elevated in CSF of patients during seizure (n = 6) and of patients with neonatal hepatitis (1 of 2) or with connective tissue disease accompanied with viral infection (n = 2); (3) No CSF sHLA-I or sHLA-II could be detected at polyneuropathy (n = 2), or in patients with syphilis (n = 3), or leukemia (n = 2) with evidence of neurologic involvement of central nervous system. Taken together, it may be concluded that the presence of sHLA in several body fluids is physiologically normal. It appears that sHLA-II is the predominant class of HLA molecules present in different body fluids.

In this study, we identified a novel gene human JTB (Jumping Translocation Breakpoint) at 1q21, which fused with the telomeric repeats of acceptor telomeres in a case of JT. hJTB (human JTB) encodes a trans-membrane protein that is highly conserved among divergent eukaryotic species. JT results in a hJTB truncation, which potentially produces an hJTB product devoid of the trans-membrane domain. hJTB is located in a gene-rich region at 1q21, called EDC (Epidermal Differentiation Complex).

Disease genes can thus be identified by viral tagging as common sites of viral integration in BXH2 leukemias. Previous studies showed that a frequent common integration site in BXH2 leukemias is the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene. Unexpectedly, about half of the viral integrations at Nf1 represented a previously undiscovered defective nonecotropic virus, termed MRV. Because other common integration sites in BXH2 leukemias encoding proto-oncogenes contain ecotropic rather than MRV viruses, it has been speculated that MRV viruses may selectively target tumor suppressor genes. To determine if this were the case, 21 MRV-positive BXH2 leukemias were screened for new MRV common integration sites. One new site, Mrvi1 was identified that was disrupted by MRV in two of the leukemias. Ecotropic virus did not disrupt Mrvi1 in 205 ecotropic virus-positive leukemias, suggesting that Mrvi1 is specifically targeted by MRV. Mrvi1 encodes a novel protein with homology to Jaw1, a lymphoid restricted type II membrane protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. MRV integration occurs at the 5' end of the gene between two differentially used promoters. Within hematopoietic cells, Mrvi1 expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and some myeloid leukemias. Like Jaw1, which is down-regulated during lymphoid differentiation, Mrv1 is downregulated during monocytic differentiation of BXH2 leukemias. Taken together, these data suggest that MRV integration at Mrvi1 induces myeloid leukemia by altering the expression of a gene important for myeloid cell growth and/or differentiation. Experiments are in progress to test whether Mrvi1 is a tumor suppressor gene.","['Shaughnessy, J D Jr', 'Largaespada, D A', 'Tian, E', 'Fletcher, C F', 'Cho, B C', 'Vyas, P', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G']","['Shaughnessy JD Jr', 'Largaespada DA', 'Tian E', 'Fletcher CF', 'Cho BC', 'Vyas P', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (IRAG1 protein, human)', '0 (IRAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Lrmp protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mrvi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Defective Viruses', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/*virology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', '*Phosphoproteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Virus Integration']",1999/05/13 02:05,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/05/13 02:05'],"['1999/05/13 02:05 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 02:05 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202419 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Mar 25;18(12):2069-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202419.,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF081249', 'GENBANK/AF081250', 'GENBANK/U63407', 'GENBANK/U63408']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the first analysis published in 1992, a second analysis has been conducted using an enlarged cohort of 124,743 workers, updated dosimetry and personal data for some workers, and a longer follow-up. Overall levels of mortality were found to be less than those expected from national rates; the standardised mortality ratio for all causes was 82, increasing to 89 after adjusting for social class. This 'healthy worker effect' was particularly strong for lung cancer and for some smoking-related non-malignant diseases. Analysis of potential radiation effects involved testing for any trend in mortality risk with external dose, after adjusting for likely confounding factors. For leukaemia, excluding chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), the central estimate of excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was similar to that estimated for the Japanese atomic bomb survivors at low doses (without the incorporation of a dose-rate correction factor); the corresponding 90% confidence limits for this trend were tighter than in the first analysis, ranging from just under four times the risk estimated at low doses from the Japanese atomic bomb survivors to about zero. For the grouping of all malignancies other than leukaemia, the central estimate of the trend in risk with dose was closer to zero than in the first analysis; also, the 90% confidence limits were tighter than before and included zero. Since results for lung cancer and non-malignant smoking-related diseases suggested the possibility of confounding by smoking, an examination was made, as in the first analysis, of all malignancies other than leukaemia and lung cancer. In this instance the central estimate of the ERR per Sv was similar to that from the A-bomb data (without the incorporation of a dose-rate correction factor), with a 90% confidence interval ranging from about four times the A-bomb value to less than zero. For multiple myeloma there was an indication of an increasing trend in risk with external dose (p = 0.06), although the evidence for this trend disappeared after omitting workers monitored for exposure to internal emitters. The second NRRW analysis provides stronger inferences than the first on occupational radiation exposure and cancer mortality; the 90% confidence intervals for the risk per unit dose are tighter than before, and now exclude values which are greater than four times those seen among the Japanese A-bomb survivors, although they are also generally consistent with an observation of no raised risk. Furthermore, there is evidence, of borderline statistical significance, of an increasing risk for leukaemia excluding CLL, and, as with solid cancers, the data are consistent with the A-bomb findings.","['Muirhead, C R', 'Goodill, A A', 'Haylock, R G', 'Vokes, J', 'Little, M P', 'Jackson, D A', ""O'Hagan, J A"", 'Thomas, J M', 'Kendall, G M', 'Silk, T J', 'Bingham, D', 'Berridge, G L']","['Muirhead CR', 'Goodill AA', 'Haylock RG', 'Vokes J', 'Little MP', 'Jackson DA', ""O'Hagan JA"", 'Thomas JM', 'Kendall GM', 'Silk TJ', 'Bingham D', 'Berridge GL']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Didcot, Oxon, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/*mortality', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/19/1/002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 1999 Mar;19(1):3-26. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/19/1/002.,,,['J Radiol Prot. 1999 Mar;19(1):1-2.

Inhibition of the MAPK pathway by use of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor (10 microM PD98059) in both HL60/pCEP4 and HL60/Bcl-2 cells prior to irradiation permitted a similar prolonged radiation-induced activation of JNK1. Furthermore, combined treatment with PD98059 and radiation in both cell types caused a large decrease in growth of cells in suspension culture, a large increase in apoptosis, and a 90% decline in clonogenicity when compared to either treatment alone. Reduced proliferation after combined irradiation and PD98059 treatment in both cell types correlated with reduced Cdc2 activity and arrest in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. These data demonstrate that inhibition of MEK1/2 leading to blockade of the MAPK activation increases the radiation sensitivity of HL60 cells and decreases the ability of these cells to recover from the radiation-induced arrest at the G2/M-phase cell cycle checkpoint. In addition, our data demonstrate that elevated expression of BCL2 does not abrogate the ability of inhibition of MAPK to potentiate radiation-induced cell death in HL60 cells.","['Vrana, J A', 'Grant, S', 'Dent, P']","['Vrana JA', 'Grant S', 'Dent P']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, 23298-0058, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01-CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK52835/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/*radiation effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mitosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'U937 Cells']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 May;151(5):559-69.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chicken beta-globin insulator blocks the effects of regulatory sequences on transcriptional units at differential domains. We prepared a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) containing various combinations of the DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2), 3 (HS3), and 4 (HS4) core elements from the human beta-globin locus control region (LCR), the human beta-globin gene, and the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter driven neomycin-resistant gene (neoR) (rHS432, rHS43, rHS42, rHS32, and rHS2), and also rAAV containing two copies of the 250-bp core sequence of the chicken beta-globin insulator on both sides of the rHS2 (rIns/HS2/2Ins). After isolating neomycin-resistant mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells infected with each rAAV, we analyzed the rAAV genome by Southern blots and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers specific for HS core elements and the human beta-globin gene. All clones contained a single copy of the rAAV genome in the chromosome, however, some of them had a rearranged proviral genome. In five clones with a single unrearranged rAAV genome for each rAAV construct, we assayed the expression of the human b-globin gene relative to the endogenous mouse beta maj-globin gene, using quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. In clones infected with rHS432, the expression level of the human beta-globin gene ranged from 51.6% to 765.6% of that in the mouse beta maj-globin gene. Likewise, in rHS43, the expression level ranged from 36.7% to 259.0%; in rHS42, from 47.8% to 207.0%; in rHS32, from 47.9% to 105.4%; and in rHS2, from 6.1% to 172.1%, indicating a high variability of expression level in clones infected with recombinant virus lacking the insulator. In contrast, in clones infected with rIns/HS2/Ins, the range of expression of the human beta-globin gene ranged from 52.8% to 58.3% of that in the mouse beta maj-globin gene. These results indicate that the insulator functioned dramatically to reduce the variability of transgene expression due to the position effect. This insulator-rAAV vector system holds promise to provide a constant level of transgene expression for gene therapy, regardless of the insertion sites on the chromosome.","['Inoue, T', 'Yamaza, H', 'Sakai, Y', 'Mizuno, S', 'Ohno, M', 'Hamasaki, N', 'Fukumaki, Y']","['Inoue T', 'Yamaza H', 'Sakai Y', 'Mizuno S', 'Ohno M', 'Hamasaki N', 'Fukumaki Y']","['Division of Disease Genes, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,['9004-22-2 (Globins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Thalassemia/therapy', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s100380050133 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hum Genet. 1999;44(3):152-62. doi: 10.1007/s100380050133.,,,,,,,,,,,['J Hum Genet 1999;44(4):273'],,,,,,,,

The long physical history and the indolent nature of these diseases do not support the choice of aggressive treatment. However, regardless of the initial sensitivity of these diseases to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, relapse is inevitable and, therefore, treatment choice especially for younger patients is a serious decision. Intensive therapy followed by transplantation with purged autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells has been shown to be efficient in low-grade lymphomas. However, long-term follow-up study has shown a continuous pattern of relapses, many of which are due to the reinfusion of malignant cells, as well as a risk for the development of myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is an attractive, promising alternative approach that eliminates many of these risks. Treatment of CLL with classical chemotherapeutic agents, as well as biological response modifiers has not provided any significant improvement in the long-term outcome and remission duration.

The main AM studied either by immunohistochemistry on lymph node sections or by flow cytometry in blood and bone marrow specimens are L-selectin, CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD54 (ICAM-1), CD44 (HCAM), CD11c/CD18 (gp150/95), and CD49d/CD29 (VLA-4). Among B-CLD, hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) show a uniform AM expression pattern. Thus, HCL is characterized by high CD54, CD44, VLA-4, CD11c, and CD18 and by low or absent CD11a and L-selectin, whereas FL confined to the lymph nodes is characterized by high CD11a, CD18, and CD54 expression. Diffuse growth and dissemination of FL is associated with alteration in the AM profile. Mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) seems to be characterized by low or absent L-selectin and CD11c and high CD54 expression, especially compared with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). B-CLL is the most heterogeneous among all B-CLD with respect to AM expression. In general, low LFA-1 and CD54, high L-selectin and CD44, and variable CD11c characterize B-CLL. Cases with splenomegaly as their prominent feature bear high CD11a, CD18, CD29, and CD11c on the surface of the leukemic cells. Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) shares the same AM phenotype with B-CLL, with the possible exception of LFA-1, which is strongly expressed on SLL cells. LFA-1 and CD54 are more frequently positive in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) as compared with B-CLL. Splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes differs from B-CLL by its high LFA-1, VLA-4, and CD54 and low L-selectin expression, whereas its high LFA-1 positivity can differentiate it from HCL. Surface and soluble AM have been investigated as possible prognostic markers in these diseases. Conflicting data exist concerning the prognostic significance of surface AM.

The del 13q14 is also found in 70% of mantle-cell lymphomas (MCLs) and in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and multiple myeloma (MM) patients.

Therefore, these agents have emerged as the treatments of choice for all patients with hairy-cell leukemia and have supplanted earlier treatments such as splenectomy and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Since a single 7-day cycle of 2-CdA leads to excellent outcomes and is associated with few toxicities other than culture-negative fever, this agent is particularly attractive and may offer some advantages. However, given the indolent natural history of HCL, long-term follow-up study will be required to determine if one purine analog offers a survival advantage over the other.","['Tallman, M S', 'Peterson, L C', 'Hakimian, D', 'Gillis, S', 'Polliack, A']","['Tallman MS', 'Peterson LC', 'Hakimian D', 'Gillis S', 'Polliack A']","['Department of Medicine, Robert H.

Two cytologic variants have been identified, typical and blastic. Typical cases show a proliferation of small to intermediately sized lymphoid cells with irregular nuclei and scarce cytoplasm. Blastic variants include a spectrum of intermediate to large cells with round or irregular nuclei and finely dispersed chromatin. These cases have a higher proliferative activity and a more aggressive clinical evolution. MCL is genetically characterized by 11q13 translocations and bcl-1 rearrangement. This alteration leads to a constant overexpression of cyclin D1, which plays an important pathogenetic role, probably deregulating cell-cycle control by overcoming the suppressor effect of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and p27Kip1. Detection of cyclin D1 may be used as a highly specific marker of MCL because it is expressed in virtually all of these tumors, but in only a few reported cases of aggressive variants of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and a small percentage of cases of multiple myeloma. Aggressive variants have additional genetic alterations, including inactivation of p53 and p16INK4a tumor-suppressor genes. Clinically, MCL presents in elderly males with advanced disease and frequent extranodal involvement, particularly with involvement of bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and spleen. The clinical evolution is relatively aggressive, with poor response to conventional therapeutic regimens and a median survival duration of 3 to 4 years. Further studies are needed to define better new therapeutic strategies for the management of these patients.","['Campo, E', 'Raffeld, M', 'Jaffe, E S']","['Campo E', 'Raffeld M', 'Jaffe ES']","['Hematopathology Section, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, bcl-1', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1999 Apr;36(2):115-27.,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-CLL patients always have blood and bone marrow (BM) involvement by a CD5+ B lymphocyte. They frequently present with lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly, although in a considerable number of patients, no abnormal physical findings are found. They are prone to develop hypogammaglobulinemia, autoimmune hemolysis, or autoimmune thrombocytopenia. The typical immunophenotype of the malignant cell is CD5+, surface immunoglobulin (slg)+ (weak), CD23+, CD79b-, and FMC7-. Trisomy 12 and 13q deletions are frequent chromosomal abnormalities. The bcl-2 protein is usually overexpressed. SLL patients present with lymphadenopathy, usually generalized. Lymphocytosis is by definition absent and BM involvement, usually nodular, is found in 25% to 50% of patients. The lymph node lymphocytes are CD5+ and have a similar immunophenotype with CLL, but frequently express the LFA-1 adhesion molecule. Patients are at low risk to develop hypogammaglobulinemia, autoimmune hemolysis, or autoimmune thrombocytopenia. LPL/MW patients may present either with an accidental discovery of IgM gammopathy, symptoms related to paraproteinemia, or lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly. The BM is frequently involved and a leukemic picture may be found. A monoclonal gammopathy of IgM class is by definition present in MW and is frequently accompanied by hypogammaglobulinemia. Immunophenotypic studies usually reveal a CD5-, slg+ (moderate), cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (clg)+, FMC7+, and CD38+ cell. A significant proportion of cases carry the translocation t(9;14)(p13;q32) involving the PAX-5 gene. All of these disorders may potentially undergo transformation to large-cell lymphoma or Richter's syndrome.

Resistance to taxol is known to be associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) and a mutation affecting either the alpha- or beta-subunit of tubulin. In this study, we demonstrated that an intracellular cAMP level may also play an important role in resistance to taxol in HL-60, acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Exposure of HL-60 cells to various doses of taxol for 18 hr resulted in cell death. However, pretreatment of the cells with cAMP analogs such as N6:O2-dibutyl cAMP (Db-cAMP), 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) cAMP (CPT-cAMP) and 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) or an intracellular cAMP elevating agent such as forskolin apparently rendered HL-60 cells more resistant to taxol, but not with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), well known differentiating agents. To investigate whether protein kinase A (PKA) activated by an increase in intracellular cAMP level could be involved in increased taxol resistance of the cells, we examined the effects of PKA inhibitors, including H-89 and KT5720, on taxol resistance induced by Db-cAMP. The PKA inhibitors significantly abolished Db-cAMP-induced taxol resistance. These results suggest that cAMP analogs may render tumor cells more resistant to taxol via PKA activation.","['Pae, H O', 'Yoo, J C', 'Jun, C D', 'Paik, S G', 'Choi, B M', 'Baek, K H', 'Kim, J M', 'Chung, H T']","['Pae HO', 'Yoo JC', 'Jun CD', 'Paik SG', 'Choi BM', 'Baek KH', 'Kim JM', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Chonbug, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08923979909052760 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 1999 May;21(2):233-45. doi: 10.3109/08923979909052760.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BoLA region is unlike the MHC of humans and mice in that a large inversion has moved several class II genes, including the TAP/LMP cluster, close to the centromere of bovine chromosome 23. Therefore, close linkage of MHC genes and other genes associated with the MHC in humans and mice does not appear to be required for normal immunological function. In cattle, polymorphism in the class IIa genes influences both the magnitude and the epitope specificity of antigen-specific T-cell responses to foot-and-mouth disease virus peptides. Disease association studies have demonstrated that BoLA alleles affect the subclinical progression of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection. This association is strongly correlated with the presence of specific amino acid motifs within the DRB3 antigen-binding domain. In addition to the practical significance of these findings, the association between BoLA and BLV provides a unique model to study host resistance to retrovirus infection in a non-inbred species. These studies contribute to our understanding of the evolution of the MHC in mammals, to the development of broadly effective vaccines, and to breeding strategies aimed at improving resistance to infectious diseases.","['Lewin, H A', 'Russell, G C', 'Glass, E J']","['Lewin HA', 'Russell GC', 'Glass EJ']","['Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 61801, USA. h-lewin@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*genetics/*physiology']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1999.tb01388.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1999 Feb;167:145-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1999.tb01388.x.,,90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations suggest that T138067 may be clinically useful for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors.","['Shan, B', 'Medina, J C', 'Santha, E', 'Frankmoelle, W P', 'Chou, T C', 'Learned, R M', 'Narbut, M R', 'Stott, D', 'Wu, P', 'Jaen, J C', 'Rosen, T', 'Timmermans, P B', 'Beckmann, H']","['Shan B', 'Medina JC', 'Santha E', 'Frankmoelle WP', 'Chou TC', 'Learned RM', 'Narbut MR', 'Stott D', 'Wu P', 'Jaen JC', 'Rosen T', 'Timmermans PB', 'Beckmann H']","['Tularik Inc., Two Corporate Drive, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'T4NP8G3K6Q (batabulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cysteine/*chemistry', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Sulfonamides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.10.5686 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 May 11;96(10):5686-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.10.5686.,PMC21921,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The membrane-proximal CBD (herein called D2) is separated from the membrane-distal one (called D1) by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain and is followed by three fibronectin type III repeats. We used truncated gp190 mutants and a blocking anti-gp190 monoclonal antibody to study the role of these repeats in low affinity receptor function. Our results showed that the D1Ig region was involved in LIF binding, while D2 appeared to be crucial for the proper folding of D1, suggesting functionally important interactions between the two CBDs in the wild-type protein. In addition, a point mutation in the carboxyl terminus of the Ig region strongly impaired ligand binding. These findings suggest that at least two distinct sites, both located within the D1Ig region, are involved in LIF binding to gp190, and more generally, that ligand binding sites on these receptors may well be located outside the canonical CBDs.","['Taupin, J L', 'Miossec, V', 'Pitard, V', 'Blanchard, F', 'Daburon, S', 'Raher, S', 'Jacques, Y', 'Godard, A', 'Moreau, J F']","['Taupin JL', 'Miossec V', 'Pitard V', 'Blanchard F', 'Daburon S', 'Raher S', 'Jacques Y', 'Godard A', 'Moreau JF']","['CNRS UMR 5540, Universite de Bordeaux II, Batiment 1b, 146 rue Leo-Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux Cedex, France.

TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.","['Yu, K Y', 'Kwon, B', 'Ni, J', 'Zhai, Y', 'Ebner, R', 'Kwon, B S']","['Yu KY', 'Kwon B', 'Ni J', 'Zhai Y', 'Ebner R', 'Kwon BS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine and the Walther Cancer Institute, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI28125/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DE12156/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 14)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 6b)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (TNFRSF14 protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF6B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF14 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Apoptosis', 'Cysteine/analysis', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 14', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 6b', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Simplexvirus', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",1999/05/13 00:00,1999/05/13 00:01,['1999/05/13 00:00'],"['1999/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.20.13733 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73225-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 May 14;274(20):13733-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.20.13733.,,,,,['GENBANK/AF134240'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we found that shifting pHi away from physiological values was unable to induce chromatin condensation or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in the presence of Bcl-2 over-expression.

For one disease, the unit cost may vary from 1 to 2.7 when post-graft complications arise. Furthermore, in the health-care sector, as well as in every other economic sector, costs do not remain stable: they vary in time most especially when treatment protocols evolve.

HIV-1 and HTLV-I share a common host in CD4+ T lymphocytes. However, the result of HIV-1 infection is the decimation of this cell population, whereas a hallmark of HTLV-I infection is the inappropriate proliferation of infected cells. Combined epidemiologic data suggest that HTLV-I infection is enhanced during concurrent HIV-1/HTLV-I infection; however, there are currently no in vitro studies focusing on the effects of drugs of abuse on retrovirus coinfection. We have found that in an in vitro coinfection system (HIV-1 + HTLV-I), morphine treatment further enhanced the levels of HTLV-I p19. In addition, indicators of in vitro infection by cell-free HIV-1 were reduced by morphine treatment in both single and dual in vitro infection experiments. Interleukin 2 levels in the affected cultures were found to increase with combined HTLV-I infection and morphine treatment. These in vitro results indicate the need to further explore the activity of HTLV-I within opiate-treated cells, as this oncoretrovirus appears to be especially sensitive to morphine-induced alterations to its host cell environment.","['Nyland, S B', 'Specter, S', 'Ugen, K E']","['Nyland SB', 'Specter S', 'Ugen KE']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['2T32 DAO7245-07/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA05913/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DA10161/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Morphine/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104454999315349 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1999 Apr;18(4):285-91. doi: 10.1089/104454999315349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine was given at 25 mg/m2 for three daily doses, and mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m2. Cycles were repeated every four weeks for up to maximum response, and for no more than six months. Eight patients had follicular lymphoma, and 11 had CLL/SLL. Objective response was observed in 11 of 12 previously untreated patients, including five complete remissions, and in 10 of 13 previously treated patients, including three complete remissions. Only two relapsed patients failed to respond, whereas two patients were not evaluable. Hence, the overall response rate based on the intention-to-treat analysis was 84 per cent (95 per cent CI: 70-98 per cent). The median survival has not been reached after a 22-month follow-up. Median time to progression was 15 months. One patient on corticosteroids developed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and an elderly patient succumbed to neutropenic sepsis.

Animal models of CML would be useful to study the biology and potential therapies in this disease. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) which will accept human xenografts have been useful in the study of a variety of human malignancies. CML has been difficult to establish in SCID mice possibly due to the lack of a functioning human stroma and relevant cytokines. To facilitate engraftment we injected cells in matrigel which is a soluble extract of basement membranes; is liquid below 22 degrees C and gels at 37 degrees C. CD34+ myeloid blast crisis cells (2 x 10(6)) were mixed in matrigel and injected subcutaneously into 10 SCID mice. All mice developed large tumours which spread to the mouse BM and spleen. However the percentage of human cells in the mouse BM and spleen was variable and ranged from 1 to 50 per cent. In contrast chronic phase (CP) CML cells mixed in matrigel did not form subcutaneous tumours and spread to the BM and spleen was detectable by PCR and not macroscopically. Groups of mice were injected with matrigel containing 1-20 x 10(7) MNC (2-20 x 10(5) CD34+ cells) from five patients with CP CMP. Bcr-abl sequences were detected by RT-PCR in the peripheral blood (PB) of 38/84 (45 per cent) mice at 3-10 weeks following injection of the CML cells but rarely at later time points. In addition, 33/75 (44 per cent) of mice sacrificed between 7 and 35 weeks following injection of CML cells were bcr/abl positive in the bone marrow and 17/70 (24 per cent) were positive in the spleen. Bcr-abl positive human CFU-GM colonies were also cultured from the murine bone marrow of several mice indicating that hematopoietic progenitor cells were able to migrate from the matrigel and engraft in murine hematopoietic organs. Engraftment of CP-CML was more successful in mice given higher numbers of CD34+ cells. Histological examination revealed that myeloid cells grow locally in the matrigel for several weeks, during which time the matrigel is infiltrated by blood vessels which may allow for the migration of CML progenitors to the murine bone marrow. This model system may be useful for studying the role of immunotherapy after allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Hoyle, C F', 'Negrin, R S']","['Hoyle CF', 'Negrin RS']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Collagen', 'Drug Combinations', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Laminin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/*methods', 'Proteoglycans', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*methods']",1999/05/11 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/05/11 02:03'],"['1999/05/11 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/05/11 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1069(199809)16:3<87::AID-HON626>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199809)16:3<87::aid-hon626>3.0.co;2-e [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1998 Sep;16(3):87-100. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199809)16:3<87::aid-hon626>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of normal (M-) mice with anti-IL-12 increased the contribution of IgG1 to the hypergammaglobulinaemia induced by MCMV, consistent with a shift towards a Th2 phenotype. This impaired control of early MCMV replication in the liver, with little effect in the spleen. Control of hepatic infection correlated with a vigorous splenic NK cytotoxic response in a subgroup of IL-12-depleted M- mice that remained healthy, while others became moribund. Mortality in IL-12-depleted MAIDS (M+) mice given MCMV was ultimately greater than in M- controls, but was delayed despite high levels of MCMV in the liver. IL-12 was required for optimal control of MCMV replication in M+ mice. This may involve cytotoxic activity because similar levels of infection were seen in bg/bg M+ mice, where the beige mutation impairs the formation of cytotoxic granules. Hence the ability of M+ mice to tolerate high titres of MCMV during acute infection may enable innate cytotoxic responses to clear MCMV. Interleukin-12 depletion of M- mice also increased salivary gland MCMV titres and depressed delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to MCMV antigen, normally mediated by CD4+ T cells. These changes were not observed in IL-12-depleted M+ mice.","['Peacock, C D', 'Price, P']","['Peacock CD', 'Price P']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Western Australia, Nedlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Female', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Animal/immunology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Interleukin-12/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Muromegalovirus/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1440-1711.1999.00810.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1999 Apr;77(2):131-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1711.1999.00810.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of various monoclonal antibodies to block the degranulation of rat basophil leukaemia (RBL) cells sensitized with IgE antidinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies has been investigated. Sensitized cells were challenged with immune complexes formed using varying concentrations of antigen, and of both high- and low-valency antigen. It is reported here that rat IgG1 antibodies, which are associated in the rat with a Th1-type response, act as highly effective blocking antibodies over a wide concentration range. Rat IgG2a antibodies, which are associated with a Th2-type response, were able only to inhibit degranulation when immune complexes were formed with very low concentrations of high-valency antigen (DNP32-HSA). Under these conditions, some inhibitory activity was seen with high-affinity murine IgA anti-DNP but not with low-affinity rat IgG2b anti-DNP antibody-containing immune complexes. In addition to this inhibitory activity, IgG2a antibodies were shown to be capable of inducing degranulation of cells via unoccupied Fc epsilon RI.

Infection by a number of DNA viruses similarly triggers the reorganization of these structures, suggesting an important role for the NBs in the viral infection process. While expression of the adenovirus E4 ORF3 protein leads to only a moderate redistribution of PML to filamentous structures, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) ICP0 protein and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE1 protein both induce a complete disruption of the NB structure. Recently, we and others have shown that the NB proteins PML and Sp100 are posttranslationally modified by covalent linkage with the ubiquitin-related SUMO-1 protein and that this modification may promote the assembly of these structures. Here we show that the HSV ICP0 and CMV IE1 proteins specifically abrogate the SUMO-1 modification of PML and Sp100, whereas the adenovirus E4 ORF3 protein does not affect this process. The potential of ICP0 and IE1 to alter SUMO-1 modification is directly linked to their capacity to disassemble NBs, thus strengthening the role for SUMO-1 conjugation in maintenance of the structural integrity of the NBs. This observation supports a model in which ICP0 and IE1 disrupt the NBs either by preventing the formation or by degrading of the SUMO-1-modified PML and Sp100 protein species. Finally, we show that the IE1 protein itself is a substrate for SUMO-1 modification, thus representing the first viral protein found to undergo this new type of posttranslational modification.","['Muller, S', 'Dejean, A']","['Muller S', 'Dejean A']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, INSERM U 163, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Matrix/*chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitins/*physiology', '*Viral Proteins']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.6.5137-5143.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jun;73(6):5137-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.6.5137-5143.1999.,PMC112559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we reported that apoptosis precedes necrosis in a fish cell line infected with infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). In the present study, we tested the possibility that nontypical apoptosis is a component of IPNV-induced fish cell death. A variant type of green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was expressed in a fish cell line such that EGFP served as a protein marker for visualizing dynamic apoptotic cell morphological changes and for tracing membrane integrity changes during IPNV infection. Direct morphological changes were visualized by fluorescence microscopy by EGFP in living cells infected with IPNV. The nontypical apoptotic morphological change stage occurred during the pre-late stage (6 to 7 h postinfection). Nontypical apoptotic features, including highly condensed membrane blebbing, occurred during the middle apoptotic stage. At the pre-late apoptotic stage, membrane vesicles quickly formed, blebbed, and were finally pinched off from the cell membrane. At the same time, at this pre-late apoptotic stage, apoptotic cells formed unique small holes in their membranes that ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 micrometer according to examination by scanning electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy. Quantitation of the intra- and extracellular release of EGFP by CHSE-214-EGFP cells after IPNV infection was done by Western blotting and fluorometry. Membrane integrity was quickly lost during the late apoptotic stage (after 8 h postinfection), and morphological change and membrane integrity loss could be prevented and blocked by treatment with apoptosis inhibitors such as cycloheximide, genistein, and EDTA before IPNV infection. Together, these findings show the apoptotic features at the onset of pathology in host cells (early and middle apoptotic stages), followed secondarily by nontypical apoptosis (pre-late apoptotic stage) and then by postapoptotic necrosis (late apoptotic stage), of a fish cell line. Our results demonstrate that nontypical apoptosis is a component of IPNV-induced fish cell death.","['Hong, J R', 'Lin, T L', 'Yang, J Y', 'Hsu, Y L', 'Wu, J L']","['Hong JR', 'Lin TL', 'Yang JY', 'Hsu YL', 'Wu JL']","['Laboratory of Marine Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus/*physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Salmon']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.6.5056-5063.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jun;73(6):5056-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.6.5056-5063.1999.,PMC112550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The envelope transmembrane protein then mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes and penetration into the cytoplasm. Using a genetic selection, we isolated an infectious retrovirus variant containing three changes in the surface protein-histidine 8 to arginine, glutamine 227 to arginine, and aspartate 243 to tyrosine. Single replacement of histidine 8 with arginine (H8R) resulted in almost complete loss of infectivity, even though the mutant envelope proteins were stable and efficiently incorporated into virions. Virions carrying H8R envelope were proficient at binding cells expressing receptor but failed to induce cell-cell fusion of XC cells, indicating that the histidine at position 8 plays an essential role in fusion during penetration of the host cell membrane. Thus, there is at least one domain in SU that is involved in fusion; the fusion functions do not reside exclusively in TM. In contrast, envelope with all three changes induced cell-cell fusion of XC cells and produced virions that were 10,000-fold more infectious than those containing only the H8R substitution, indicating that changes at positions 227 and 243 can suppress a fusion defect caused by loss of histidine 8 function. Moreover, the other two changes acted synergistically, indicating that both compensate for the loss of the same essential function of histidine 8. The ability of these changes to suppress this fusion defect might provide a means for overcoming postbinding defects found in targeted retroviral vectors for use in human gene therapy.","['Zavorotinskaya, T', 'Albritton, L M']","['Zavorotinskaya T', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Tennessee-Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/physiology']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.6.5034-5042.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jun;73(6):5034-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.6.5034-5042.1999.,PMC112548,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These viruses do not contain oncogenes, and the source of their pathogenic activity is not clearly understood. Mechanisms involving proto-oncogene activation subsequent to proviral integration and/or development of recombinant viruses with enhanced replication properties are thought to play an important role in their disease pathogenesis. In addition, the long terminal repeat (LTR) regions of these viruses have been shown to be important determinants for pathogenicity and tissue specificity, by virtue of their ability to interact with various transcription factors. Previously, we have shown that, in the case of Moloney murine leukemia virus, the U3 region of the LTR independently induces transcriptional activation of specific cellular genes through an LTR-generated RNA transcript (S. Y. Choi and D. V. Faller, J. Biol. Chem. 269:19691-19694, 1994; S.-Y. Choi and D. V. Faller, J. Virol. 69:7054-7060, 1995). In this report, we show that the U3 region of exogenous FeLV LTRs can induce transcription from collagenase IV (matrix metalloproteinase 9) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) promoters up to 12-fold. We also show that AP-1 DNA-binding activity and transcriptional activity are strongly induced in cells expressing FeLV LTRs and that LTR-specific RNA transcripts are generated in those cells. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1 and -2) by the LTR is an intermediate step in the FeLV LTR-mediated induction of AP-1 activity. These findings thus suggest that the LTRs of FeLVs can independently activate transcription of specific cellular genes. This LTR-mediated cellular gene transactivation may play an important role in tumorigenesis or preleukemic states and may be a generalizable activity of leukemia-inducing retroviruses.","['Ghosh, S K', 'Faller, D V']","['Ghosh SK', 'Faller DV']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA50459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P60AR20613/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics', 'Collagenases/*genetics', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.6.4931-4940.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jun;73(6):4931-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.6.4931-4940.1999.,PMC112537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A NF-kappaB site in the DEN region partially contributes to the effect of DEN on both lymphomagenicity and virus replication. To further study the effects of DEN and the NF-kappaB site on viral pathogenicity during the preleukemic period, we examined replication of wild-type and mutant viruses with a deletion of the NF-kappaB site or the entire DEN region in the thymus. Thymic lymphocytes which were infected with wild-type and mutant viruses were predominantly the CD3(-) CD4(+) CD8(+) and CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(+) cells. The increase in infection by wild-type virus and both mutant viruses of these two subpopulations during the preleukemic period ranged from 9- to 84-fold, depending upon the time point and virus. The major difference between the wild-type and both mutant viruses was the lower rate and lower level of mutant virus replication in these thymic subpopulations. Significant differences in replication between wild-type and both mutant viruses were seen in the CD3(-) CD4(+) CD8(+) and CD3(-) CD4(-) CD8(-) subpopulations, suggesting that these thymic cell types are important targets for viral transformation.","['Yoshimura, F K', 'Wang, T', 'Cankovic, M']","['Yoshimura FK', 'Wang T', 'Cankovic M']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology and Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA. fyoshi@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA044166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Thymus Gland/*virology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology', '*Virus Replication']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.6.4890-4898.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jun;73(6):4890-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.6.4890-4898.1999.,PMC112532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations were introduced in the tax gene of the ACH functional molecular clone of HTLV-1, and virus produced from the mutant ACH clones was examined for the ability to replicate and immortalize primary human lymphocytes. While virus derived from the clone containing the M47 mutation retained the ability to immortalize T lymphocytes, the M22 mutant lost the ability to immortalize infected cells.

Gag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analyses reveal that HIV Gag production is enhanced at least 20, 000-fold by the 5' SNV LTR in COS, D17, and 293 cells. Furthermore, SNV RU5 in the sense but not the antisense orientation is sufficient to confer Rev/RRE-independent expression onto a cytomegalovirus-gag plasmid. In contrast, the SNV 3' LTR and 3' untranslated sequence between env and the LTR did not support Rev-independent gag expression. Quantitative RNase protection assays indicate that the SNV 5' RNA terminus enhances cytoplasmic accumulation and polysome association of HIV unspliced and spliced transcripts. However, comparison of the absolute amounts of polysomal RNA indicates that polysome association is not sufficient to account for the significant increase in Gag production by the SNV sequences.

By contrast, the frequency of CTLp directed against patient's pretransplant BM remission cells was always undetectable.

The addition of IFN-gamma to the culture significantly inhibited their spontaneous apoptosis without inducing cell proliferation or upregulation of Bcl-2. The NK leukemia cells constitutively secreted IFN-gamma, and the patients' sera contained a high concentration of IFN-gamma, levels that were high enough to prevent NK leukemia cells from apoptosis. Bcl-XL was not involved in the IFN-gamma-induced NK leukemia cell survival.

Transient overexpression of chop in Rauscher cells resulted in a significant increase in Epo- or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced hemoglobinization, further linking chop upregulation to erythroid differentiation. Artificial downregulation of chop in normal murine bone marrow cells with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E)-derived colony growth in a concentration-dependent manner. Burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E)-derived colony growth was not affected. Using a Far Western type of analysis, we detected several potential CHOP binding partners among the nuclear proteins of Rauscher cells. Importantly, the number and relative abundance of these proteins changed with differentiation. The results strongly suggest that CHOP plays a role in erythropoiesis, possibly through interactions with both C/EBP and non-C/EBP family members.","['Coutts, M', 'Cui, K', 'Davis, K L', 'Keutzer, J C', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Coutts M', 'Cui K', 'Davis KL', 'Keutzer JC', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['F32 DK08986/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 DK09201/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 HL08563/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Library', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59567-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3369-78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The JNK/SAPK pathway is activated by various environmental stresses and proinflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines. Upstream activators of HPK1 currently remain elusive, and its precise role in hematopoiesis has yet to be defined. We therefore examined the possible involvement of HPK1 in erythropoietin (Epo) and environmental stress-induced JNK/SAPK activation in the Epo-dependent FD-EPO cells and Epo-responsive SKT6 cells. We found that Epo, but not environmental stresses, induced rapid and transient activation of HPK1, whereas both induced activation of JNK/SAPK. A screen for HPK1 binding proteins identified the hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) as a potential HPK1 interaction partner. We found HPK1 constitutively associated with HS1 and that HS1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cellular stresses as well as Epo stimulation. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides to HPK1 suppressed Epo-dependent cell growth and Epo-induced erythroid differentiation. We therefore conclude that Epo induces activation of both HPK1 and HS1, whereas cellular stresses activate only HS1, and that the HPK1-JNK/SAPK pathway is involved in Epo-induced growth and differentiation signals.","['Nagata, Y', 'Kiefer, F', 'Watanabe, T', 'Todokoro, K']","['Nagata Y', 'Kiefer F', 'Watanabe T', 'Todokoro K']","['Tsukuba Life Science Center, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59565-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3347-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of C/EBPepsilon in the transcriptional activation of various myeloid-specific genes. We found that two C/EBPepsilon isoforms, p32 and p30, possessing transcriptional activation domains were coexpressed in myeloid cells. Interestingly, isoform C/EBPepsilon p30 but not p32 was differentially upregulated in NB-4 promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with retinoids. Both isoforms bound specifically to C/EBP sites in myeloid promoters. The kd for C/EBPepsilon binding to the C/EBP site of the neutrophil elastase promoter was 4.2 nmol/L. In transfection assays using the nonhematopoietic cell line, CV-1, the p32 isoform activated promoters from the myeloid-specific mim-1, neutrophil elastase, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor genes by 2.5-, 1.8-, and 1.6-fold, respectively. The p30 isoform lacked significant transcriptional activity, suggesting that other hematopoietic-specific factors were required for its function. Consistent with this prediction, transfections into the hematopoietic cell line Jurkat showed a 9.0- and 2.5-fold activation of the mim-1 promoter by the p32 and p30 isoforms, respectively. The additional 32 NH2-terminal residues made p32 a significantly more potent transcriptional activator than p30. T lymphoblasts (Jurkat cells) and immature myeloid cells (eg, Kcl22 cells) expressed high levels of the c-myb hematopoietic transcription factor. Cotransfection of c-myb with either the p32 or p30 isoform of C/EBPepsilon in CV-1 cells cooperatively transactivated the mim-1 promoter by 20- and 16-fold, respectively, and the neutrophil elastase promoter by 10-and 7-fold, respectively. Pulldown assays showed that each C/EBPepsilon isoform interacted directly with the DNA binding domain of the c-myb protein. Further studies showed that Kcl22 myeloid cells only contained active C/EBPepsilon, but not C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, or C/EBPdelta. A mutation of the C/EBP site in the neutrophil elastase promoter markedly decreased the transactivation of the promoter in Kcl22 myeloblasts. These results demonstrate a role for C/EBPepsilon in regulating myeloid promoters, such as neutrophil elastase, probably through a direct interaction with c-myb.","['Verbeek, W', 'Gombart, A F', 'Chumakov, A M', 'Muller, C', 'Friedman, A D', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Verbeek W', 'Gombart AF', 'Chumakov AM', 'Muller C', 'Friedman AD', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cebpe protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', '*CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocyte Elastase/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",1999/05/11 00:00,1999/05/11 00:01,['1999/05/11 00:00'],"['1999/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59563-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3327-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed retroviral vectors in which the constitutive viral enhancer in the U3 region of the 3' LTR is replaced by an autoregulatory enhancer of the erythroid-specific GATA-1 transcription factor gene. The replaced enhancer is propagated to the 5' LTR upon integration into the target cell genome. The modified vectors were used to transduce human hematopoietic cell lines, cord blood-derived CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells, and murine bone marrow repopulating stem cells. The expression of appropriate reporter genes (triangle upLNGFR, EGFP) was analyzed in the differentiated progeny of transduced stem cells in vitro, in liquid culture as well as in clonogenic assay, and in vivo, after bone marrow transplantation in lethally irradiated mice. The GATA-1 autoregulatory enhancer effectively restricts the expression of the LTR-driven proviral transcription unit to the erythroblastic progeny of both human progenitors and mouse-repopulating stem cells. Packaging of viral particles, integration into the target genome, and stability of the integrated provirus are not affected by the LTR modification. Enhancer replacement is therefore an effective strategy to target expression of a retroviral transgene to a specific progeny of transduced hematopoietic stem cells.","['Grande, A', 'Piovani, B', 'Aiuti, A', 'Ottolenghi, S', 'Mavilio, F', 'Ferrari, G']","['Grande A', 'Piovani B', 'Aiuti A', 'Ottolenghi S', 'Mavilio F', 'Ferrari G']","['TIGET, Istituto Scientifico H.S.

In the MLL/MEN fusion protein generated by this translocation, most of the coding region of the MEN protein, an RNA polymerase II elongation factor, is fused to the N-terminal third of the MLL protein, a possible transcriptional regulator. However, the molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis by the fusion protein remains unclear. We investigated the effects of the fusion protein on p53 function using luciferase assays. Overexpression of the fusion protein suppressed the transactivation ability of p53. This negative effect of the fusion protein on p53 function was dependent on the region derived from MEN. Moreover, p53 coimmunoprecipitated with MLL/MEN as well as MEN, suggesting that the fusion protein binds to p53 through the MEN region. We found that MEN binding to p53 was mediated by its N-terminal region and repression of p53 transcriptional activity was mediated by its C-terminal region. We also found that these two functional regions were essential for the transformation of Rat1 cells mediated by MEN. Although we could not demonstrate a functional difference between MLL/MEN and MEN in this study, these data suggest that the MLL/MEN chimeric transcriptional regulator may exert its oncogenic activity by inhibiting the function of the p53 tumor-suppressor protein by binding to it.

This quantitative PCR assay utilizes a synthetic internal calibration standard (ICS) that contains priming sequences identical to those found flanking the chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints. Using this ICS-PCR method, the limits of detection were 5 tumor cells at ratios of 1 tumor cell in 10(5) normal cells and a linear range up to 100% tumor cells. This ICS-PCR method has also performed well in terms of precision and accuracy as indicated by low coefficients of variation, minimal random, proportional, and constant errors, and good clinical sensitivity and specificity characteristics.

This approach requires the generation of large quantities of DC that are fully characterized on the immunophenotypical and functional levels.

In GM-CSF cultures, we have identified two populations based on their level of expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules: MHC-IIhi cells, exhibiting the typical morphology and immunophenotype of myeloid DC (CD11c+ 33D1+ DEC-205+ F4/80+), and MHC-IIlo cells, heterogeneous for DC markers (30% CD11c+; 50% 33D1+; DEC-205-; F4/80+). The addition of Flt3-L to GM-CSF induced a twofold increase in MHC-IIhi DC number; besides, the MHC-IIlo cells lost all DC markers. In contrast, after addition of IL-4 to GM-CSF, the two populations displayed a very similar phenotype (CD11c+ 33D1- DEC-205+ F4/80-), differing only in their expression levels of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and showed similar stimulatory activity in mixed leucocyte reaction. We next analysed the migration of these cultured cells after fluorescent labelling.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and melatonin (MLT) modify immune dysfunction and prevent lipid peroxidation. We investigated whether DHEA and MLT could prevent immune dysfunction, excessive lipid peroxidation, and tissue vitamin E loss induced by retrovirus infection. Retrovirus infection inhibited the release of T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, stimulated secretion of Th2 cytokines, increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, and induced vitamin E deficiency. Treatment with DHEA or MLT alone, as well as together, largely prevented the reduction of B- and T-cell proliferation as well as of Th1 cytokine secretion caused by retrovirus infection. Supplementation also suppressed the elevated production of Th2 cytokines stimulated by retrovirus infection. DHEA and MLT simultaneously reduced hepatic lipid peroxidation and prevented vitamin E loss. The use of DHEA plus MLT was more effective in preventing retrovirus-induced immune dysfunction than either DHEA or MLT alone. These results suggest that supplementation with DHEA and MLT may prevent cytokine dysregulation, lipid oxidation and tissue vitamin E loss induced by retrovirus infection. Similarly, hormone supplementation also modified immune function and increased tissue vitamin E levels in uninfected mice.","['Zhang, Z', 'Araghi-Niknam, M', 'Liang, B', 'Inserra, P', 'Ardestani, S K', 'Jiang, S', 'Chow, S', 'Watson, R R']","['Zhang Z', 'Araghi-Niknam M', 'Liang B', 'Inserra P', 'Ardestani SK', 'Jiang S', 'Chow S', 'Watson RR']","['Arizona Prevention Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],['L59794/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/analysis/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Liver/chemistry/metabolism', 'Melatonin/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/drug therapy/immunology/*virology', 'Phospholipids/analysis/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Th1 Cells/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/metabolism', 'Vitamin E/analysis/*metabolism']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['imm628 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.1999.00628.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1999 Feb;96(2):291-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1999.00628.x.,PMC2326749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present report describes a detailed immunocytochemical study of the distribution and localization of human LSP1 in both normal and neoplastic cells and tissues. The specificity of the monoclonal anti-LSP1 reagent was confirmed by expression cloning and transfection studies. The intracellular 60 000 MW LSP1 protein was found to be present in peripheral blood B cells, monocytes and granulocytes but absent in a subpopulation of circulating T cells (10-15% of CD3-positive T cells). The presence of LSP1 protein in medullary thymocytes, but only in scattered cortical thymocytes, provided additional evidence for heterogeneity of expression in T cells. Novel observations also included the presence of LSP1 in plasma cells, dendritic cells and Langerhans' cells. The leucocyte-restricted distribution of LSP1 protein means that it may play an important role in haematopathology. LSP1 protein was detected in a wide range of leukaemias and lymphomas, particularly of B-cell origin, and in tumour cells in classical Hodgkin's disease. Of interest was the indication of a reciprocal relationship in the expression of LSP1 and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) proteins in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. As the anti-LSP1 reagent used in the present study recognizes a formalin-resistant epitope it should be of considerable value in the diagnosis of routinely fixed material.","['Pulford, K', 'Jones, M', 'Banham, A H', 'Haralambieva, E', 'Mason, D Y']","['Pulford K', 'Jones M', 'Banham AH', 'Haralambieva E', 'Mason DY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Cellular Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (lymphocyte-specific protein p50)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/chemistry', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Langerhans Cells/chemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*chemistry', 'Lymphoma/*chemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis', 'Plasma Cells/chemistry', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['imm677 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.1999.00677.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1999 Feb;96(2):262-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1999.00677.x.,PMC2326732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most immature cells in the human thymus express the stem-cell marker CD34 and they respond to cytokines, including stem-cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-7 (IL-7). For the normal progression of T-cell development these two cytokines appear to be vital. We have established and characterized a human pre-T-cell line, PER-487, which mirrors this requirement. This study shows that the simultaneous presence of IL-7 and SCF produces a proliferative response far exceeding additive effects. Furthermore, providing these signals in succession did not achieve the effect observed when they were provided simultaneously. This finding suggests that the effect was not mediated via secretion of molecules or modulation of surface expression.

Following incubation with etoposide, AML cells showed more DNA damage, determined by a DNA unwinding technique, than CLL cells (P = 0.001), whereas there was no difference in cellular etoposide accumulation. Pgp and topo IIbeta levels, determined by Western blot, showed a pronounced variation between patients, but no correlation with induced DNA damage, whereas topo IIalpha protein was undetectable. In the AML group, topo IIbeta expression correlated with pgp expression (rho = 0.7, P = 0.001, n = 24). The topo IIbeta expression was 147.4(+/-74.6)% in the pgp+ AML cells (n = 10), compared to 33.4(+/-27.8)% in pgp- AML cells (n = 14) (P = 0.0001). Our results show a previously unknown coexpression of topo IIbeta and pgp in AML, thereby suggesting that topo IIbeta is a potentially interesting resistance factor in AML.","['Zhou, R', 'Vitols, S', 'Gruber, A', 'Liliemark, J', 'Wang, Y', 'Liliemark, E']","['Zhou R', 'Vitols S', 'Gruber A', 'Liliemark J', 'Wang Y', 'Liliemark E']","['Oncology-Pathology at Radiumhemme, Karolinska Institute and Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. rong.zhou@cck.ki.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 May;105(2):420-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both peptides were measurable in all healthy controls. In contrast, OSM was detectable in 30 (44.8%) MM patients and in only four (16.6%) normal individuals. The serum levels of IL-6, OSM and sIL-6R were significantly higher in MM patients compared with control group (P < 0.001, P < 0.03 and P < 0. 001 respectively). The highest concentrations of these cytokines were found in patients with progressive disease and the lowest in MM patients with stable disease and in healthy persons. LIF was detectable in four (6%), CNTF in 28 (41.8%) and IL-11 in eight (11. 9%) of the patients with MM. In the control group LIF, CNTF and IL-11 were measurable in 8.3%, 33.3% and 8.3% respectively. The serum concentration of these cytokines did not correlate either with clinical stage or with the phase of disease and was similar to those in healthy individuals. We found significant positive correlation between IL-6 levels and OSM (P < 0.001). We also observed positive correlation between beta2-M concentration and serum levels of IL-6 (P < 0.002), sIL-6R (P < 0.02) and OSM (P < 0.04) as well as a positive relationship between CRP and IL-6 (P < 0.001) and OSM (P < 0.002).

Moreover, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA and secreted proteins were demonstrated in all the AML samples. Although all the leukaemic cell lines expressed TIMP-1, the HL-60 cells also expressed TIMP-2. In contrast, normal steady-state bone marrow immature progenitor cells (CD34+ cells) did not express or secrete either MMP-2 or MMP-9, but more mature mononuclear cells from normal bone marrow expressed and secreted MMP-9. Also, normal bone marrow CD34+ cells and mononuclear cells expressed TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA, but these proteins were not detectable by reverse zymography. Furthermore, whereas bone marrow fibroblasts and endothelial cells secreted only latent MMP-2, the activated form of this enzyme was found in media conditioned by cells obtained from long-term cultures of normal and AML bone marrow adherent layers.

The recent development of antibodies against fixative-resistant epitopes and of new antigen retrieval techniques, however, has expanded the possibility of accurately testing routine samples. To assess the relevance of paraffin section phenotyping in lineage determination, 110 examples of acute leukaemia were studied by specific antibodies against CD1a, CD3, CD15, CD20, CD34, CD68, CD79a, TdT, myeloperoxidase, glycophorin A, and factor-VIII-related antigen. The cases included 59 acute myeloid leukaemias, classified according to the FAB cooperative group criteria, 39 precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALLs), seven T-ALLs, and five mixed precursor B-cell/myeloid acute leukaemias. The combination of the markers employed always allowed the identification of the cell lineage (myeloid, lymphoid or mixed) and, in some instances, of phenotypic profiles characteristic of distinct acute leukaemia subtypes. According to the results obtained, bone-marrow biopsy may be regarded as a reliable tool for acute leukaemia diagnosis; this observation is of practical relevance especially for the classification of cases which lack circulating blasts in the peripheral blood or showing dry tap at bone-marrow aspiration.","['Pileri, S A', 'Ascani, S', 'Milani, M', 'Visani, G', 'Piccioli, M', 'Orcioni, G F', 'Poggi, S', 'Sabattini, E', 'Santini, D', 'Falini, B']","['Pileri SA', 'Ascani S', 'Milani M', 'Visani G', 'Piccioli M', 'Orcioni GF', 'Poggi S', 'Sabattini E', 'Santini D', 'Falini B']","[""Service of Pathologic Anatomy and Haematopathology, Institute of Haematology and Clinical Oncology 'L. & A.

Since little is known about the potential differences in AraC metabolism between leukaemic blasts and normal haemopoietic progenitor cells, the formation of all known AraC metabolites was determined in bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), healthy volunteers and specimens of cellsorted CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells. Highly significant differences were found for phosphorylated AraC metabolites (AraCMP, -CDP, -CTP, AraUMP) between AML and normal mononuclear bone marrow (ng/107 cells respectively 1.30 v 2.66; 2.65 v 7.50; 33.68 v 99.0; 1.18 v 5.70). The highest differences were found for formation of AraCDP-choline (3.75 v 12.86) which might be relevant for the high efficacy of high-dose AraC regimens. In contrast, no differences were found in the deamination product AraU (2.01 v 2.91). Only minute amounts of phosphorylated AraU derivatives were detected, providing an explanation for the lacking contribution of AraU to cytosine arabinoside cytotoxicity. Results in normal CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells did not differ significantly from normal bone marrow mononuclear cells and therefore justify their use as a surrogate in determining AraC-induced haematotoxicity. These data suggest a metabolic basis for the relative selectivity of AraC cytotoxicity for AML blasts and provide a means to determine the role of different metabolites and their related mechanism of action for overall AraC cytotoxicity.","['Braess, J', 'Wegendt, C', 'Feuring-Buske, M', 'Riggert, J', 'Kern, W', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Schleyer, E']","['Braess J', 'Wegendt C', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Riggert J', 'Kern W', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schleyer E']","['Medical Clinic III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. jan.braess@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 May;105(2):388-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum TPO levels increased parallel to the increasing platelet counts and reached a maximum level during the first 10-20 d of all-trans RA treatment. The circulating TPO levels then decreased in inverse correlation to the platelet counts. These unique changes in serum TPO levels revealed that TPO levels were not regulated by platelet or megakaryocyte mass in patients with APL during differentiation-inducing therapy, and it would appear that TPO levels are directly regulated by all-trans RA during the first 10-20 d of treatment.

The gene is commonly involved in reciprocal translocations leading to the creation of chimaeric genes encoding novel protein products. An alternative mechanism of MLL gene rearrangement is due to intragenic duplication, leading to partial duplication of the amino-terminal portion of the protein. This occurs in leukaemia, but it has recently been shown that partial duplications of the MLL gene are detectable in peripheral blood and bone marrow of healthy donors and in normal non-haemopoietic tissues. Sequence analysis of the 45 kb of the 5' end of the MLL locus encompassing the breakpoints of these genomic duplications has failed to show a definitive reason as to why this region is such a frequent target of rearrangement. Indeed, although the majority of the breakpoint joins are the result of apparent Alu-mediated homologous recombination, several joins do not involve Alu elements in the region, despite a high density of these repetitive elements in the sequence.","['Wiedemann, L M', 'MacGregor, A', 'Caldas, C']","['Wiedemann LM', 'MacGregor A', 'Caldas C']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London. leanne@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):256-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemias are also frequently characterized by a leukaemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP), either the coexpression of differentiation antigens physiologically restricted to other stages of differentiation (asynchronous LAIP) or cell lineages (aberrant LAIP). We defined LAIP in 241 consecutive unselected B-lineage (n = 193) and T-lineage (n = 48) ALL by three-colour flow cytometry using directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies. The incidence of LAIP was found to be 91.7%. In 63% of patients two to six leukaemia-associated expression patterns were detected. In order to study the specificity of LAIP in a therapy-relevant setting, remission bone marrow samples from patients with B-lineage ALL were analysed for the expression of T-lineage-associated phenotypes on the normal bone marrow cells and vice versa. The frequency of all T-lineage LAIP+ cells and all aberrant B-lineage LAIP+ cells was <1% in regenerating bone marrow samples at different timepoints. The incidence and clinical significance of LAIP+ cells was studied in 196 remission marrows of 70 ALL patients (55 remaining in CCR, 14 with bone marrow relapse, one with isolated CNS relapse). The presence of >1% LAIP+ at two consecutive timepoints predicted 5/8 bone marrow relapses in B-lineage ALL. The occurrence of LAIP+ cells >1% in T-lineage ALL after induction therapy predicted relapse in 7/7 cases. In conclusion, flow cytometric detection of LAIP+ cells appears to be a powerful tool for the prediction of outcome in ALL.","['Griesinger, F', 'Piro-Noack, M', 'Kaib, N', 'Falk, M', 'Renziehausen, A', 'Troff, C', 'Grove, D', 'Schnittger, S', 'Buchner, T', 'Ritter, J', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B']","['Griesinger F', 'Piro-Noack M', 'Kaib N', 'Falk M', 'Renziehausen A', 'Troff C', 'Grove D', 'Schnittger S', 'Buchner T', 'Ritter J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany. fgriesi@med.uni-goettingen.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):241-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By a semi-quantitative competitive RT-PCR approach, we have analysed the relative abundances of RET transcripts in blasts purified from 40 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases, revealing significant amounts of RET transcripts in 60% of AML cases (24/40). RT-PCR data was confirmed by immunocytochemical detection of RET protein in leukaemic blasts. The highest RET mRNA levels, almost exclusively confined to FAB M4/M5 AMLs, directly correlated with the presence on leukaemic cells of adhesion molecules and surface structures typically expressed by blasts of monocytic lineage and were inversely associated with the expression of the stem cell antigen CD34. Consistently, differentiation of the monoblastic cell line U937 resulted in an up-regulated expression of RET proto-oncogene, which was maximal upon exposure to agents inducing a more complete monocytic differentiation. Finally, while transcripts specific for GDNF and GDNFR-alpha were never found in leukaemic blasts, stromal cells of the haemopoietic microenvironment expressed, in the absence of RET, significant amounts of both GDNF and GDNFR-alpha. Our results suggest a role for RET in the functional regulation of AMLs through interactions with GDNF- and GDNFR-alpha-producing stromal cells.","['Gattei, V', 'Degan, M', 'Rossi, F M', 'De Iuliis, A', 'Mazzocco, F T', 'Cesa, E', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Zagonel, V', 'Pinto, A']","['Gattei V', 'Degan M', 'Rossi FM', 'De Iuliis A', 'Mazzocco FT', 'Cesa E', 'Aldinucci D', 'Zagonel V', 'Pinto A']","['Developmental Oncology/Haematology and Leukaemia Unit, Department of Medical Oncology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy. vagattei@ets.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (GDNF protein, human)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', '*Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):225-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two human AML cell lines, OU-AML-3 and OU-AML-7, known to be inducible to time-dependent apoptosis of varying degrees by ATRA, were used. Apoptosis induced by ATRA was shown to be a slow event. It was detected by the DNA electrophoretic method and cytofluorimetrical annexin V assay after 48 h exposure, and by morphology and polyADPribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage after 72 h exposure of AML cells to ATRA. The efflux of mitochondrial cytochrome c to cytosol was notable in Western blotting after 48 h exposure of the cells to ATRA and was observed before the drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential, which only took place after 72 h exposure, when measured by flow cytometry and a JC-1 probe. The apoptotic events in mitochondria were more evident in the OU-AML-3 than the OU-AML-7 cell line. This might relate to the different bcl-2 contents of the cell lines: the basic bcl-2 levels of the OU-AML-7 cell line were almost twofold compared to that of the OU-AML-3 cell line, as analysed by the ELISA method. However, both of the cell lines showed progressive down-regulation of bcl-2, which began after 12-24 h exposure of the cells to ATRA as determined by ELISA, Western blotting and flow cytometry. The present results show that mitochondria have a role in ATRA-induced apoptosis in AML cells and down-regulation of bcl-2 is related to it. In view of the previously published studies, the present results underline the fact that the timing of apoptotic events, such as fragmentation of DNA, externalization of phosphatidylserine, cytochrome c efflux, change in mitochondrial membrane potential and cleavage of PARP, are, to a notable extent, cell type and inducer-dependent.","['Zheng, A', 'Mantymaa, P', 'Saily, M', 'Siitonen, T', 'Savolainen, E R', 'Koistinen, P']","['Zheng A', 'Mantymaa P', 'Saily M', 'Siitonen T', 'Savolainen ER', 'Koistinen P']","['Departments of Internal Medicine; Clinical Chemistry, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, bcl-2/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):215-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe two cases of AML with the t(15;17) associated with a PML/RARalpha rearrangement which lacked typical APL morphology, classified as FAB M1 and M2 respectively. In both cases morphological review revealed small populations of cells which exhibited some features associated with APL. In the case classified as M1, PML immunofluorescence studies revealed the classic microparticulate nuclear staining pattern as observed in typical cases of APL with the t(15;17). Similarly, blasts from this case were found to be sensitive to ATRA in vitro as determined by NBT reduction test and by normalization of the PML nuclear body staining pattern. To determine the frequency of PML/RARalpha rearrangements in FAB subtypes other than M3, 530 patients from the MRC AML trials were screened using nested RT-PCR. Only one individual, initially classified as M5 with a normal karyotype, was found to have a PML/RARalpha rearrangement. The diagnosis was revised to M3 variant on subsequent morphological review. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, in rare cases, the t(15;17) is not restricted to patients with M3 morphology as defined by current FAB criteria. Therefore, although we consider cytogenetic analysis of newly diagnosed cases of AML to be mandatory, our data suggests that routine molecular screening for PML/RARalpha rearrangements is not justified and should be reserved for those cases displaying features which may be suspicious of APL even if such cells comprise only a minority of the total population.","['Allford, S', 'Grimwade, D', 'Langabeer, S', 'Duprez, E', 'Saurin, A', 'Chatters, S', 'Walker, H', 'Roberts, P', 'Rogers, J', 'Bain, B', 'Patterson, K', 'McKernan, A', 'Freemont, P', 'Solomon, E', 'Burnett, A', 'Goldstone, A', 'Linch, D']","['Allford S', 'Grimwade D', 'Langabeer S', 'Duprez E', 'Saurin A', 'Chatters S', 'Walker H', 'Roberts P', 'Rogers J', 'Bain B', 'Patterson K', 'McKernan A', 'Freemont P', 'Solomon E', 'Burnett A', 'Goldstone A', 'Linch D']","['Departments of HaematologyUniversity College London Hospitals and Medical School, London.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):198-207.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study lymphocytes from normal subjects and patients with B-CLL were allowed to undergo transendothelial migration across confluent layers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Lymphocytes in B-CLL samples showed an impaired capacity to migrate while the minor proportion of normal T cells was enriched by a mean of 2.5-fold in the transmigrated lymphocytes. In contrast, the ratio of B to T lymphocytes in normal preparations was unchanged in the transmigrated population. The expression of adhesion molecules on B-CLL lymphocytes before and after transendothelial migration was studied by flow cytometry which showed that 71 +/- 5% of L-selectin was lost from the surface of transmigrated lymphocytes. T and B cells from normal subjects also showed a major loss of L-selectin after transmigration. B-CLL lymphocytes and normal B cells expressed CD23 but this molecule was down-regulated following transendothelial migration, whereas the expression of VLA-4, ICAM-1, LFA-1 and CD44 was unchanged. Lymphocytes incubated with oxidized ATP, an irreversible inhibitor of P2Z/P2X7 purinoceptors, retained their capacity for transendothelial migration and showed the same loss of L-selectin as control leukaemic lymphocytes.

Moreover, transendothelial migration involves a universal loss of L-selectin and CD23 from lymphocytes which suggests that the high serum levels of soluble L-selectin and CD23 observed in B-CLL may be generated by shedding during the process of transendothelial migration.","['Chen, J R', 'Gu, B J', 'Dao, L P', 'Bradley, C J', 'Mulligan, S P', 'Wiley, J S']","['Chen JR', 'Gu BJ', 'Dao LP', 'Bradley CJ', 'Mulligan SP', 'Wiley JS']","['Sydney University Department of Medicine, Nepean Hospital, Penrith, N.S.W., Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Cell Movement/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):181-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-alpha has also been found to indirectly up-regulate the expression of major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, and to directly increase the activity of lymphocytes against tumour cells. To elucidate whether IFN-alpha induces anti-leukaemic activity of the autologous T cells in CML patients, we analysed the accumulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) in each Vbeta family using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by single-strand conformation (SSCP) analysis. We found the predominant expression of the Vbeta 10, 12, and 14 families in the peripheral blood (PB) of CML patients, in contrast to healthy donors. Especially, in IFN-alpha-responsive patients, we observed an enhancement of the accumulation of the Vbeta 9 and 20 families, suggesting that T cells enhanced by IFN-alpha may react with a discrete set of antigens on the surface of malignant cells. These findings may demonstrate that CML cells possess the heterogenous antigens and the clonal expansion of Vbeta 9+ and Vbeta 20+ T cells may be a prognostic indicator of the immune responsiveness to IFN-alpha.","['Shimomura, T', 'Fujii, S', 'Ezaki, I', 'Osato, M', 'Fujimoto, K', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Kawakita, M']","['Shimomura T', 'Fujii S', 'Ezaki I', 'Osato M', 'Fujimoto K', 'Takatsuki K', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kawakita M']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):173-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide evidence that along the granulocytic maturation in normal marrow, the acquisition of LAP surface expression, identified by the monoclonal antibody 1B12.1, was restricted to CD11bbright/CD16bright positive cells. Moreover, in normal granulocytes, exposure to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in vitro and in vivo increased the cell surface expression of LAP. Although G-CSF was able to induce the LAP surface expression in CML granulocytes, the inhibition of p210 tyrosine kinase activity by genistein or CGP75148B failed to restore LAP mRNA expression and LAP protein synthesis. In conclusion, the acquisition of LAP protein on the cell surface of granulocytes follows CD16 antigen expression and can be considered as the last marker of terminally differentiated neutrophils. G-CSF is a potent regulator of the LAP mRNA expression and protein synthesis in normal and CML-derived neutrophils. The lack of direct activity of p210 tyrosine kinase on LAP mRNA expression in CML neutrophils supports the notion that the LAP defect in this disease could be related to a precocious and uncontrolled release of white blood cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream.","['Dotti, G', 'Garattini, E', 'Borleri, G', 'Masuhara, K', 'Spinelli, O', 'Barbui, T', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Dotti G', 'Garattini E', 'Borleri G', 'Masuhara K', 'Spinelli O', 'Barbui T', 'Rambaldi A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):163-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By RT-PCR, expression of FLT3 was detected in 45/74 (61%) leukaemia cell lines and the frequency of expression of FLT3 was significantly higher in undifferentiated type (B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; ALL) than in differentiated type cell lines (B-ALL) (P = 0.0076). Using the genomic PCR method, 194 fresh samples including 87 acute myeloid leukaemias, 60 ALLs, 32 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and 15 juvenile chronic myelogenous leukaemias (JCMLs) were examined. Tandem duplication was found in 12 (13.8%) AMLs and two (3.3%) ALLs. Sequence analyses of the 14 samples with the duplication revealed that eight showed a simple tandem duplication and six a tandem duplication with insertion. Most of these tandem duplications occurred within exon 11, and two duplications occurred from exon 11 to intron 11 and exon 12. No tandem duplications of FLT3 gene were detected in MDS or JCML. The frequency of tandem duplication of FLT3 gene in childhood AML was lower than that in adult AML so far reported. All of the 12 AML patients with the duplication died within 47 months after diagnosis, whereas two ALL patients with the duplication have survived 44 and 72 months, respectively. These two ALL patients expressed both lymphoid and myeloid antigens and were considered to have biphenotypic leukaemia. These results suggest that tandem duplication is involved in ALL in addition to AML, but not in childhood MDS or JCML, and that childhood AML patients with the tandem duplication have a poor prognosis.","['Xu, F', 'Taki, T', 'Yang, H W', 'Hanada, R', 'Hongo, T', 'Ohnishi, H', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Bessho, F', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Hayashi, Y']","['Xu F', 'Taki T', 'Yang HW', 'Hanada R', 'Hongo T', 'Ohnishi H', 'Kobayashi M', 'Bessho F', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):155-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, expression of these signalling components in the process of differentiation of haemopoietic cells was investigated. Ret was expressed at variable levels in normal and malignant cells of the myelomonocyte lineage. Immunohistochemical analysis of human and mouse tissues revealed that Ret expression was increased in intermediate mature myeloid cells such as promyelocytes and myelocytes and decreased in mature granulocytes and monocytes. Consistent with this observation, when THP-1 monocytic and HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells expressing Ret were differentiated toward macrophages or granulocytes by treatment of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or all-trans retinoic acid (RA), Ret expression strikingly decreased during differentiation. Expression of GDNF, NTN, GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 was undetectable in THP-1 and HL-60 cells as well as in bone marrow haemopoietic cells. In contrast, bone marrow stromal cells appeared to express GDNF, GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 but not Ret. These findings suggested that the interaction between stromal cells and Ret-expressing haemopoietic cells in the bone marrow microenvironment may play a role in the differentiation of myelomonocyte-lineage cells through activation of the GDNF/Ret signalling pathway.","['Nakayama, S', 'Iida, K', 'Tsuzuki, T', 'Iwashita, T', 'Murakami, H', 'Asai, N', 'Iwata, Y', 'Ichihara, M', 'Ito, S', 'Kawai, K', 'Asai, M', 'Kurokawa, K', 'Takahashi, M']","['Nakayama S', 'Iida K', 'Tsuzuki T', 'Iwashita T', 'Murakami H', 'Asai N', 'Iwata Y', 'Ichihara M', 'Ito S', 'Kawai K', 'Asai M', 'Kurokawa K', 'Takahashi M']","['Department of Pathology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Apr;105(1):50-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A well-studied receptor that responds to aggregation is the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI), which is responsible for initiating allergic reactions. To quantify antigen-induced aggregation of IgE-FcepsilonRI complexes, we have developed a method based on multiparameter flow cytometry to monitor both occupancy of surface IgE combining sites and association of antigen with the cell surface. The number of bound IgE combining sites in excess of the number of bound antigens, the number of bridges between receptors, provides a quantitative measure of IgE-FcepsilonRI aggregation. We demonstrate our method by using it to study the equilibrium binding of a haptenated fluorescent protein, 2,4-dinitrophenol-coupled B-phycoerythrin (DNP25-PE), to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-DNP IgE on the surface of rat basophilic leukemia cells. The results, which we analyze with the aid of a mathematical model, indicate how IgE-FcepsilonRI aggregation depends on the total concentrations of DNP25-PE and surface IgE. As expected, we find that maximal aggregation occurs at an optimal antigen concentration. We also find that aggregation varies qualitatively with the total concentration of surface IgE as predicted by an earlier theoretical analysis.","['Hlavacek, W S', 'Perelson, A S', 'Sulzer, B', 'Bold, J', 'Paar, J', 'Gorman, W', 'Posner, R G']","['Hlavacek WS', 'Perelson AS', 'Sulzer B', 'Bold J', 'Paar J', 'Gorman W', 'Posner RG']","['Theoretical Biology and Biophysics, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI28433/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI35997/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR06555/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '11016-17-4 (Phycoerythrin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'Q13SKS21MN (2,4-Dinitrophenol)']",IM,"['2,4-Dinitrophenol/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Immunoglobulin E/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phycoerythrin/immunology', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(99)77397-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-3495(99)77397-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1999 May;76(5):2421-31. doi: 10.1016/s0006-3495(99)77397-2.,PMC1300214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median Day to platelets >20,000/microL was 50 for BM and 25 for PSCs, and to platelets >50,000/microL was 138 for BM and 34 for PSCs (p not significant). After the first three patients received IL-2 at 2 mIU x m(-2) x day(-1) and had slow reconstitution, four patients were treated without IL-2 until the maintenance phase following reconstitution. The remaining 29 patients received the initial ""post-infusion"" IL-2 at 1 mIU x m(-2) x day(-1). Toxicities associated with the infusion of IL-2-activated cells consisted of chills and fever in about one-half of the patients and transient hypotension in 12%. Low-dose IL-2 by continuous i.v. infusion in the early posttransplant period was associated with exacerbation of fever, diarrhea, and altered mental status in a minority of patients. The major dose-limiting toxicities of maintenance IL-2 were fever, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash, and dyspnea. Among 24 lymphoma patients, nine are in continuous complete remission (CCR) from 18-48 months, and 15 have died (12 due to relapse and three of therapy-related toxicities). Of 12 acute leukemia patients, two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are in CCR at 38 and 43 months, and one patient who was in cytogenetic but not molecular remission of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL died of progressive leukemia at Day 108. Three of nine with myeloid leukemia are in CCR at 21, 46, and 53 months; one is in hematologic and cytogenetic remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia at 55 months with multiple new cytogenetic abnormalities; one is alive at 54 months with pancytopenia after incomplete hematologic recovery followed by multiple new cytogenetic abnormalities (myelodysplasia); and one had an unrelated donor transplant after relapsing 4 months following protocol therapy. One myeloid leukemia patient remains without evidence of relapse, but is transfusion-dependent at 15 months following transplant.","['Margolin, K A', 'Van Besien, K', 'Wright, C', 'Niland, J', 'Champlin, R', 'Fung, H C', 'Kashyap, A', 'Molina, A', 'Nademanee, A P', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Parker, P', 'Smith, E', 'Spielberger, R', 'Somlo, G', 'Snyder, D', 'Stein, A', 'Woo, D', 'Thomas, M', 'Sniecinski, I', 'Forman, S J']","['Margolin KA', 'Van Besien K', 'Wright C', 'Niland J', 'Champlin R', 'Fung HC', 'Kashyap A', 'Molina A', 'Nademanee AP', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Parker P', 'Smith E', 'Spielberger R', 'Somlo G', 'Snyder D', 'Stein A', 'Woo D', 'Thomas M', 'Sniecinski I', 'Forman SJ']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879199500281 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10232739 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(1):36-45. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10232739.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients in both groups were identical except that both the recipient and the donor ages were, on average, higher in the alloPBSCT group (26 vs. 36 [p = 0.005] and 27 vs. 32 [p = 0.024], respectively). Patients received similar therapy excluding posttransplant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration (97% in alloBMT vs. 12.5% in alloPBSCT). The median time to reach neutrophil counts >0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet counts >20 x 10(9)/L was 13 and 14 days, respectively, in patients receiving alloPBSCTs compared with 19 and 27 days in patients receiving alloBMTs (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0002). The alloPBSCT group required similar transfusions of red blood cells or platelets. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (aGVHD) was similar in both groups. However, chronic GVHD (cGVHD) of all grades developed in 78.1% of patients in the alloPBSCT group after a median follow-up period of 12.5 (range 0.5-34) months. In alloBMT recipients, cGVHD of all grades developed in 21.4% after a median follow-up period of 38 (range 0.5-62) months (p = 0.00001). Day 100 transplant-related mortality was also similar: 20% (8 of 40) in the alloBMT patients and 17.5% (7 of 40) in the alloPBSCT group. Although not statistically significant, a relatively higher relapse rate occurred in the alloBMT group (21.4 vs. 10.7%). The estimated disease-free survival in month 24 was 51.3% for alloBMT and 54.6% for alloPBSCT, and the estimated overall survival in month 24 was 56.1% for alloBMT and 64.6% for alloPBSCT. In conclusion, this retrospective comparison suggests that alloPBSCT from HLA-identical donors is associated with faster engraftment, fewer transfusions, and no greater incidence of aGVHD, but a high incidence of cGVHD.","['Ustun, C', 'Arslan, O', 'Beksac, M', 'Koc, H', 'Gurman, G', 'Ozcelik, T', 'Yilmaz, B', 'Ilhan, O', 'Akan, H', 'Ozcan, M', 'Demirer, T', 'Uysal, A', 'Konuk, N', 'Arat, M', 'Dilek, I', 'Celebi, H', 'Coskun, H S']","['Ustun C', 'Arslan O', 'Beksac M', 'Koc H', 'Gurman G', 'Ozcelik T', 'Yilmaz B', 'Ilhan O', 'Akan H', 'Ozcan M', 'Demirer T', 'Uysal A', 'Konuk N', 'Arat M', 'Dilek I', 'Celebi H', 'Coskun HS']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ibni Sina Hospital, Medical School of Ankara, Ankara University, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(99)50027-X [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10232738 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(1):28-35. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10232738.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, DCs were differentiated using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells that had been mobilized into the peripheral blood. To use the phagocytic activity of DCs for processing and presentation of tumor antigens, we established DC clusters containing immature DCs by preserving proliferating cell clusters without mechanical disruption. After an 11-day culture, the developed clusters contained not only typical mature DCs but also immature DCs that showed active phagocytosis of latex particles, suggesting that the clusters consisted of DCs of different maturational stages. These heterogeneous clusters could present an exogenous protein antigen, keyhold limpet hemocyanin, to both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Furthermore, in three acute myelogeneous leukemia patients, clusters pulsed with autologous irradiated leukemic cells could also induce antileukemic CTLs. The mechanical disruption of clusters abrogated the induction of CTLs to leukemic cells as well as to hemocyanin. This observation gives an important information for the use of heterogeneous DC clusters derived from autologous peripheral blood CD34+ cells in the case of immunotherapy for leukemia.","['Fujii, S', 'Fujimoto, K', 'Shimizu, K', 'Ezaki, T', 'Kawano, F', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Kawakita, M', 'Matsuno, K']","['Fujii S', 'Fujimoto K', 'Shimizu K', 'Ezaki T', 'Kawano F', 'Takatsuki K', 'Kawakita M', 'Matsuno K']","['The Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Institute for Clinical Research, Kumamoto National Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)', 'FV4Y0JO2CX (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Hemocyanins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 May 1;59(9):2150-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ML-I exerts potent immunomodulating and cytotoxic effects, although its mechanism of action is largely unknown. We show that treatment of leukemic T- and B-cell lines with ML-I induced apoptosis, which required the prior activation of proteases of the caspase family. The involvement of caspases is demonstrated because (a) a peptide caspase inhibitor almost completely prevented ML-I-induced cell death and (b) proteolytic activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 was observed. Because caspase-8 has been implicated as a regulator of apoptosis mediated by death receptors, we further investigated a potential receptor involvement in ML-I-induced effects. Cell death triggered by ML-I was neither attenuated in cell clones resistant to CD95 nor in cells that were rendered refractory to other death receptors by overexpressing a dominant-negative FADD mutant. In contrast, ML-I triggered a receptor-independent mitochondria-controlled apoptotic pathway because it rapidly induced the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Because ML-I was also observed to enhance the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, these data may provide a molecular basis for clinical trials using MLs in anticancer therapy.","['Bantel, H', 'Engels, I H', 'Voelter, W', 'Schulze-Osthoff, K', 'Wesselborg, S']","['Bantel H', 'Engels IH', 'Voelter W', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Wesselborg S']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (mistletoe lectin I)', '0 (ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Mitomycin/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Plant Preparations', 'Plant Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2', 'Toxins, Biological/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 May 1;59(9):2083-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signals that control MDM2 expression are poorly understood but are likely to play an important role in the regulation of p53 activity. We show here that the half-life of MDM2 protein is shorter in proliferating than in quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also demonstrate that MDM2 protein half-life is extended in some, but not all, p53 mutant human leukemic cell lines. In at least one of these p53 mutant lines, increased MDM2 protein stability is associated with higher amounts of MDM2 protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that MDM2 protein accumulates to a much greater extent in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells containing unstable MDM2 than in cells possessing stable MDM2.

Altered cell surface pattern is involved in all aspects of HIV-induced pathogenesis such as viral spreading viral adhesion and cellular apoptosis and is an important parameter for therapeutical approaches. The regulatory mechanism is not homogenous for all proteins but includes divergent effects like modulation of gene transcription and proteolytic cleavage. Modulation by viral infection might be either a direct or an indirect effect. Various viral proteins have been implicated in direct modulation like the regulatory proteins Tat, Nef and Vpu, but also the envelope proteins gp 120 and gp41. In addition, infection by HIV-1 has been shown to modulate expression of various cytokines including IL-10 and IFN-gamma. The altered expression of various surface proteins might be an indirect effect of cytokines acting on B cells, T cells and monocytic cells. By virus capture assays the presence of further proteins on viral surface was demonstrated indicating a possible function for viral life cycle. To study the modulation of expression of those additional important surface molecules by HIV and its biological function for the pathogenesis will be the aim of further studies in our laboratory.","['Speth, C', 'Dierich, M P']","['Speth C', 'Dierich MP']","['Institute for Hygiene and Ludwig-Boltzmann-Institute for AIDS Research, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'CD28 Antigens/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV Infections/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Complement/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401322 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13 Suppl 1:S99-105. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401322.,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-treated patients have low white blood cell counts and a fair number of BCR-ABL-negative colony-forming cells in the peripheral blood. Particularly, IFN responders show increased numbers of normal hematopoietic cells. We have quantitatively analyzed progenitor cells in PBMNCs of IFN-treated patients by combining the clonogenic assay in semisolid medium with interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Thus, the identification is possible of the BCR-ABL status of colony-forming progenitor cells. In IFN-treated patients, the number of BCR-ABL-positive CFCs is considerably decreased and BCR-ABL-negative CFCs appear in the peripheral blood. We could show that after LTC for 35 days of the same PBMNCs on irradiated allogeneic normal stromal cells residual BCR-ABL sequence-positive CFCs were still present. In some cases the relative number of BCR-ABL sequence-positive CFCs was found to be increased after LTC. A minor proportion of blood samples from IFN-treated patients did not give rise to CFCs after LTC on allogeneic stromal cells (three of 10 patients). Inter- and intraindividual variations can be found with regard to loss or gain of BCR-ABL sequence-positive colonies after LTC. We conclude that early CML progenitor cells persist in the peripheral blood of IFN-treated patients and that a certain proportion may survive long-term culture.","['Pasternak, G', 'Schultheis, B', 'Heissig, B', 'Horner, S', 'Sick, C', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Pasternak G', 'Schultheis B', 'Heissig B', 'Horner S', 'Sick C', 'Hehlmann R']","['III Medizinische Klinik des Klinikum Mannheim, Fakultat fur Klinische Medizin der Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Stromal Cells', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401288 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13 Suppl 1:S55-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401288.,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their use in gene therapy protocols is still limited by a low level of transduction efficiency. In addition to the cell cycling block to retrovirus transduction, we recently demonstrated that the low level of retrovirus receptor mRNA in mouse HSC correlated with the low level of amphotropic retrovirus transduction in these cells. Similarly, we found low levels of mRNA encoding the amphotropic retrovirus receptor in human bone marrow Lin CD34+ CD38- HSC. In an effort to identify an alternative population of human HSC that might be more efficiently transduced, we assayed HSC populations from cord blood for mRNA encoding the amphotropic retrovirus receptor.

We successfully generated a SHIV (designated as NM-3rN) having the HIV-1 env gene, which enabled the evaluation of the efficacy of HIV-1 Env-targeted vaccines in macaque monkeys instead of chimpanzees. Two NM-3rN derivatives (NM-3 and NM-3n) induced long-term anti-virus immunities without manifesting the disease. The monkeys vaccinated with NM-3 or NM-3n became resistant to a challenge inoculation with NM-3rN. Serum from a monkey vaccinated with NM-3 neutralized not only the parental HIV-1 (NL432), but also an antigenically different HIV-1 (MN). In vivo experiments confirmed the heterologous protection against an SHIV having the HIV-1 (MN) env. In addition to specific immunity including neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, nonspecific immunity such as natural killer activity is associated with this protection.

Examples from Finland show that deficits of up to 5-25% are possible in leukaemia and multiple myeloma. The populations to be compared may also have large differences in the age distribution. As the risk of all cancer, also for leukaemia and lymphomas, increases strongly by age, it is crucial that care is taken about the age adjustment before showing the incidence rates for comparisons. The age adjustment can be done using different methods and standards. In practice, the choice of methods for comparative purposes is often not crucial. It is also essential to evaluate the age-specific rates when making comparisons between populations. For cancer prevalence it would be important to know which patients can be considered cured. A population-based cancer registry does not, as a rule, have this information. However, if a cancer registry follows up the patients, survival rates of the patients may, after a number of follow-up years, start to resemble those in a comparable general population group. This is an indication that the living patients are cured and should be deducted from cancer prevalence. Advances would also be needed in statistical methods and improvement in the quality and coverage of cancer registration.","['Hakulinen, T']",['Hakulinen T'],"['Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection/*methods', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401282 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13 Suppl 1:S37-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401282.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Megakaryocytic growth factors: is there a new approach for management of thrombocytopenia in patients with malignancies?,S14-8,"C-mpl ligand acts primarily as a lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factor by promoting proliferation of megakaryocyte precursors and their differentiation into megakaryocytes and platelets. In addition to the ability of c-mpl ligand to support megakaryocytic development from CD34+ precursor cells, several lines of evidence also point to a stimulatory effect on hematopoietic stem cells. When recombinant thrombopoietin or pegylated megakaryocyte growth and development factor is administered to normal animals or humans, there is a dose-dependent increase in the platelet count. When administered following chemotherapy in animal models or humans, c-mpl ligands reduce the duration and sometimes the degree of thrombocytopenia. The issue of whether clinically relevant thrombocytopenia can be ameliorated has so far been more difficult to resolve. Because severe thrombocytopenia is not commonly seen with standard chemotherapy regimens, clinical studies examining c-mpl ligands for their ability to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia will focus on treatment of acute leukemias and bone marrow transplantation. The potential utility of c-mpl ligands for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemias, or in HIV infection, will have to be evaluated in the future. Possibly the greatest potential of thrombopoietic growth factors in the near future may be in transfusion medicine, to collect and to store platelets from healthy donors or in autologous settings.","['Hofmann, W K', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Hofmann WK', 'Ottmann OG', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Haematology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Lecture', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/complications/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Carboplatin/toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'HIV Infections/blood/complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Papio', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1999/05/08 00:00,1999/05/08 00:01,['1999/05/08 00:00'],"['1999/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13 Suppl 1:S14-8.,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cell-free studies magnolol inhibited LTC4 synthase activity. LTA4 hydrolase activity was only inhibited at the higher concentration (2.5 x 10(-5)M).

In tumor cell lines, the rate of cell proliferation was correlated with expression of GM-CSF receptors. A monoclonal antibody to GM-CSF inhibited lymphocyte proliferation and blocked the GM-CSF binding of lymphocytes. Cells expressing GM-CSF receptor were Ig positive and both CD5 and CD11 positive (B-1a cell).

Priming with CKS-17/BLV in vitro, as well as CKS-17, significantly suppressed the mitogen-induced proliferative responses of spleen cells in naive BALB/c mice. In addition, priming of spleen cells with pep61 in vitro and in vivo resulted in suppression of lipopolysaccaride-induced B-cell proliferative response. This suppression was partially due to the basic amino acid sequence in the peptide because if the pep61-derived peptide lacking Arg was used, this inhibitory activity was partially restored. In contrast, pep61 enhanced both concanavalin A-stimulated proliferative response and IL-2 production.

The cell-cycling status of ALL cells shares many common features with that of normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, such as low number of resting G0 and cycling S phase cells even though the growth fraction is high. Thus, ALL cells should be in a long G1 phase. Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein is a crucial step in cell-cycle progression from G0/early G1 to late G1/S phase. We therefore analyzed the G1 distribution of these two immature cell populations by immunostaining and Western blot. Bone marrow samples from children with ALL at diagnosis as well as purified CD34+ cells, before and after in vitro stimulation with cytokines, were investigated for the expression of hypophosphorylated p110RB (early G1 phase), total retinoblastoma protein, statin (G0 phase), bromo-deoxyuridine (S phase), proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and p120 (cycling cells).

The second purpose of this study was to determine cell retention after the implantation of genetically engineered stent grafts. METHODS: Gene transfer efficiency was ascertained with the b-galactosidase assay. The target tissues included endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and human saphenous veins (HSVs). Polyurethane stent grafts were suffused with lac Z-transduced ECs and SMCs that were harvested from porcine jugular vein. The grafts were implanted into the iliac artery of each pig whose jugular vein had been harvested. Cell retention was analyzed at 1 and 4 weeks with X-Gal staining. RESULTS: VSVG-MuLV transduction efficiency exceeded that of ampho-MuLV in human ECs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 24, 89% +/- 6%; ampho-MuLV, n = 18, 14% +/- 6%; P <. 001), human SMCs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 5, 92% +/- 3%; ampho-MuLV, n = 4, 17% +/- 2%; P <.001), pig ECs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 4, 81% +/- 2%; ampho-MuLV, n = 4, 13% +/- 3%; P <.001), and pig SMCs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 5, 89% +/- 3%; ampho-MuLV, n = 4, 16% +/- 1%; P <.001). As much as a 10-fold higher transduction efficiency was observed with VSVG-MuLV in HSVs.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) sections of 26 cases of EMMT were re-examined. Immunostains for myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, neutrophil elastase, LCA, CD79a, CD20, CD43, CD45RO, CD3, CD30, CD15, CD68, MAC387, VS38C, MIC2, and the Leder stain for naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase were performed on all cases. Clinical and follow-up data were obtained through a questionnaire to the referring pathologist or from the notes of the patients where available. In the 10 cases with known myeloproliferative disease, the initial diagnosis was correct in 10 whereas all cases presenting with EMMT without a previous history of myeloproliferative disorder had an initial incorrect diagnosis. The most common suggested diagnosis was that of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The morphology of the tumours varied from well differentiated which included all stages of myeloid differentiation to poorly differentiated or blastic showing little or no evidence of myeloid differentiation. The proportion of positive cells for each stain varied. Chloroacetate esterase, myeloperoxidase and CD15 stained a large proportion of cells of the majority of the well differentiated tumours and a smaller proportion of the poorly differentiated/blastic tumours with very focal staining of some of the cases. Lysozyme and CD43 were the most sensitive of the markers staining a large proportion of cells of the majority of the tumours in both groups. Neutrophil elastase was the least sensitive of the markers of myeloid differentiation. CD79a, CD20, CD3 and CD30 were negative in all cases. CD43 was positive in all cases. CD68 stained a substantial number of cells in the majority of tumours. A smaller proportion of the tumours stained with MAC387. Four of the tumours showed positivity for MIC2. One tumour was positive for VS38C. CONCLUSION: This series documents continuing difficulties in the diagnosis of EMMT. Even well differentiated tumours are frequently mistakenly diagnosed as malignant lymphomas when they present without any history of antecedent myeloproliferative disorder. Careful evaluation of morphology for evidence of myeloid differentiation and a high index of suspicion when confronted with a less differentiated neoplasm are required to avoid this important diagnostic error. We suggest that a panel which includes chloroacetate-esterase, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme and CD43, together with other B- and T-lineage markers, in particular CD79a and CD3 should be used to confirm the diagnosis.","['Menasce, L P', 'Banerjee, S S', 'Beckett, E', 'Harris, M']","['Menasce LP', 'Banerjee SS', 'Beckett E', 'Harris M']","['Department of Histopathology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukosialin', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/metabolism']",1999/05/07 00:00,1999/05/07 00:01,['1999/05/07 00:00'],"['1999/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2559.1999.00651.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1999 May;34(5):391-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.1999.00651.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-7 induces proliferation and differentiation of immature thymocytes, and protects thymocytes from apoptosis by induction of bcl-2 expression. The regulation of IL-7 production is poorly characterized, although down-regulation by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been described. We measured the serum levels of IL-7 before and after bone marrow transplant (BMT) in 32 children undergoing BMT for genetic diseases (severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) and thalassemia), aplastic anemia, and acute lymphoblastic and non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL and ANLL). Prior to BMT, the highest IL-7 levels were observed in patients with SCID and ALL, i.e. those patients with genetic or acquired lymphopenia. Patients with thalassemia and ANLL had normal levels of IL-7. Over the 8 weeks following BMT, the IL-7 levels of patients with SCID and ALL fell as the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) increased. No detectable change in IL-7 levels was observed in the patients with thalassemia and ANLL. Levels of IL-7 were highest in the young infants with SCID compared to the age-matched controls. Together, the data demonstrate that serum levels of IL-7 in lymphopenic patients are inversely related to patient age and the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). The inverse relationship to ALC suggests that there is either direct regulation of stromal production or more likely, binding of secreted IL-7 to lymphocytes expressing IL-7 receptors.","['Bolotin, E', 'Annett, G', 'Parkman, R', 'Weinberg, K']","['Bolotin E', 'Annett G', 'Parkman R', 'Weinberg K']","[""Division of Research Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California School of Medicine, USA.""]",['eng'],"['1R01 HL54729/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '3 M01 RR00043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Interleukin-7)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-7/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/blood/therapy']",1999/05/07 00:00,1999/05/07 00:01,['1999/05/07 00:00'],"['1999/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701655 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Apr;23(8):783-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701655.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IgM on the surface of these B CLL cells is frequently polyreactive with respect to its capacity to recognize multiple structurally dissimilar antigens (Ag). OBJECTIVES: To understand the structural characteristics of the polyreactive binding sites of human IgM molecules expressed on B CLL cells by: (1) analyzing the nucleotide and protein sequences of the variable (V) domains of five IgM molecules expressed in cases of B CLL and; (2) utilizing these sequences to generate three-dimensional (3D) models of Fv (VL - VH) molecules. STUDY DESIGN: Peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from five cases of B CLL were tested for polyreactive binding properties by assessing their capacity to bind mouse IgG by indirect immunofluorescence. The V region genes of light and heavy chains were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, subsequently cloned and their nucleotide sequences obtained. Translated amino acid sequences of the V domains were used to generate homology models of the Fv molecules. RESULTS: Low affinity binding of mouse IgG was demonstrated for all B CLL samples examined, confirming the polyreactive nature of the IgM expressed on these cells. There was an absence or minimal mutation within V region genes when compared to germline Ig genes. Junctional diversity was not observed for VL regions, although truncations and insertions were frequent in D minigenes of VH regions. The binding sites were predicted to form either relatively flat surfaces with occasional protrusions or cavities at the VL - VH domain interface. Aromatic side chains covered a large proportion of the potential binding surfaces in the models of B CLL Fv components. DISCUSSION: Primary DNA sequences can be categorized as germline, suggesting that the B cells involved in B CLL are germline or naive in origin. The medium to large HCDR3s provide the majority of probable contact residues for antigens. While prominent aromatic residues are likely to engage in binding patterns which are conserved (e.g. mouse Ig reactivity), the diverse binding sites predicted for B CLL-derived IgMs also have properties which are conducive to polyreactive antigen binding.","['Ramsland, P A', 'Brock, C R', 'Moses, J', 'Robinson, B G', 'Edmundson, A B', 'Raison, R L']","['Ramsland PA', 'Brock CR', 'Moses J', 'Robinson BG', 'Edmundson AB', 'Raison RL']","['Immunobiology Unit, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['CA 72803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Immunotechnology,Immunotechnology : an international journal of immunological engineering,9511979,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'CD5 Antigens/immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/chemistry/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/chemistry/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Conformation']",1999/05/07 00:00,1999/05/07 00:01,['1999/05/07 00:00'],"['1999/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1380-2933(98)00025-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1380-2933(98)00025-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunotechnology. 1999 Mar;4(3-4):217-29. doi: 10.1016/s1380-2933(98)00025-6.,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF099192', 'GENBANK/AF099193', 'GENBANK/AF099194', 'GENBANK/AF099195', 'GENBANK/AF099196', 'GENBANK/AF099197', 'GENBANK/AF099198', 'GENBANK/AF099199', 'GENBANK/AF099200', 'GENBANK/AF099201']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence in cancer increased from 1960 to 1994; low grade astrocytoma accounted for most of the increase, whereas high grade astrocytoma has not increased in incidence. There has been a moderate increase in leukemia to about 1980. We found a parental age effect for both leukemia and brain cancer, with the former (of about 50% excess in those over 35 years) being mediated by maternal age and the latter (of about 25% excess) by paternal age. Accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and mutations during the maturation of germ cells is a likely mechanism for these findings.

With the indirect immunofluorescence technique, we observed that the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM) shifted its location from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (NPM-translocation). The degree of NPM-translocation was determined by the relative immunofluorescent intensity in the nucleoli vs the nucleoplasm (defined as localization index, LI). We found that NPM-translocation, as determined by the decrease of LI, correlates with cytotoxicity. The degrees of NPM-translocation, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation in HeLa cells were determined after treatment with 0.1, 0.5 and 1 microg/mL DA for 1 hr. We found that NPM-translocation (LI < 2.5) was observed in cells during the treatment with 0.5 and 1 but not with 0.1 microg/mL DA. Also, cells treated with 1 microg/mL remained in an NPM-translocated state for a longer time (5-6 hr) than those cells treated with 0.5 microg/mL (1-2 hr). Cells treated with 0.5 and 1 microg/mL DA showed increased levels of chromatin condensation beginning at 5 hr after the drug treatment. The number of cells with condensed chromatin increased with both time and drug concentration. No cells with condensed chromatin were observed in samples treated with 0.1 microg/mL DA, which also showed no significant NPM-translocation. Similar results were observed for induction of DNA fragmentation. We found that the drug concentration required for induction of DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation coincided with the drug concentration required for NPM-translocation. Taken together, these results indicate that NPM-translocation correlates with apoptosis induced by daunomycin.","['Chan, P K', 'Chan, F Y']","['Chan PK', 'Chan FY']","['Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. pchan@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],['CA 42476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin']",1999/05/07 00:00,1999/05/07 00:01,['1999/05/07 00:00'],"['1999/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(99)00043-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00043-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Jun 1;57(11):1265-73. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00043-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During one treatment 0.5 mg of vincristine was erroneously injected into the lumbar subarachnoid space. Cerebrospinal fluid lavage was established within 2 h and continued for 24 h. After 7 days she developed a progressive sensorimotor paraplegia, which eventually stabilized as a paraparesis. Neurophysiological studies were consistent with an axonal type sensorimotor neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was normal. Vincristine binds to cells, blocking mitosis, thus causing cell death. The associated central nervous system lesions are those of an ascending chemical leptomeningitis and ventriculitis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Second malignancies were reviewed in 1,588 patients treated for Hodgkin's disease between 1940 and 1991. Treatment consisted of involved or extended field radiotherapy as a single modality or in combination with chemotherapy. Before the early 1970's, chemotherapy used (sequential) monodrug regimens. The mean follow-up was 8.3 years. The cumulative risk was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the risk of a normal population taken from epidemiological data of the National Cancer Institute. An estimate of radiation dose at the site of origin of the second malignancy was obtained from representative measurements employing an Alderson phantom. RESULTS: After 5, 10, 15 and 20 years the cumulative risk for all malignancies was 1.5%, 4.2%, 9.4% and 21%, respectively; for solid tumors it came to 1.2%, 3.1%, 7.9% and 19%; for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) the risk amounted to 0.1%, 0.9%, 1.4% and 1.9%; and for leukemia it was 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.6% and 0.6%. For the same time points the relative risk for all malignancies was calculated to be 1.1, 1.4, 1.8 and 2.5; for solid tumors it came to 1.0, 1.1, 1.6 and 2.5; for NHL it amounted to 3.3, 11.8, 9.3 and 8.0; and for leukemia it was 3.3, 3.1, 3.4 and 2.1. For combinations of radiotherapy and chemotherapy the risk for second malignancies was highest in patients receiving ABVD any time during their treatment. 51% of the second malignancies were located infield, 22% at the field border and 27% outfield. In those cases for which the cause of death was known, Hodgkin's disease accounted for 79% followed by second malignancies accounting for 8%. The results obtained in Freiburg fell within the range reported in international publications. CONCLUSION: The increased incidence of second malignancies in cured Hodgkin's patients is along-term risk making regular follow-up mandatory. Although part of the second malignancies are unrelated to therapy, there is a need to carefully collect the data from patients treated according to new protocols in order to detect any changes in the number or kind of second malignancies in due time. This may well lead to a reassessment of therapeutic concepts.","['Slanina, J', 'Heinemann, F', 'Henne, K', 'Moog, G', 'Frommhold, H']","['Slanina J', 'Heinemann F', 'Henne K', 'Moog G', 'Frommhold H']","['Abteilung Strahlentherapie, Radiologische Universitatsklinik, Freiburg/Br. slanina@mst1.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

In addition, tissue responses to irradiation are also sensitive to associated treatments, type of graft and a number of patient characteristics. Experimental studies have yielded a large body of data, the clinical relevance of which still requires definite validation through randomized trials. Fractionated TBI schemes are able to reduce late normal tissue toxicity, but the ultimate consequences of the fractional dose reduction do not appear to be equivocal. Thus, leukemia and lymphoma cells are probably more radiobiologically heterogeneous than previously thought, with several cell lines displaying relatively high radioresistance and repair capability patterns. The most primitive host-type hematopoietic stem cells are likely to be at least partly protected by TBI fractionation and may hamper late engraftment. Similarly, but with possibly conflicting consequences on the probability of engraftment, the persistence of a functional marrow stroma may also be fractionation-sensitive, while higher rejection rates have been reported after T-depletion grafts and fractionated TBI. In clinical practice (as for the performance of relevant clinical trials), the influence of these results are rather limited by the heavy logistic constraints created by a sophisticated and time-consuming procedure. Lastly, clinicians are now facing an increasing incidence of second cancers, at least partly induced by irradiation, which jeopardize the long-term prospects of otherwise cured patients.","['Dubray, B', 'Giraud, P', 'Helfre, S', 'Dendale, R', 'Cosset, J M']","['Dubray B', 'Giraud P', 'Helfre S', 'Dendale R', 'Cosset JM']","[""Departement d'oncologie-radiotherapie, institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Cancer Radiother,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique,9711272,,IM,"['Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1999/05/07 00:00,1999/05/07 00:01,['1999/05/07 00:00'],"['1999/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1278-3218(99)80046-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S1278-3218(99)80046-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Radiother. 1999 Mar-Apr;3(2):154-61. doi: 10.1016/S1278-3218(99)80046-8.,,,,,,Bases biologiques de l'irradiation corporelle totale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further phenotypic characterization of the receptor-bearing cells has shown that they do not express the Thy-1 Ag, suggesting that they are committed progenitor cells rather than CD34+ Thy+ stem cells. However, more than 80% of methanol-fixed CD34+ cells do bind MIP-1alpha, suggesting that these cells may possess a pool of internal receptors, although we were unable to induce cell surface expression by cytokine stimulation. The percentage of these CD34+, MIP-1alpha-R+ cells present in the CD34 compartment of NBM is significantly higher than in CML, implicating lack of binding sites as part of the mechanism for the loss of response to this chemokine seen in CML. Specific Ab to the MIP-1alpha receptor implicated in HIV infection, CCR5, revealed that very few CD34+ cells expressed these receptors and that expression was confined to the CD34+ Thy- progenitor population.

The epidemiologic evidence falls short of the strength and consistency of evidence that is required to come to a reasonable conclusion that RF emissions are a likely cause of one or more types of human cancer.

Here we examine the possibility that ubiquitin-proteasome is involved in regulating the levels of Bcl-2, which is abundantly expressed in M-07e cells, a granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent human leukaemic cell line. Apoptosis in M-07e cells, induced by GM-CSF withdrawal, was associated with a gradual cleavage of Bcl-2 into a 22 kDa fragment. Treatment of M-07e cells with benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-l-leucinal (Z-LLL-CHO; MG-132), a reversible ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor, markedly accelerated the cleavage of Bcl-2 and promoted cell death through the apoptotic pathway. The cleavage of Bcl-2 was inhibited by a caspase-3 (CPP32)-specific inhibitor [acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (DEVD-CHO)] but not caspase 1 inhibitor (acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO), suggesting that Bcl-2 is a proteolytic substrate of a caspase-3-like protease activated during apoptosis. The simultaneous addition of recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) to M-07e cultures delayed the activation of caspase 3 and Bcl-2 cleavage triggered by Z-LLL-CHO, suggesting that the activation of the GM-CSF signalling pathway can partly overcome the apoptotic effect induced by Z-LLL-CHO. Apoptosis induced by inhibition of the proteasome pathway was verified in studies with lactacystin, a highly specific and irreversible proteasome inhibitor. Lactacystin-induced apoptosis in M-07e cells was remarkably similar to that induced by Z-LLL-CHO, which included caspase 3 activation, cleavage of Bcl-2 into a 22 kDa fragment and, ultimately, cell death. These results showed that inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways can lead to the activation of a DEVD-CHO-sensitive caspase and induces Bcl-2 cleavage, which might have a role in mediating apoptosis in M-07e cells.","['Zhang, X M', 'Lin, H', 'Chen, C', 'Chen, B D']","['Zhang XM', 'Lin H', 'Chen C', 'Chen BD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '143313-51-3 (L 709049)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leupeptins/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",1999/05/07 00:00,1999/05/07 00:01,['1999/05/07 00:00'],"['1999/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem J. 1999 May 15;340 ( Pt 1):127-33.,PMC1220230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were screened for their activities against mouse leukemia L1210 and human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cell lines, and relationships of structure and antitumor activity in vitro are discussed. It was found that 8-thiocarbamoyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroimidazo[1, 5-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-thione (8c) exhibited activity comparable to that of 5-fluorouracil against both L1210 and KB cells. The existence of both 2-thioxo and 8-substituent with a thioxo group in the molecule is crucial for the cytotoxicity against L1210 and KB cells. A novel procedure for introduction of a double bond between C-3 and C-4 in 8c was developed. Introduction of the 3,4-double bond increased the activity against L1210, but against KB cells the activity decreased by 4-fold. Cytotoxicity of compounds 8c and 8-thiocarbamoyl-1,2-dihydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-2(1H)-thione (11c) against human solid tumor and leukemia cell lines was further evaluated.

As demonstrated for hairy cell leukemia and follicular lymphoma, bone marrow trephine biopsy specimen immunostaining (BMT/IS) can successfully detect residual malignant cells. The aim of this study was to use BMT/IS and computerized image analysis (CIMA) of bcl-2-positive cells to quantify RD in B-CLL patients in CR, after achievement of CR and more than 1 year later. This methodology was compared with other conventional techniques, i.e., cytologic, flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis. BMT/IS readily detected RD in every trephine biopsy specimen examined, either after CR or at distant follow-up. CIMA allowed an objective quantification of residual B-CLL cells, as evidenced by the correlation with semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction results. Both analyses indicated a progression of RD. This finding was also supported (but inconsistently) by the other techniques. CIMA with an interstitial labeling index, therefore, seems to be a reproducible and sensitive method to detect persistence and progression of RD in patients with B-CLL. This method could apply to other hematologic malignancies infiltrating the bone marrow.","['Gala, J L', 'Guiot, Y', 'Delannoy, A', 'Scheiff, J M', 'Philippe, M', 'Martiat, P']","['Gala JL', 'Guiot Y', 'Delannoy A', 'Scheiff JM', 'Philippe M', 'Martiat P']","['Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels, Belgium. gala@sang.ucl.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Remission Induction']",1999/05/06 00:00,1999/05/06 00:01,['1999/05/06 00:00'],"['1999/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1999 Apr;12(4):391-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Followup of 79 consecutive patients with JCA refractory to previous therapy, in whom chlorambucil treatment was initiated from 1982 to 1995. Mean treatment duration was 7 months in 72 patients and more than 20 months in 6 patients with amyloidosis and 1 with severe iridocyclitis. RESULTS: Within 6 months, remission was attained in 41 patients (52%): 29 of these relapsed after a mean period of 2.5 years (range 0.3-8.3). Twenty-one (27%) patients did not respond. Seven out of 11 patients with secondary amyloidosis had proteinuria, which cleared completely in 4 and almost completely in 1. In 16 patients (20%) chlorambucil was stopped because of side effects, and in 1 because of infection. After a mean followup of 8.5 years, 14 patients (18%) were in complete remission without drugs, 34 (43%) had minor symptoms only, but 26 (33%) had limitations in daily activities. Five (6%) had died (2 of leukemia; 2 of infection, 0.5 and 3.3 years after withdrawal of chlorambucil; 1 of amyloidosis).

Treatment with tunicamycin produced a 40-50% inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and this was associated with a 2-2.5-fold decrease in transporter affinity for glucose (Km) without a change in Vmax. Leukemic K562, U937 and HL60 cells expressed Glut-1 transporter protein. With K562 cells Glut-1 appeared as a broad band of 50-60 kDa, whereas with U937 and HL60 cells a diffuse band was observed at approximately 55 kDa. Treatment of K562 cells with tunicamycin for 18 h, resulted in extensive loss of the 50-60 kDa glycoprotein, appearance of a 30-40 kDa band and increased staining of a 45 kDa band. With U937 cells, tunicamycin treatment resulted in the appearance of a 30-40 kDa band and increased staining of a 45 kDa band. With HL60 cells loss of the 55 kDa Glut-1 band was observed and a band of 45 kDa appeared. Tunicamycin-treatment resulted in 75-90% inhibition in [3H]mannose incorporation but only 20-25% inhibition in [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporation. In contrast, tunicamycin had little effect on the viability and MTT responses of the cells used.

Constitutive basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and, usually, STAT3 and STAT5 was detected in all four IL-2-independent cell lines tested, but in none of the three IL-2-dependent cell lines. Similarly, there was no detectable basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5 in the leukemic cells from ATLL patients (0/8 and 0/3, respectively). However, stimulation with IL-2 resulted in Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in both leukemic ATLL cells and IL-2-dependent lines. Furthermore, expression of SHP-1 phosphatase which is a negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling, was lost in most IL-2 independent cell lines (3/4) but not in the leukemic ATLL cells (0/3).

The c-kit has been classified as CD117 and is especially useful in the differential diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analysed 104 consecutive cases (55 AML, 23 B-cell lineage ALL, three T-cell ALL, 11 blast crisis of chronic myeloproliferative disorders and 12 cases of myelodysplastic syndromes with more than 10% of blasts) referred to our Hospital for immunophenotypic diagnosis and compared the expression pattern of CD13, CD33 and CD117 using the same fluorochrome (phycoerythrin-PE). The recommendations of the EGIL group were followed in order to establish lineage involvement of the blastic population. The threshold used to assign positivity for CD117 was 10%. Bcr/abl, TEL/AML-1 and MLL rearrangements were assessed by molecular methods. CD117 expression was detected in 91% of AML and MDS. All the negative cases corresponded to acute monocytic leukemias. The calculated specificity for myeloid involvement was 0.86 for CD117, 0.36 for CD13 and 0.44 for CD33 (P < 0.005). CD117 was also positive in four cases of ALL. None of these cases showed bcr/abl or MLL rearrangements. In the light of these findings, CD117 expression should yield a higher score, at least one point, in the system currently applied for the diagnosis of biphenotypic acute leukemias (BAL) as its myeloid specificity is greater than that of CD13 and CD33. Moreover, its absence in AML could identify two subgroups of M5b cases. The coexpression of CD117 with cytoplasmic CD79a is often associated with CD7 reactivity, suggesting a stem cell disorder. CD117 should be included on a routine basis for the immunophenotypic diagnosis of acute leukemias.","['Nomdedeu, J F', 'Mateu, R', 'Altes, A', 'Llorente, A', 'Rio, C', 'Estivill, C', 'Lopez, O', 'Ubeda, J', 'Rubiol, E']","['Nomdedeu JF', 'Mateu R', 'Altes A', 'Llorente A', 'Rio C', 'Estivill C', 'Lopez O', 'Ubeda J', 'Rubiol E']","[""Seccio de Marcadors, Department d'Hematologia, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. jfnomde@santpau.es""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'CD13 Antigens/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1999/05/06 00:00,1999/05/06 00:01,['1999/05/06 00:00'],"['1999/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698001854 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00185-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Apr;23(4):341-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00185-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast we show here that ceramide induces non-apoptotic killing of malignant cells from patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and of normal B lymphocytes. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid readily induces apoptosis of B-CLL cells, indicating that this death pathway is fully functional in these cells. The ability of ceramide to activate the apoptotic protease caspase 3 in HL60 cells but not in B-CLL cells, as well as the lack of correlation of ceramide-mediated killing of different B-CLL isolates with expression of the apoptosis-regulating proteins bcl-2 and bax reinforce the conclusion that ceramide killing of B-CLL cells is by a non-apoptotic mechanism. Fludarabine treatment or gamma-irradiation of B-CLL cells resulted in ceramide elevation and in killing by both apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms, suggesting that a ceramide-triggered non-apoptotic mechanism may play a role in the killing of these cells. Therefore, the results here show that ceramide can induce either apoptotic or non-apoptotic death, depending on the cellular context.

To understand the biochemical basis of this transition, we have used the sibling HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, N1186 (IL-2 dependent) and N1186-94 (IL-2 independent), as models to assess the responses to antiproliferative signals. In N1186 cells arrested in G1 after serum/interleukin-2 (IL-2) deprivation, downregulation of the cyclin E-CDK2 kinase activity correlated with decreased phosphorylation of CDK2 and accumulation of p27Kip1 bound to the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, as seen in normal activated PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). In contrast, N1186-94 cells failed to arrest in G1 upon serum starvation, displayed constitutive cyclin E-associated kinase activity, and, although CDK2 was partially dephosphorylated, the amount of p27Kip1 bound to the complex did not increase. This observation, extended to two other IL-2-dependent as well as to three IL-2-independent HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, suggests that the lack of cyclin E-CDK2 kinase downregulation found in the late phase of HTLV-I transformation may correlate with insufficient amounts of p27Kip1 associated with the cyclin E-CDK2 complex. Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that the addition of p27Kip1 to lysates from N1186-94 starved cells resulted in the downregulation of cyclin E-associated kinase activity supporting the notion that the unresponsiveness of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex to growth inhibitory signals may be due to inadequate amounts of p27Kip1 assembled with the complex in HTLV-I-transformed T-cells. In fact, the amount of p27Kip1 protein was lower in most HTLV-I-transformed (IL-2-independent) than in the immortalized (IL-2-dependent) HTLV-I-infected T-cells. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K) induced an increase of p27Kip1 protein levels, which correlated with G1 arrest, in both IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent HTLV-I-infected T-cells. Altogether, these results suggest that maintaining a low level of expression of p27Kip1 is a key event in HTLV-I transformation.","['Cereseto, A', 'Washington Parks, R', 'Rivadeneira, E', 'Franchini, G']","['Cereseto A', 'Washington Parks R', 'Rivadeneira E', 'Franchini G']","['Basic Research Laboratory, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclin E/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology/virology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation']",1999/05/06 00:00,1999/05/06 00:01,['1999/05/06 00:00'],"['1999/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202567 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Apr 15;18(15):2441-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202567.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we characterized a gene that is involved in bufalin-induced apoptosis by the differential display (DD) technique. The partial nucleotide sequence of one of the differentially expressed clones obtained after treatment with bufalin was identical to that of the human gene for Tiam1. When U937 cells were treated with 10(-7) M bufalin, expression of both Tiam1 mRNA and the protein was induced 1 h after the start of the treatment. The increase of Tiam1 mRNA was transient but the level of Tiam1 protein continued to increase at least for 6 h. In addition, the activities of Rac1 and p21-activated kinase (PAK) were also stimulated by bufalin treatment. To evaluate the role of Tiam1 in the apoptotic process, we examined the effects of the expression of sense and antisense RNA for Tiam1 in U937 cells. Apoptosis was strongly induced by bufalin in cells that expressed sense RNA for Tiam1 as compared to apoptosis in control cells treated with bufalin only. Cells expressing antisense RNA for Tiaml were significantly more resistant than the control bufalin-treated cells to induction of DNA fragmentation in response to bufalin. Moreover, sense transformants had elevated activities of PAK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest that Tiaml might play a critical role in bufalin-induced apoptosis through the activation of Rac1, PAK, and JNK pathway.","['Kawazoe, N', 'Watabe, M', 'Masuda, Y', 'Nakajo, S', 'Nakaya, K']","['Kawazoe N', 'Watabe M', 'Masuda Y', 'Nakajo S', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (T-Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis-inducing Protein 1)', '0 (TIAM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis-inducing Protein 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'p21-Activated Kinases', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins']",1999/05/06 00:00,1999/05/06 00:01,['1999/05/06 00:00'],"['1999/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202555 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Apr 15;18(15):2413-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202555.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanisms of clonal evolution in the transformation to DLBL, we performed longitudinal molecular analyses of immunoglobulin (Ig), V(H)DJ(H) gene sequences expressed in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and follicular lymphoma (FL) that transformed to DLBL. Among the neoplastic CLL and SLL cells and their respective high-grade transformants, there was no evidence for a clonotypic shift or acquired mutations in the expressed Ig V(H)DJ(H) gene segments, as further confirmed by a specific and sensitive PCR-single strand polymorphism analysis. In contrast, among the FL cells there was a high degree of intraclonal diversification with highly divergent V(H)DJ(H) gene sequences. Despite this intraclonal heterogeneity, the related DLBL expressed a collinear but unique V(H)DJ(H) gene sequence. The intraclonal genealogical tree for the FL case demonstrated that the DLBL emerged in association with unique V(H)DJ(H) gene mutational events. Among the intraclonal FL and related DLBL transformants, the nature and distribution of the Ig V(H)DJ(H) gene mutations were consistent with antigenic selection. Thus, clonal evolution in the transformation from low- to high-grade B cell lymphoma may involve distinct pathways which vary according to the cellular origin and the type of the progenitor B cell tumor.","['Matolcsy, A', 'Schattner, E J', 'Knowles, D M', 'Casali, P']","['Matolcsy A', 'Schattner EJ', 'Knowles DM', 'Casali P']","['Department of Pathology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR040908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR 40908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation']",1999/05/06 02:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/05/06 02:04'],"['1999/05/06 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/05/06 02:04 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199904)29:04<1253::AID-IMMU1253>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1999 Apr;29(4):1253-64. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199904)29:04<1253::AID-IMMU1253>3.0.CO;2-8.,PMC4625534,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS727903'],,,,,,,

We conducted experiments on human tumor cell lines and determined the influence of a garlic powder preparation, a garlic extract (reported as 8-10% L(+)-alliin enriched), and a combination thereof, on cellular proliferation in cell cultures, employing the widely used indirect neutral red procedure. Garlic powder failed to inhibit the growth of human hepatoma HepG2 or human colorectal carcinoma Caco2 cells at concentrations of up to 1000 micrograms/ml. Garlic extract, in which the alliin content was highly enriched was also unable to inhibit the growth of these cells. However, when the garlic extract was supplemented with garlic powder (to 10% final concentration) there was a concentration-dependent clear inhibition of tumor cell growth (IC50 values of 330 micrograms/ml for HepG2 and 480 micrograms/ml for Caco-2 cells). The growth of the human lymphatic leukemia cell line CCRF CEM was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both garlic powder and garlic extract at concentrations as low as 30 micrograms/ml. However, no potentiation of this effect occurred upon mixing of the two preparations. Our results suggest that the antiproliferative effects of garlic may be due to breakdown products of alliin, such as allicin or polysulfides, rather than alliin itself, since the addition of an alliinase system (garlic powder) to an alliin enriched preparation without alliinase (garlic extract) potentiated the effects observed with the two preparations alone.","['Siegers, C P', 'Steffen, B', 'Robke, A', 'Pentz, R']","['Siegers CP', 'Steffen B', 'Robke A', 'Pentz R']","['Department of Toxicology, Medical University of Luebeck, Germany. siegers@medinf.mu-luebeck.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', '*Garlic', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', '*Plants, Medicinal', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/06 00:00,1999/05/06 00:01,['1999/05/06 00:00'],"['1999/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0944-7113(99)80028-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0944-7113(99)80028-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 1999 Mar;6(1):7-11. doi: 10.1016/S0944-7113(99)80028-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus drug-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia requires that the drug have an effect on both autoantigens and on the immune system.

These autoantibodies generally appear 6 months after treatment onset and are observed in 20% of treated patients. Hemolysis is however exceptional and is only clinically or biologically perceptible in 1 to 2% of the patients who become immunized. Induced lupus has been reported as have been several dozen cases of drug-induced hepatitis with anti-actin autoantibodies.

A review of current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches].,169-72,"Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in skin, bone marrow, bone, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and lymph nodes. Today, regarding its biological features, mastocytosis (with or without myeloid accompanying disorders) is considered to be a hematologic disease. The classification proposed by Metcalfe in 1991 is the most useful in caring for patients with mastocytosis. In this classification 4 groups are described: 1) indolent mastocytosis with or without extracutaneous involvement; 2) systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic disorder; 3) aggressive mastocytosis; 4) mast-cell leukemia. Cutaneous mastocytosis typically presents as urticaria pigmentosa or diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis and these patients usually have a benign course. On the contrary, systemic mastocytosis is a disease with an increased risk to develop an aggressive hematologic disorder. In these patients a second hematologic process, such as myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia, may occur. These patients often present without skin involvement and they have a very poor prognosis. Mast cell is a medium-sized granulated cell releasing chemical mediators (histamine, heparin, protease and cytokines). Mast cells originate from pluripotent hemopoietic progenitor cells that express the CD34 antigen. Mast cells are present in the bone marrow and are distributed throughout the connective tissues. Recently a mast-cell growth factor (MGF) has been identified. Clinical symptoms occur from the release of chemical mediators and the pathologic infiltration of cells. Although no effective therapy for patients with Mastocytosis is known, some patients may benefit from corticosteroid and interferon alpha treatment.

Hematopoietic stem cells are an attractive target for gene therapy of AIDS because of their ability to generate a broad repertoire of mature T lymphocytes, as well as the monocytic cells (macrophages, dendritic cells and microglia) which are also involved in HIV-1 pathogenesis. A number of synthetic ""anti-HIV-1 genes"" have been developed which inhibit HIV-1 replication. However, current methods for gene transfer into human hematopoietic stem cells, using retroviral vectors derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus, have been minimally effective. Clinical trials performed to date in which hematopoietic cells from HIV-1-positive patients have been transduced with retroviral vectors and then reinfused have produced low to undetectable levels of gene-containing peripheral blood leukocytes. New vector delivery systems, such as lentiviral vectors, need to be developed to ensure efficient gene transfer and persistent transgene expression to provide life-long resistance to the cells targeted by HIV-1.","['Engel, B C', 'Kohn, D B']","['Engel BC', 'Kohn DB']","['Division of Research Immunology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*therapy', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans']",1999/05/06 00:00,1999/05/06 00:01,['1999/05/06 00:00'],"['1999/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2741/engel [doi]'],epublish,Front Biosci. 1999 May 1;4:e26-33. doi: 10.2741/engel.,,82,,,,,,,,,,,19990501,,,,,,

The T cell response to the superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) was studied in detail. Vbeta8+ T cells showed a peak of DNA synthesis 16-24 h after SEB injection, and the percentage of BrdU+ CD4 and CD8 T cells was higher in blood than in lymph nodes and spleen. DNA synthesis was preceded by massive migration of Vbeta8+ cells from blood to lymphoid organs, in which the early activation marker CD69 was first up-regulated. SEB-nonspecific Vbeta6+ cells showed minimal stimulation but, when cycling, also expressed a high level of CD69. The other systems studied were injection of the IFN-gamma inducer polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, infection by the BM5 variants of murine leukemia virus (the causative agent of murine AIDS), and T cell expansion after transfer of normal bone marrow and lymph node cells into recombinase-activating gene-2-deficient mice. In each case, a peak of T cell proliferation was observed in blood. These data demonstrate the extensive redistribution of cycling T cells in the first few hours after activation. Kinetic studies of blood lymphocyte status appear crucial for understanding primary immune responses because cycling and redistributing T lymphocytes are enriched in the circulating compartment.","['Vasseur, F', 'Le Campion, A', 'Pavlovitch, J H', 'Penit, C']","['Vasseur F', 'Le Campion A', 'Pavlovitch JH', 'Penit C']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 345, Institut Necker, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (enterotoxin E, Staphylococcal)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle/*immunology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'DNA/biosynthesis/blood', 'Enterotoxins/pharmacology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology', 'Superantigens/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/immunology/pathology']",1999/05/05 00:00,1999/05/05 00:01,['1999/05/05 00:00'],"['1999/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 May 1;162(9):5164-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor-specific alleles were amplified from the PB obtained at day 8 post-transplant for 19 allo-PBSCT patients. Among the 19 patients, 12 showed only donor-specific alleles (complete chimerism) while 7 did both donor and host-specific alleles (mixed chimerism). Although donor specific alleles were amplified in 10 of 12 patients who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) similarly to allo-PBSCT, all of these ten showed mixed chimerism. When the chimeric state was examined in PB samples obtained serially at 2-3-day intervals post-transplant, host-specific alleles in allo-PBSCT patients were not detectable in the PB much earlier than those in allo-BMT patients. These findings indicate that the appearance of donor-derived cells associated with the disappearance of host-derived cells in the circulation occurs earlier after allo-PBSCT as compared with allo-BMT, leading to the rapid establishment of complete chimerism.","['Nakao, S', 'Zeng, W', 'Yamazaki, H', 'Wang, H', 'Takami, A', 'Sugimori, N', 'Miura, Y', 'Shiobara, S', 'Matsuda, T', 'Shinagawa, Y', 'Harada, M']","['Nakao S', 'Zeng W', 'Yamazaki H', 'Wang H', 'Takami A', 'Sugimori N', 'Miura Y', 'Shiobara S', 'Matsuda T', 'Shinagawa Y', 'Harada M']","['Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Isikawa, Japan. snakao@medkanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/genetics/*therapy', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', '*Minisatellite Repeats', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/genetics/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/05/05 00:00,1999/05/05 00:01,['1999/05/05 00:00'],"['1999/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01756.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Apr;62(4):265-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01756.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, CPT-propionate and CPT-butyrate demonstrated activities, while the other esters were practically inactive. Similarly, 9NC-propionate and 9NC-butyrate were active, while the other 9NC esters exhibited little or no activity. The biologically active esters required metabolic conversion (i.e., de-esterification) to their parental compounds as demonstrated by the conversion of CPT-propionate to CPT in mouse liver homogenate, and the topoisomerase I-inhibition assay.

The expression and phosphatase activity of SHP-1 were upregulated only when the 2 cell lines were differentiated to granulocytes. Furthermore, the changes were not dependent on the inducers or the growth inhibition.

Patients with resistant or relapsed lymphoid neoplasm have been treated with high-dose IL-2 with some responses. The aim of the present study is to determine whether there may be a biological justification for the use of low dose subcutaneous (s.c.) IL-2 as maintenance therapy in patients with lymphoid neoplasm in complete remission with high risk of relapse. We treated 15 patients with sc IL-2, 4.5 Million International Units (MIU) daily, 5 days per week for 12 consecutive weeks, in the outpatient clinic. This therapy was well tolerated and could be administered in an outpatient regimen. It increased the eosinophil count (p = 0.009), but the number of granulocytes, monocytes, T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes did not change. The number of natural killer (NK) cells increased from 11% to 35% of all lymphocytes during IL-2 therapy (p = 0.0006). Effector lymphokine-activated killer activity (eLAK) also increased from 6x10(-3) Lytic Units (LU)/ml to 80x10(-3) LU/ml (p = 0.02). All these changes reached a ""plateau"" after the 4th week of therapy. The increase in the number of NK cells correlated strongly with the increase in eLAK activity (r = 0.96, p<0.0001). Disease-free survival was determined in 14 patients who completed the treatment and compared with historical controls. Patients treated with IL-2 had the same relapse risk (median time to relapse 11.1 months, 95% confidence interval 5.5-16.6) as did controls (median time to relapse 9.7 months, 95% confidence interval 1-27.7) (p = 0.9). Low dose s.c. IL-2 stimulated NK proliferation, which generated cytotoxic activity in vivo in patients with lymphoid neoplasms.

However, the functional consequences of notch-1 overexpression in transformed cells remain unclear. We investigated whether endogenously expressed notch-1 controls cell fate determination in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells during pharmacologically induced differentiation. We found that notch-1 expression is modulated during MEL cell differentiation. Premature downregulation of notch-1 during differentiation, by antisense S-oligonucleotides or by enforced expression of antisense notch-1 mRNA, causes MEL cells to abort the differentiation program and undergo apoptosis. Downregulation of notch-1 expression in the absence of differentiation inducer increases the likelihood of spontaneous apoptosis. We conclude that in MEL cells, endogenous notch-1 expression controls the apoptotic threshold during differentiation and growth. In these cells, notch-1 allows differentiation by preventing apoptosis of pre-committed cells. This novel function of notch-1 may play a role in regulating apoptosis susceptibility in notch-1 expressing tumor cells.","['Shelly, L L', 'Fuchs, C', 'Miele, L']","['Shelly LL', 'Fuchs C', 'Miele L']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Center For Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/05 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/05/05 02:03'],"['1999/05/05 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/05/05 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19990501)73:2<164::AID-JCB3>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19990501)73:2<164::aid-jcb3>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1999 May 1;73(2):164-75. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19990501)73:2<164::aid-jcb3>3.0.co;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By extending the work to the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line, we aimed to evaluate some mechanistic aspects of this effect. Particularly, the possibility was examined that the antiproliferative action of the carotenoid is associated with induction of cell differentiation. Lycopene treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in HL-60 cell growth as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell counting. This effect was accompanied by inhibition of cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase as measured by flow cytometry. Lycopene alone induced cell differentiation as measured by phorbol ester-dependent reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium and expression of the cell surface antigen CD14. Results of several recent intervention studies with beta-carotene, which have revealed no beneficial effects of this carotenoid, suggest that a single dietary component cannot explain the anticancer effect of diets rich in vegetables and fruits. Thus another goal of our study was to examine whether lycopene has the ability to synergize with other natural anticancer compounds, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which when used alone are therapeutically active only at high and toxic concentrations. The combination of low concentrations of lycopene with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 exhibited a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and differentiation and an additive effect on cell cycle progression. Such synergistic antiproliferative and differentiating effects of lycopene and other compounds found in the diet and in plasma may suggest the inclusion of the carotenoid in the diet as a cancer-preventive measure.","['Amir, H', 'Karas, M', 'Giat, J', 'Danilenko, M', 'Levy, R', 'Yermiahu, T', 'Levy, J', 'Sharoni, Y']","['Amir H', 'Karas M', 'Giat J', 'Danilenko M', 'Levy R', 'Yermiahu T', 'Levy J', 'Sharoni Y']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '66772-14-3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carotenoids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Lycopene', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1999/05/05 00:00,1999/05/05 00:01,['1999/05/05 00:00'],"['1999/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635589909514756 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1999;33(1):105-12. doi: 10.1080/01635589909514756.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a decrease in Rb phosphorylation but without the induction of WAF1 protein. Anisomycin treatment activated NF kappa B in the WT cells as early as 0.5 hr after treatment but did not activate NF kappa B in the Y8 cells. Cycloheximide was neither as potent as anisomycin in arresting WT cells at G1 and inducing apoptosis in Y8 cells, nor as potent in decreasing Rb phosphorylation. The finding that caffeine could override the G1 arrest induced by anisomycin and cycloheximide in the WT cells further supports the idea that the effects of anisomycin or cycloheximide on the cell cycle are at the level of cell cycle regulation, and are likely not mediated exclusively through the inhibition of protein synthesis.","['He, A W', 'Cory, J G']","['He AW', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University, School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858-4354, USA.']",['eng'],['CA55540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anisomycin/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",1999/05/05 00:00,1999/05/05 00:01,['1999/05/05 00:00'],"['1999/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Jan-Feb;19(1A):421-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consumption rate of Ser and Arg by HL-60 cells was significantly higher than that of other cell lines. During apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by either sodium ascorbate, sodium 5,6-benzylidene-L-ascorbate (SBA) or dopamine, the consumption of nonpolar and polar amino acids (neutral or acidic) generally declined, except for Cys, Met and Arg, whereas the production of Gly and Glu was slightly increased. Since the intracellular concentration of cGMP was not significantly changed before and after ascorbate treatment, nitric oxide might not be involved in the ascorbate-induced apoptosis. The present data demonstrates that consumption rate of nonpolar and polar amino acid, whether neutral, acidic or basic, was reduced almost evenly during the apoptosis induction. This suggests that apoptosis-associated changes in the amino acid utilization might not be significantly affected by ATP depletion, which might be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.","['Sakagami, H', 'Yokote, Y', 'Kochi, M', 'Hara, E', 'Akahane, K']","['Sakagami H', 'Yokote Y', 'Kochi M', 'Hara E', 'Akahane K']","['Department of Dental Pharmacology, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Saitama, Japan. sakagami@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats']",1999/05/05 00:00,1999/05/05 00:01,['1999/05/05 00:00'],"['1999/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Jan-Feb;19(1A):329-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the potential role of the Fas/Fas ligand system in chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis has been studied. In the present study the relationship between the anti-leukemic effect of LD-Ara-C and the Fas/Fas ligand system was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human myeloid leukemia cell line HL60 was treated with LD-Ara-C in combination with anti-Fas IgM MoAb, and apoptosis in the treated cells was estimated by morphological observation, DNA electrophoresis and flow cytometry. Simultaneously, changes in Fas antigen expression on cells treated with LD-Ara-C were investigated. RESULTS: Only limited apoptosis was observed following treatment with LD-Ara-C alone or anti-Fas MoAb alone; however, a synergistic increase in apoptosis was observed by treatment with the MoAb in combination with pretreatment with LD-Ara-C. LD-Ara-C induced a slight but consistent increase in the expression of Fas antigen on the treated cells. Moreover, the expression of Fas antigen was enhanced by repeated administration of LD-Ara-C. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the possible involvement of the Fas/Fas ligand system in the anti-leukemic effect of LD-Ara-C therapy.","['Nakamura, S', 'Takeshima, M', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Ohtake, S', 'Matsuda, T']","['Nakamura S', 'Takeshima M', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ohtake S', 'Matsuda T']","['Third Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kanazawa University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/analysis/*physiology']",1999/05/05 00:00,1999/05/05 00:01,['1999/05/05 00:00'],"['1999/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Jan-Feb;19(1A):197-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection with both E. chaffeensis and E. sennetsu, but not HGE agent, in the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 almost completely inhibited by treatment with deferoxamine, a cell-permeable iron chelator. Transferrin receptors (TfRs) accumulated on both E. chaffeensis and E. sennetsu, but not HGE agent, inclusions in THP-1 cells or the cells of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Reverse transcription-PCR showed an increase in the level of TfR mRNA 6 h postinfection which peaked at 24 h postinfection with both E. chaffeensis and E. sennetsu infection in THP-1 or HL-60 cells. In contrast, HGE agent in THP-1 or HL-60 cells induced no increase in TfR mRNA levels. Heat treatment of E. chaffeensis or the addition of monodansylcadaverine, a transglutaminase inhibitor, 3 h prior to infection inhibited the up-regulation of TfR mRNA. The addition of oxytetracycline 6 h after E. chaffeensis infection caused a decrease in TfR mRNA which returned to the basal level by 24 h postinfection. These results indicate that both internalization and continuous proliferation of ehrlichial organisms or the production of ehrlichial proteins are required for the up-regulation of TfR mRNA. Results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that both E. chaffeensis and E. sennetsu infection increased the binding activity of iron-responsive protein 1 (IRP-1) to the iron-responsive element at 6 h postinfection and remained elevated at 24 h postinfection. However, HGE agent infection had no effect on IRP-1 binding activity. This result suggests that activation of IRP-1 and subsequent stabilization of TfR mRNA comprise the mechanism of TfR mRNA up-regulation by E. chaffeensis and E. sennetsu infection.","['Barnewall, R E', 'Ohashi, N', 'Rikihisa, Y']","['Barnewall RE', 'Ohashi N', 'Rikihisa Y']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1092, USA.']",['eng'],"['F32 AI009177/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI030010/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI30010/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F32AI09177/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'EC 4.2.1.3 (Iron Regulatory Protein 1)', 'I9N81SC5HD (monodansylcadaverine)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)', 'X20I9EN955 (Oxytetracycline)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cadaverine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Ehrlichia/*pathogenicity', 'Ehrlichia chaffeensis/*pathogenicity', 'Ehrlichiosis/*microbiology', 'Granulocytes/microbiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Iron Regulatory Protein 1', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxytetracycline/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Virulence']",1999/05/04 00:00,1999/05/04 00:01,['1999/05/04 00:00'],"['1999/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/IAI.67.5.2258-2265.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1999 May;67(5):2258-65. doi: 10.1128/IAI.67.5.2258-2265.1999.,PMC115965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long-lasting effect (median interval between 2 EA treatments: ca. 6 months) is partially the result of the massive loss of iron, a growth factor for erythropoesis.

This has been accomplished primarily by the use of leukoreduction filters although newer adaptations of centrifugal equipment allow for the reduction of WBCs to target range of <1 x 10(6) WBCs/product. Therapeutic WBC removal by centrifuge has been used for treatment of the effects due to elevated levels of WBCs or platelets. More specific cellular immunotherapy has included lymphocytapheresis for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE). Various mononuclear cell fractions collected by apheresis have been used for lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) cell therapy or autologous stem cell transplantation. The development of WBC adsorbent filters for therapeutic use has evolved as nonspecific filter materials have been demonstrated to show selective WBC removal, and filter columns permit therapeutic reductions in WBCs using online filtration therapy. Specific adsorption techniques, e.g., CD-34 selection, are in use in vitro and indicate directions for further developments in cellular immunotherapy.","['Smith, J W']",['Smith JW'],"['Oklahoma Blood Institute, Oklahoma City 73104, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ther Apher,Therapeutic apheresis : official journal of the International Society for Apheresis and the Japanese Society for Apheresis,9706703,,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/therapy', '*Blood Component Removal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy/methods']",1997/08/01 00:00,1999/05/04 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1744-9987.1997.tb00137.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Apher. 1997 Aug;1(3):203-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-9987.1997.tb00137.x.,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present cases were not associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and were at clinical stage IIE. In both cases, T-cell origin of the lymphoma cells was diagnosed immunohistochemically. The clinical courses of these two cases were different: one followed a very aggressive clinical course and the patient died 6 months after the diagnosis, whereas the other patient survived more than 2 years without adjuvant chemotherapy. Clinicopathological features of 23 patients with PGTL are summarized with regard to their differences from primary small intestinal T-cell lymphomas (PSITL) and by association with HTLV-1. The median age at onset of PGTL was 58 years. The gender ratio was male-dominant (M:F = 2.3:1). About two-thirds (10 of 17) of PGTL cases had evidence of HTLV-1 infection. The most common presenting symptom for PGTL was upper abdominal discomfort and/or pain (76%), whereas that in PSITL was weight loss (61%) and diarrhea (42%). Typical lesions for PGTL were large ulcerations at the corpus to antrum. Neoplastic cells had no typical morphological characteristics for PGTL including HTLV-1-associated cases. CD3+4+8- was the most frequently observed surface phenotype of PGTL cells. Laboratory findings at diagnosis were not informative. Most patients were treated by gastrectomy with or without chemotherapy. PGTL, excluding that with HTLV-1, showed better prognosis than PSITL, although PGTL with HTLV-1 had a poorer prognosis.","['Horie, R', 'Yatomi, Y', 'Wakabayashi, T', 'Ohno, Y', 'Eriguchi, M', 'Higashihara, M', 'Nakahara, K', 'Watanabe, T']","['Horie R', 'Yatomi Y', 'Wakabayashi T', 'Ohno Y', 'Eriguchi M', 'Higashihara M', 'Nakahara K', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diarrhea/etiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/virology', 'Weight Loss']",1999/05/04 00:00,1999/05/04 00:01,['1999/05/04 00:00'],"['1999/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/29.3.171 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;29(3):171-8. doi: 10.1093/jjco/29.3.171.,,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel alternative spliced cyclin-D1 transcript, called transcript[b], has been identified. The level of the variant transcript[b] was lower than that of the originally reported cyclin-D1 transcript, called transcript[a], in several human non-lymphoid cancer cell lines but the endogenous cellular expression of transcript[b] products has not yet been determined. Northern-blot analysis and reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that transcript[b] mRNA is well expressed in B-lymphoid cell lines with t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation and at much lower or undetectable levels in other cells. Western-blot analysis using a human cyclin-D1-specific monoclonal antibody, which can recognize and distinguish the products of transcripts [a] and [b], strongly suggested that the transcript [b] protein is indeed expressed in these B-cell lines.

It is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, expressed only in haematopoietic cells. It binds in vivo to the adaptor proteins Nck and Grb2, to the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn and to the small Rho-like GTPase Cdc42, which is required for formation of filopodia in fibroblasts and macrophages. WASP also interacts, directly or indirectly, with the actin cytoskeleton. Together with studies of a closely related, ubiquitously expressed protein named N-WASP, these findings suggest that WASP is a component of signalling pathways that control reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton in haematopoietic cells in response to external stimuli. In support of this idea, haematopoietic cells from WAS patients show defects in cytoskeletal organisation that compromise their ability to polarise and to migrate in response to physiological stimuli. These defects could account for many of the clinical features of WAS. WAS is now a candidate for gene therapy based on the delivery of a wild-type WASP gene to autologous haematopoietic stem cells. In addition, recent studies of cell defects in WAS patients suggest that it may prove possible, in time, to rescue WAS cells using more conventional drug therapies.","[""O'Sullivan, E"", 'Kinnon, C', 'Brickell, P']","[""O'Sullivan E"", 'Kinnon C', 'Brickell P']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Childhood Leukaemia, Molecular Haematology Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (WASL protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/*metabolism', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal']",1999/05/04 00:00,1999/05/04 00:01,['1999/05/04 00:00'],"['1999/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(98)00118-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00118-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1999 Mar-Apr;31(3-4):383-7. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00118-6.,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age was 45 years (range 18-67), most (60%) had an acute leukemia and all had fever of unknown origin (FUO). The total duration of neutropenia was a median of 17 days (range 9-33), and the total number of days with fever 10 days (range 6-39). Seven patients experienced mild-to- moderate infusion-related adverse events (IRAE). The serum creatinine and urea increased from baseline to end of therapy in 76 and 63% of cases, but the maximum levels reached were <130 micromol/l and <11 mmol/l, respectively, in all cases. Liver enzymes showed modest but significant increases in most patients during therapy, while bilirubin decreased in 74% of cases. Response to treatment (defervescence within 6 days without developing a fungal or nonfungal infection) was seen in 22 cases (73%, 95% CI 58-89%), while 8 episodes were considered treatment failures: 2 due to persistent FUO, 1 withdrew due to IRAE, 2 developed nonfungal infections and 3 developed a presumed or definite invasive mycosis. We conclude that low-dose ABLC is very safe and well tolerated and seems as effective as c-AmB for this indication.

We have directly compared the tyrosine kinase activity, in vitro transformation properties, and in vivo leukemogenic activity of the P190, P210, and P230 forms of BCR/ABL. P230 exhibited lower intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity than P210 and P190. Although all three oncogenes transformed both myeloid (32D cl3) and lymphoid (Ba/F3) interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell lines to become independent of IL-3 for survival and growth, their ability to stimulate proliferation of Ba/F3 lymphoid cells differed and correlated directly with tyrosine kinase activity. In a murine bone marrow transduction/transplantation model, the three forms of BCR/ABL were equally potent in the induction of a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like myeloproliferative syndrome in recipient mice when 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated donors were used. Analysis of proviral integration showed the CML-like disease to be polyclonal and to involve multiple myeloid and B lymphoid lineages, implicating a primitive multipotential target cell. Secondary transplantation revealed that only certain minor clones gave rise to day 12 spleen colonies and induced disease in secondary recipients, suggesting heterogeneity among the target cell population. In contrast, when marrow from non- 5-FU-treated donors was used, a mixture of CML-like disease, B lymphoid acute leukemia, and macrophage tumors was observed in recipients. P190 BCR/ABL induced lymphoid leukemia with shorter latency than P210 or P230. The lymphoid leukemias and macrophage tumors had provirus integration patterns that were oligo- or monoclonal and limited to the tumor cells, suggesting a lineage-restricted target cell with a requirement for additional events in addition to BCR/ABL transduction for full malignant transformation. These results do not support the hypothesis that P230 BCR/ABL induces a distinct and less aggressive form of CML in humans, and suggest that the rarity of P190 BCR/ABL in human CML may reflect infrequent BCR intron 1 breakpoints during the genesis of the Ph chromosome in stem cells, rather than intrinsic differences in myeloid leukemogenicity between P190 and P210.","['Li, S', 'Ilaria, R L Jr', 'Million, R P', 'Daley, G Q', 'Van Etten, R A']","['Li S', 'Ilaria RL Jr', 'Million RP', 'Daley GQ', 'Van Etten RA']","['Center for Blood Research, Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA57593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL03310/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncogenes', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Syndrome']",1999/05/04 02:01,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/05/04 02:01'],"['1999/05/04 02:01 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/05/04 02:01 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.189.9.1399 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1999 May 3;189(9):1399-412. doi: 10.1084/jem.189.9.1399.,PMC2193055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate here that the expression of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; E.C. 3.1.4.12) is induced during this process and is strongly elevated in differentiated THP-1 cells, as well as in differentiated human mononuclear phagocytes. Using Northern blotting, RNase protection assay, and nuclear run-on analyses, we show that the up-regulation of ASM expression is regulated mainly at the level of transcription and that new protein synthesis is required for enhanced ASM activity. This cell-type specific induction by PMA treatment was further investigated with respect to transcriptional control. A series of 5' deletion derivatives of the upstream regulatory region were used in transient transfection assays to identify promoter elements required for basal and inducible gene expression. A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -319 and -219 bp upstream of the initiation codon and co-transfections with transcription factor expression plasmids for AP-2 and Sp1 resulted in augmented ASM promoter activity, which was abolished when the binding sites for these two factors were deleted. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays we demonstrate that this region is specifically bound by Sp1 and AP-2. These factors are present in nuclear extracts prepared from both induced and uninduced THP-1 cells. However, the intensity of the complex formed appeared to increase when nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells were used. From these studies, we conclude that a concerted action of the transcription factors AP-2 and Sp1 is essential for the up -regulation of ASM expression during the process of macrophage differentiation.","['Langmann, T', 'Buechler, C', 'Ries, S', 'Schaeffler, A', 'Aslanidis, C', 'Schuierer, M', 'Weiler, M', 'Sandhoff, K', 'de Jong, P J', 'Schmitz, G']","['Langmann T', 'Buechler C', 'Ries S', 'Schaeffler A', 'Aslanidis C', 'Schuierer M', 'Weiler M', 'Sandhoff K', 'de Jong PJ', 'Schmitz G']","['Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Laboratoriumsmedizin, Klinikum der Universitat Regensburg, D-93042 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (acid sphingomyelinase-1)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (acid sphingomyelinase-2)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-2275(20)32122-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1999 May;40(5):870-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A potential candidate is AF6 which was originally identified as a fusion to ALL-1 in acute myeloid leukemia. In the present work the interaction between Ras and AF6 is characterized and compared with other effectors. The binding characteristics are quite similar to Raf and RalGEF, i.e. nucleotide dissociation as well as GTPase-activating protein activity are inhibited, whereas the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras is unperturbed by AF6 binding. Particularly, the dynamics of interaction are similar to Raf and RalGEF with a lifetime of the Ras. AF6 complex in the millisecond range. As probed by 31P NMR spectroscopy one of two major conformational states of Ras is stabilized by the interaction with AF6. Looking at the affinities of AF6 to a number of Ras mutants in the effector region, a specificity profile emerges distinct from that of other effector molecules. This finding may be useful in defining the biological function of AF6 by selectively switching off other pathways downstream of Ras using the appropriate effector mutant. Notably, among the Ras-related proteins AF6 binds most tightly to Rap1A which could imply a role of Rap1A in AF6 regulation.","['Linnemann, T', 'Geyer, M', 'Jaitner, B K', 'Block, C', 'Kalbitzer, H R', 'Wittinghofer, A', 'Herrmann, C']","['Linnemann T', 'Geyer M', 'Jaitner BK', 'Block C', 'Kalbitzer HR', 'Wittinghofer A', 'Herrmann C']","['Abteilung Strukturelle Biologie, Max-Planck-Institut fur Molekulare Physiologie, Postfach 102664, 44026 Dortmund, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (AFDN protein, human)', '0 (Phosphorus Isotopes)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinesins/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myosins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus Isotopes', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thermodynamics', 'ras Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.19.13556 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36914-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 May 7;274(19):13556-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.19.13556.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conjugation experiments showed that cefoxitin resistance, but not imipenem resistance, was transferable. All isolates were shown by isoelectric focusing to produce two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points of 5.4 (TEM-1, confirmed by sequencing of a PCR product) and >8.5 (consistent with a class C beta-lactamase). The gene coding for the unknown beta-lactamase was cloned and sequenced and revealed an enzyme which had 99.9% sequence identity with the plasmid-determined class C beta-lactamase CMY-2. The cloned beta-lactamase gene differed from blaCMY-2 at one nucleotide position that resulted in an amino acid change, tryptophan to arginine at position 221. We propose that this enzyme be designated CMY-4. Both the imipenem-resistant and -intermediate isolates lacked a 38-kDa outer membrane protein (OMP) that was present in the imipenem-sensitive isolate. The lack of an OMP alone did not explain the difference in carbapenem susceptibilities observed. However, measurement of beta-lactamase activities (including measurements under conditions where TEM-1 beta-lactamase was inhibited) indicated that the imipenem-intermediate isolate expressed six- to eightfold less beta-lactamase than did the other isolates. This study illustrates that carbapenem resistance in E. coli can arise from high-level expression of plasmid-mediated class C beta-lactamase combined with an OMP deficiency. Furthermore, in the presence of an OMP deficiency, the level of expression of a plasmid-mediated class C beta-lactamase is an important factor in determining whether E. coli isolates are fully resistant to carbapenems.","['Stapleton, P D', 'Shannon, K P', 'French, G L']","['Stapleton PD', 'Shannon KP', 'French GL']","[""Department of Microbiology, UMDS, St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. p.stapleton@ucl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['R01HL59923/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Carbapenems)', '6OEV9DX57Y (Cefoxitin)', 'EC 3.5.2.- (beta-lactamase CMY-2)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)']",IM,"['Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Carbapenems/*pharmacology', 'Cefoxitin/pharmacology', 'Cephalosporin Resistance/*genetics', 'Escherichia coli/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Plasmids', 'beta-Lactamases/*genetics']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.43.5.1206 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 May;43(5):1206-10. doi: 10.1128/AAC.43.5.1206.,PMC89134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although crusted scabies has been reported in association with HTLV-1 infection, to our knowledge it has never been described in association with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to describe a case of HTLV-1 associated myelopathy and concomitant crusted scabies. METHODS: This article includes a case report and a literature review. CONCLUSIONS: Crusted scabies is reported in association with HTLV-1 infection with or without concomitant ATLL. Crusted scabies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a generalized cutaneous eruption in an HTLV-1 positive patient. Patients with crusted scabies from an HTLV-1 endemic population should be rested for a possible HTLV-1 infection.

Proliferation of both cell lines was efficiently inhibited in a dose and compound dependent manner. Applying MTT-Assay, the IC50 of the most active compound didesmethyl-rocaglamide (1) was observed at 0.002 and 0.006 micrograms/ml (0.004 and 0.013 microM) depending on the cell line investigated. Bulky aminoacyl substituents at C-2, acetylation of the OH substituent at C-1 or insertion of a OH or OMe substituent at C-3 of the rocaglamide skeleton all diminished the activity of the compounds investigated. The aglain derivative 12 was inactive up to a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml (4.6 microM). This loss of activity is assumed to be mainly due to the presence of a pyran ring in the aglains vs. a furan ring as found in rocaglamide derivatives.

Efficient gene transfer systems also represent useful tools for basic research. Here we show that human primary lymphocytes and CD34+ cells can be efficiently transduced using a VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1-based gene transfer system. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was chosen as the marker transgene, because it can be easily visualized and quantitated using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, thus eliminating the need for selection or PCR to score transduction. Vectors produced with this system did not generate replication-competent retroviruses (RCRs) and efficiently transduced human cell lines (40-90%), PBMCs (60%), mobilized CD34+ cells (39%), and CD34+ cells from umbilical cord blood (60%) as measured by flow cytometry. Cells treated with AZT prior to infection did not express EGFP, ruling out passive protein or plasmid DNA transfer. This was further confirmed in methylcellulose cultures, where expression in myeloid and erythroid colonies was maintained for at least 3 weeks. In addition, this HIV-based vector was able to efficiently transduce freshly isolated, not-prestimulated CD34+ cells (70% EGFP positive) in serum-free medium. Under these same conditions, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector failed to transduce not-prestimulated CD34+ cells. These characteristics make this gene transfer system an excellent choice for both basic science and possible gene therapy applications.","['Douglas, J', 'Kelly, P', 'Evans, J T', 'Garcia, J V']","['Douglas J', 'Kelly P', 'Evans JT', 'Garcia JV']","[""Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['AI-39416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-53749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950018337 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Apr 10;10(6):935-45. doi: 10.1089/10430349950018337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that all combinations tested were genetically stable, but that vectors with therapeutic titers (0.5 to 2 x 10(6) colony-forming units/ml) could be achieved only by either partially or fully deleting the second intron of the Agamma-globin gene. Efficient transfer and high-level expression was achieved only when an optimized beta-globin promoter was linked to an Agamma-globin cassette containing an intact intron 1 and a 714-bp internal deletion of intron 2. When flanked by two copies of the HS-40 enhancer core from the alpha-globin locus, this cassette expressed gamma-globin mRNA at 46 +/- 19% per copy of mouse alpha-globin in the murine erythroleukemia cell line MEL585. Complete deletion of the first or second intron diminished expression to < or = 2.0%, and deletion of the HS-40 enhancer diminished expression to 7 +/- 8%. High-level, uniform expression of gamma-globin protein was confirmed in MEL585 clones (n = 12) transduced with the optimized vector. Efficient but variable expression of the optimized vector was also observed in erythroid progenitor colonies (n = 6) grown from transduced mouse bone marrow. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the role of intronic, promoter, and enhancer sequences on retrovirus vectors for human gamma-globin, and the development of an optimized vector capable of efficient expression in a murine erythroid cell line and primary cultures.","['Emery, D W', 'Morrish, F', 'Li, Q', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, G']","['Emery DW', 'Morrish F', 'Li Q', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],['HL 53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950018283 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Apr 10;10(6):877-88. doi: 10.1089/10430349950018283.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the p53 expressed by the wild-type L1210 cells was found to be a mutant form of p53 (relative to normal mouse fibroblast p53 sequence) having a point mutation in the DNA binding domain of p53. A deoxyadenosine-resistant L1210 cell line (Y8) derived from the parental WT cells had previously been shown to lack the expression of p53 but to respond to cycloheximide (CHX) treatment by superinduction of p53 mRNA. The mRNA for p53 induced by CHX had the same sequence as the p53 from normal mouse fibroblasts. Although the Y8 cells had no constitutive levels of p53 mRNA or protein, the Y8 cells expressed constitutive levels of WAF1 mRNA and protein. Gadd45 mRNA was also present in the Y8 cells. Subjecting the WT or Y8 cells to ionizing radiation did not result in a G0/G1 cell cycle block; the cells blocked in G2/M. The Y8 cells were much more sensitive to the irradiation treatment than the WT cells, resulting in marked increases in apoptosis in the Y8 cells. Although radiation treatment induced p53 mRNA, but no p53 protein, in the Y8 cells, WAF1 mRNA was induced in the Y8 cells. These data indicate that there are p53-independent pathway(s) that may still involve WAF1 and Gadd45 with respect to cell cycle control and apoptosis.","['He, A W', 'Cory, J G']","['He AW', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University, School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 55540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, jun/radiation effects', 'Genes, myc/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*genetics/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1998;10(9):455-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, they are highly vulnerable to adverse developmental sequelae from CNS-directed therapy. METHODS: Thirty patients younger than 12 months at diagnosis (12 males, 18 females) in first hematologic remission were evaluated after completion of ALL therapy (mean age = 62.1 months; standard deviation = 17.2 months; range = 38-102 months). CNS-directed treatment included very high dose infusions of methotrexate (MTX) and intrathecal cytarabine and MTX. Three patients had meningeal leukemia that required additional therapy. Children were administered the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, and parents completed a sociodemographic questionnaire to obtain information about occupation and education. RESULTS: Mean scores on all 6 cognitive and motor indices of the McCarthy Scales were in the average range (Verbal = 52.0; Perceptual = 53.6; Quantitative = 49.6; General Cognitive Index [GCI] = 102.1; Memory = 49.2; Motor = 51.0). Score distributions for each neurodevelopmental index were comparable to age-based population standards. One patient obtained a GCI that exceeded 2 standard deviations above the mean; none scored more than 2 standard deviations below. There was no report of developmental disabilities or neurologic disorders for any of the patients. Risk factors, including age at diagnosis, gender, additional CNS-directed treatment, and family socioeconomic status, were not associated with developmental outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Test findings indicated a generally positive neurodevelopmental outcome for ALL patients diagnosed in infancy who were treated with very high dose MTX as CNS-directed therapy. Combined with the reduction in the isolated CNS relapse rate achieved by the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) clinical trial CCG-107, the results of this study represent a substantial improvement in neurodevelopmental outcome for very young patients compared with infants treated for ALL in the past.","['Kaleita, T A', 'Reaman, G H', 'MacLean, W E', 'Sather, H N', 'Whitt, J K']","['Kaleita TA', 'Reaman GH', 'MacLean WE', 'Sather HN', 'Whitt JK']","['University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brain Damage, Chronic/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Cognition Disorders/epidemiology/etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Developmental Disabilities/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leucovorin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemic Infiltration/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Movement Disorders/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Survivors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1999/05/01 02:12,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/05/01 02:12'],"['1999/05/01 02:12 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/05/01 02:12 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990415)85:8<1859::AID-CNCR28>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990415)85:8<1859::aid-cncr28>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Apr 15;85(8):1859-65. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990415)85:8<1859::aid-cncr28>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors conducted a Phase II trial in which two drugs (etoposide and 5-fluorouracil) were added to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B cisplatin-mitomycin regimen in an effort to define a more effective chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty-five patients with confirmed Stage II malignant pleural mesothelioma were prospectively enrolled in the study. Thirty-one patients received cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on Day 1, 5-fluorouracil 600 mg on Days 1-4, folinic acid 100 mg/m2 on Days 1-4, mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 on Day 3, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 i.v. on Days 1-3, with prophylactic hematopoietic growth factors. Fourteen patients received cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and mitomycin C with the protocol unchanged, and oral etoposide 50 mg on Days 1-21 without growth factors (1 cycle every 28 days). Histology included epithelial (in 33 cases), sarcomatous (in 6), mixed (in 3), and unspecified type (in 3). RESULTS: Two hundred eleven cycles were administered. Treatment was well tolerated and the major toxicity was hematologic: anemia in 30% of cases, neutropenia in 24%, and 2 probable cases of mitomycin-induced pneumonitis. The objective response rate was 38% (17 of 45 were partial responses), and the median response duration was 12 months. The median survival time was 16 months. There were no differences in response or survival between the 31 patients treated with growth factors and the 14 patients treated without them. Survival was slightly better for responders than for nonresponders who had stable disease or progression (20 vs. 10 months, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This four-drug combination was effective, with a notably high response rate, acceptable toxicity, and good adherence to protocol doses.

Men with leukemia typically are of reproductive age and their fertility is threatened by initially impaired semen quality and cytotoxic chemotherapy. The authors examined the feasibility of sperm cryopreservation in men with leukemia before treatment and whether the type of leukemia is related to prefreeze or postthaw semen quality. METHODS: Records of 25 patients with acute (n=13) or chronic (n=12) leukemia who banked their sperm were reviewed. Semen characteristics were compared with those of normal donors (n=50) and between the 2 patient groups before and after cryopreservation. Motile sperm count (MSC), motility, curvilinear velocity (VCL), linearity, and amplitude of lateral head movement were compared between patients and healthy donors. No patient had undergone chemotherapy before sperm banking. The nitrogen vapor technique was used for sperm cryopreservation. RESULTS: Patients with leukemia had significantly lower prefreeze and postthaw MSC (P=0.0001), motility (P<0.05), and VCL (P<0.05) compared with healthy donors. The percentage change from prefreeze to postthaw in MSC and motility (P<0.05) was significantly greater in patients than in healthy donors. The effect of cryopreservation on semen quality was similar in patients with both acute and chronic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leukemia have poor prefreeze and postthaw semen quality compared with healthy donors. In this study the type of leukemia did not appear to affect prefreeze or postthaw semen quality and the postthaw MSC was sufficient for use with ICSI. Sperm cryopreservation should be offered to all men of reproductive age before the initiation of therapy for leukemia.","['Hallak, J', 'Kolettis, P N', 'Sekhon, V S', 'Thomas, A J Jr', 'Agarwal, A']","['Hallak J', 'Kolettis PN', 'Sekhon VS', 'Thomas AJ Jr', 'Agarwal A']","['Department of Urology, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', '*Cryopreservation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', '*Semen Preservation', 'Sperm Count', 'Sperm Motility']",1999/05/01 02:11,2000/03/18 09:00,['1999/05/01 02:11'],"['1999/05/01 02:11 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '1999/05/01 02:11 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990501)85:9<1973::AID-CNCR14>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1999 May 1;85(9):1973-8.,,,['Cancer. 1999 Nov 15;86(10):2184-5.

However, it is still unknown whether sIg+ B cells or differentiated plasma cells are the legitimate precursor cells from which MPCs develop. To address this question, C.B-17 scid/scid (SCID) mice were reconstituted with splenic surface Ig-positive (sIg+) B lineage cells originating from BALB/cRb6.15 (B/cRb6.15) or human IL-6 transgene-congenic BALB/cRb8.12 mice (B/cRb8.12 IL-6-Tg). Six of 80 SCID mice reconstituted with B/cRb6.15 sIg+ B cells developed MPCs after pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane) treatment followed by Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) infection (incidence 7.5%) and four of 40 after pristane treatment alone (incidence 10%). Similarly, in 20 SCID mice reconstituted with B/cRb8.12 IL-6-Tg splenic sIg+ B cells the MPC incidence was 10%. Karyotype analysis revealed that all the translocations were of typical t(12;15) type and all tumors carried the Rb6.15 or Rb8.12 marker chromosome, indicating their donor cell origin. In contrast, none of the 48 SCID mice reconstituted with plasma cells obtained from the lymph nodes of B/cRb8.12 IL-6-Tg mice developed MPCs when treated either with pristane plus A-MuLV (20 mice) or with pristane alone (28 mice), although the transferred plasma cells were still functional in the recipient SCID mice 6 months after transfer. The findings indicate that the malignant transformation triggered by Ig/myc juxtaposition occurs more in immature (sIgM+) and/or mature (sIgM+/sIgD+, sIgG+ and sIgA+) B cells than in differentiated G0 or cycling plasma cells. We inferred that immature and/or mature B cells and not differentiated plasma cells are most likely the principal source of precursor cells from which the typical t(12;15) MPCs develop.","['Ohno, S', 'Hayakawa, J', 'Hashimoto, N', 'Wiener, F']","['Ohno S', 'Hayakawa J', 'Hashimoto N', 'Wiener F']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Japan. shinohno@kenroku.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology/transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, myc', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/transplantation', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/20.4.529 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1999 Apr;20(4):529-38. doi: 10.1093/carcin/20.4.529.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Double class-II HLA-mismatch UCB units, from the Milan and New York cord blood banks, respectively, were used. Pre-transplant preparation consisted in fractionated total body irradiation in both cases, followed by cytoreductive high-dose cyclophosphamide for the 6-year-old with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and fludarabine-melphalan for the 11 1/2-year-old with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). Despite delayed haematopoietic recovery (probably due to HLA disparity) or reactivated cytomegalovirus infection in one boy, the immediate post-graft course was uneventful and extramedullary toxicity mild in both cases. Only transient acute graft-versus-host disease occurred, and complete donor chimerism was confirmed. Unfortunately, the out-come was unfavourable in both cases, the ANLL patient succumbing on day 96 due to pneumonia followed by multiorgan failure, and the ALL patient on day 140 due to combined medullar and central nervous system relapse.

Furthermore, ectopic expression of polyoma middle T antigen, which activates similar early signal transduction molecules as PDGF class receptors such as cFMS, accelerates these retinoic acid-induced effects. To determine if this depends on middle T's ability to activate PLCgamma, PI-3 kinase, and src-like kinases, stable transfectants of HL-60 cells expressing either the polyoma middle T dl23 mutant, which is defective for PLCgamma and PI-3 kinase activation, or the Delta205 mutant, which in addition has greatly attenuated src-like kinase activation ability, were created and compared to wild-type middle T-transfected HL-60. The transgenes were under control of the retinoic acid (or 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3) inducible Moloney murine leukemia virus LTRs. Expression of the dl23 or Delta205 mutant accelerated retinoic acid-induced cell differentiation. The effects of the mutants were comparable to those of the wild-type middle T. Likewise, retinoic acid-induced G0 arrest of mutant transfected cells and wild-type middle T transfected cells was similar. The same was true for 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3-induced monocytic differentiation as for retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation. The mutants did not cause the same slight shortening of the cell cycle as wild-type middle T. Both the mutants and the wild-type middle T caused a similar increase in the cellular basal level of activated ERK2 MAPK. Since retinoic acid increases ERK2 activation, which is necessary for differentiation, the data suggest that mutant and wild-type middle T enhanced the retinoic acid effects by increasing basal levels of ERK2 activation. Consistent with this, the polyoma-induced foreshortening of the time for differentiation coincided with the time for retinoic acid to significantly increase ERK2 activation. As in wild-type HL-60, retinoic acid induced the early down-regulation of RXRalpha in mutant transfectants similar to wild-type middle T transfectants, consistent with no loss or gain of relevant functions due to the mutations. In contrast, vitamin D3 did not down-regulate RXRalpha in HL-60 or transfectants. Polyoma middle T and these transformation-defective mutants thus enhanced ERK2 activation to have an early effect in promoting retinoic acid-induced differentiation without a strong dependence on activating PLCgamma, PI-3 kinase, or src-like kinase.","['Yen, A', 'Cherington, V', 'Schaffhausen, B', 'Marks, K', 'Varvayanis, S']","['Yen A', 'Cherington V', 'Schaffhausen B', 'Marks K', 'Varvayanis S']","['Department of Pathology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA034722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', '*Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Polyomavirus/*immunology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(99)94423-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1999.4423 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 May 1;248(2):538-51. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4423.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

We show that addition of leptomycin B to human primary fibroblasts increased the levels of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. This was accompanied by the induction of p53-dependent transcriptional activity in cultured cells and an increase in the levels of the products of two p53-responsive genes, the p21(CIP1/WAF1) and HDM2 proteins. Leptomycin B induced the accumulation of p53 and HDM2 in the nucleus and the appearance of discrete nuclear aggregates containing both proteins. It has been reported that the transcriptional activity of p53 is modulated by its interaction with the HDM2 protein which also targets p53 for rapid degradation. Using a model cell line conditionally expressing MDM2, the murine analogue of HDM2, we present evidence indicating that leptomycin B abrogates MDM2's role in p53 degradation and that the accumulation of p53 in distinct nuclear bodies is mediated by MDM2. Since HDM2 has recently been shown to contain a functional NES of the REV type, the most likely explanation for our results is that the effect of leptomycin B on HDM2 and p53 is due to the inhibition of nuclear export. The ability to visualize sites where p53 and HDM2 colocalize provides a new approach to study the association between the two proteins in vivo. These p53/HDM2-positive nuclear foci were found to also contain the U1A snRNP A and to be juxtaposed to the PML oncogenic domains.","['Lain, S', 'Midgley, C', 'Sparks, A', 'Lane, E B', 'Lane, D P']","['Lain S', 'Midgley C', 'Sparks A', 'Lane EB', 'Lane DP']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Dundee, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/isolation & purification', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclear/*isolation & purification', 'Transcription Factors/isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*isolation & purification', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482799944336 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1999.4433 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 May 1;248(2):457-72. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4433.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

This treatment significantly suppressed cell death and DNA fragmentation induced by a subsequent challenge with 1 mM H2O2. A more dramatic protection was observed when cells were pretreated with 0.25 mM H2O2. Pretreatment with either 0.05 or 0.25 mM H2O2 also imparted cells with a survival advantage against serum withdrawal and C2-ceramide treatment. H2O2 was found to be a mediator of cell death induced by serum withdrawal, but not by the addition of C2-ceramide. Interestingly, 0.25 mM H2O2 greatly induced glutathione peroxidase, a H2O2-consuming enzyme, whereas 0.05 mM H2O2 did not. Consistent with observation, pretreatment with 0.25 mM H2O2 resulted in a great reduction of cellular oxidant levels as determined by 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, and it also prevented elevation of oxidant levels upon subsequent challenge with 1 mM H2O2 or with serum withdrawal. These effects were not observed in cells pretreated with 0.05 mM H2O2. The sum of the data indicated that H2O2 suppresses cell death by two different mechanisms depending on its concentration: Relatively high concentrations enhance cellular antioxidant capacity, and lower concentrations block the lethal action of H2O2.","['Lee, B R', 'Um, H D']","['Lee BR', 'Um HD']","['Yonsei Medical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['*Adaptation, Biological', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', '*Cell Death', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Necrosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/isolation & purification', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(99)94409-9 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1999.4409 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 May 1;248(2):430-8. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4409.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

Results demonstrated a predominant expression of PKCtheta in lymphoid tissues and skeletal muscle. Expression levels of PKCtheta, as well as PKCalpha, delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta in the thymus, were not markedly changed during postnatal development. High levels of expression were observed in CD4(+) and CD8(+) single-positive T cells and CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes, while B cells were completely devoid of PKCtheta. PKCtheta was found also in platelets, but relatively low levels or no detection of PKCtheta expression were observed in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Highly proliferating leukemic T cells of established lines or primary tumors, but not freshly isolated resting peripheral blood T cells, exhibited high levels of membrane-bound PKCtheta. Increased proportions of PKCtheta in the particulate fraction was not restricted to malignant cells but correlated with the extent of proliferation of the T cells. Thus, human peripheral blood T cells that were induced to proliferate by exposure to mitogen and IL-2 expressed increased levels of PKCtheta in the particulate fraction. Significantly lower proportions of membrane-bound PKC were observed for five other isoenzymes expressed in T cells. The occurrence of PKCtheta in T, but not B, cells and its subcellular distribution in proliferating cells implicate PKCtheta in cellular mechanisms regulating the sustained proliferation of T cells.","['Meller, N', 'Elitzur, Y', 'Isakov, N']","['Meller N', 'Elitzur Y', 'Isakov N']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkcq protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase C/*isolation & purification', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology/growth & development', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(99)91478-8 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1999.1478 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1999 May 1;193(2):185-93. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1999.1478.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

Bovine leukemia virus, a retrovirus of the HTLV/BLV group, causes persistently increased numbers of peripheral blood B lymphocytes, known as persistent lymphocytosis (PL) and, in some animals, progression to B-cell leukemia and/or lymphoma. Here, we show that SHP-1 associates with the bovine leukemia virus transmembrane protein, gp30. This interaction is either direct or indirect. The interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, and the interaction increases after cell stimulation with sodium pervanadate. The gp30-SHP-1 interaction is seen in all of the BLV-infected, PL animals tested, but is not seen in uninfected animals or in most BLV-infected, non-PL animals, which do not express significant quantities of gp30. However, one BLV-infected, non-PL animal expressed large quantities of gp30, yet no gp30-SHP-1 interaction was detected, suggesting that there may be other factors in cells from the PL animals that facilitate the gp30-SHP-1 interaction. The association of gp30 and SHP-1 suggests the hypothesis that gp30 may act as a decoy to sequester SHP-1, resulting in up-regulation of B-cell receptor signaling. The implication of this could be a novel mechanism of viral activation of lymphocytes by removal of a down-regulatory phosphatase.","['Cantor, G H', 'Pritchard, S M', 'Orlik, O', 'Splitter, G A', 'Davis, W C', 'Reeves, R']","['Cantor GH', 'Pritchard SM', 'Orlik O', 'Splitter GA', 'Davis WC', 'Reeves R']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164-7040, USA.']",['eng'],['K08 AI01198/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (gp30 envelope transmembrane protein, Bovine leukemia virus)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1999/05/01 00:00,1999/05/01 00:01,['1999/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(99)91475-2 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1999.1475 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1999 May 1;193(2):117-24. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1999.1475.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

HDMP was administered in doses of 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days, and 20 mg/kg/day for another 7 days. In order to evaluate the effect of HDMP on the hemostatic system, the 8 patients studied here received HDMP (30 mg/kg/day) therapy for 4 days before the combined chemotherapy. These parameters were also studied in 12 healthy children as a control group. PC levels were normal in the patients while PS levels were decreased both before and after combined chemotherapies. Patients with ALL have laboratory signs of coagulation activation such as PF 1,2, TAT prior to initiation of chemotherapy. With combined chemotherapy, TAT levels were found to be normal while PF1,2 were not. TM levels were found to be increased both before and after therapies whereas HCFII and vWF levels were not different from those of the control group. The short course of HDMP therapy did not prominently influence these hemostatic parameters. These results indicate that both the malignant process and the drugs used in combined chemotherapy cause a decrease in natural inhibitors and an increase in procoagulant activity and endothelial injury.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is thought to represent the pathological counterpart of germinal center B-cell. High levels of TNF and its soluble receptors were found in the plasma of FL patients whereas the transcripts of these molecules were previously found to be present in FL patients lymph nodes. We therefore studied here the effects of TNF on the expression of costimulatory molecules implicated in the cytotoxic T cell response on purified FL cells. In contrast to results described with B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia, also characterized by high levels of circulating TNF, none of the tested samples showed a regulation of CD80, CD86, CD27 and CD70 in response to TNF. To confirm that the lack of regulation of these molecules was not due to the FL cells inability to modulate their expression, we therefore analyzed costimulatory molecules expression after CD40 pathway stimulation. After culture with human CD40L-transfected L-cells, an up-regulation of CD80, CD86 and CD70 expression was observed, while TNF addition in this model did not influence these changes. In this context, the CD27 molecule was down-regulated except in a single case, where its expression was increased. Taken together, this data demonstrates that in vitro expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86, CD27 and CD70, which are implicated in the anti-tumoral response, can be regulated by CD40 ligand but not by TNF.","['Renard, N', 'Ribeiro, P', 'Warzocha, K', 'Rouviere, R', 'Charlot, C', 'Coiffier, B', 'Salles, G']","['Renard N', 'Ribeiro P', 'Warzocha K', 'Rouviere R', 'Charlot C', 'Coiffier B', 'Salles G']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon et UPRES-JE 1879 Hemopathies Lymphoides Malignes, Pierre-Benite, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/physiology', 'CD40 Antigens/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/*physiology']",1999/04/30 00:00,1999/04/30 00:01,['1999/04/30 00:00'],"['1999/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909058433 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Apr;33(3-4):331-41. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058433.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is an unique example in which these features of AML are evident in an almost complete form; administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces differentiation of neoplastic cells into mature neutrophils and successfully induce complete remission in most patients. However, PMNs appearing during ATRA treatment are morphologically abnormal, as indicated not only by the presence of Auer rods but also by neutrophil secondary-granule deficiency that is commonly seen in AML. Moreover, ATRA has heterogeneous effects on the growth of blast progenitors in APL in different patients, being inhibitory, stimulatory or ineffective, which might account in part for the leukemia relapse in patients treated with ATRA alone. Hematopoietic growth factors regulate the growth of blast progenitors in APL. Among them, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is unique in that it preferentially stimulates clonal growth, but not self-renewal, in many APL cases, and synergistically enhances the differentiation-inducing effect of ATRA when used in combination. Many other compounds also exert such synergistic effects with ATRA, for which a variety of mechanisms have been suggested. It is crucial to precisely elucidate the functions of these molecules governing the growth/differentiation balance of AML blast progenitors and the mechanisms underlying their deregulated differentiation program in order to achieve effective differentiation therapy for patients with AML, not restricted to APL.","['Miyauchi, J']",['Miyauchi J'],"[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Children's Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1999/04/30 00:00,1999/04/30 00:01,['1999/04/30 00:00'],"['1999/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909058426 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Apr;33(3-4):267-80. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058426.,,138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Successful management of acquired AA including treatment with immunosuppressive agents, mainly antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporin or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, has resulted in long-term survival of many patients. The later evolution of complicating clonal disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia in patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy may be a manifestation of the natural history of the aplasia, the development of which may or may not be increased by immunosuppressive therapy. A persistent, profound deficiency and/or defect in the stem cell compartment, despite haematological recovery after immunosuppressive therapy, may create an unstable situation which predisposes to later clonal disorders. A review of the progression of AA to clonal disorders is now outlined.","['Tooze, J A', 'Marsh, J C', 'Gordon-Smith, E C']","['Tooze JA', 'Marsh JC', 'Gordon-Smith EC']","[""Department of Haematology, St George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/blood/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*physiopathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*physiopathology', 'Pancytopenia']",1999/04/30 00:00,1999/04/30 00:01,['1999/04/30 00:00'],"['1999/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909058423 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Apr;33(3-4):231-41. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058423.,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the development and validation of a PERV-specific Western immunoblot assay for the diagnostic testing of porcine xenografts recipients. This assay is based upon the serological cross-reactivity observed between PERV variants capable of infecting human cells in vitro and other mammalian C type retroviruses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strong reactivity between PERV expressing embryonic pig kidney PK-15 cells and antisera raised against whole virus preparations of murine leukemia virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), and simian sarcoma-associated virus was demonstrated by an immunofluorescence assay, suggesting specific antigenic cross-reactivity between this group of viruses and PERV. Western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that anti-GALV antisera reacted with three proteins in PK-15 cells having molecular masses of 30, 55, and 66 kDa. Antisera specific for the Gag proteins of either GALV or simian sarcoma-associated virus reacted with the 30-kDa (major) and 55-kDa (minor) proteins present in PK-15 cells and in PERV-infected 293 human kidney cells, likely representing reactivity to the processed and precursor forms of the PERV Gag protein, respectively. No reactivity was seen in uninfected 293 cells. Analysis of plasma samples from 200 United States blood donors and from 58 human immunodeficiency virus-1, 18 human immunodeficiency virus-2, 13 human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I, 21 human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-II, and 15 cytomegalovirus infected controls were negative. CONCLUSIONS: As this assay is based on PERV antigen derived from infected human cells, it clearly has the capacity to detect a serologic response towards PERV variants that have zoonotic potential and will allow for the accurate determination of PERV-specific seroreactivity in porcine xenograft recipients.","['Matthews, A L', 'Brown, J', 'Switzer, W', 'Folks, T M', 'Heneine, W', 'Sandstrom, P A']","['Matthews AL', 'Brown J', 'Switzer W', 'Folks TM', 'Heneine W', 'Sandstrom PA']","['HIV/Retrovirus Diseases Branch, Division of AIDS, STD, and TB Laboratory Research, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western/*methods', 'Cell Line/virology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Gammaretrovirus/*immunology/metabolism', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Swine/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1999/04/30 00:00,1999/04/30 00:01,['1999/04/30 00:00'],"['1999/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199904150-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1999 Apr 15;67(7):939-43. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199904150-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While retroviral genes themselves may be responsible for neuronal death, a retrovirus may also cause mutations in cellular genes. Hence, the prion gene may be altered by a retrovirus in the same way as a cellular proto-oncogene is altered to produce an oncogene, either by transduction or by integration of the provirus in its vicinity. In both cases, the resulting abnormal prion protein, acting as a catalyst, may induce the formation of amyloid plaques. In addition, a wild type retrovirus may recombine to the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to give rise to a pseudotyped retrovirus able to induce spongiosis. It is reported here that in scrapie, a blood monocytoid cell proliferates in vitro. If confirmed in other species, this raises the question of the potential link between prion disease and leukemia. Indeed neurovirulent strains of murine leukemia virus, a slow acting retrovirus, are known to induce spongiform encephalopathies. A preliminary attempt to purify reverse transcriptase by chromatography, using the classical protocol, failed because of the presence of a prion-like protein secreted by the blood mononuclear cells which stuck to the phosphocellulose column. Therefore, if a retrovirus is present in prion diseases, it would be evidenced only in animals developing the disease in the absence of prion protein.

To identify small molecules promoting this process, a chemical library was screened by using a myeloid leukemic cell line that retained the potential to differentiate in culture. In the presence of a purine derivative, aminopurvalanol (AP), cells acquired phenotypic characteristics of differentiated macrophages and became arrested in the cell cycle with a 4N DNA content. AP also inhibited mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts, suggesting that it acted on an evolutionarily conserved cell cycle regulatory pathway. Affinity chromatography and biochemical reconstitution experiments with Xenopus egg extracts identified cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1-cyclin B as a target of the compound. Although AP potently inhibited immunoprecipitates of both human CDK1 and CDK2 from human leukemic cell extracts, our results indicate that the compound preferentially targets the G2/M-phase transition in vivo.","['Rosania, G R', 'Merlie, J Jr', 'Gray, N', 'Chang, Y T', 'Schultz, P G', 'Heald, R']","['Rosania GR', 'Merlie J Jr', 'Gray N', 'Chang YT', 'Schultz PG', 'Heald R']","['Department of Chemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin B/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Purines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus']",1999/04/29 02:04,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/04/29 02:04'],"['1999/04/29 02:04 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/04/29 02:04 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.9.4797 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Apr 27;96(9):4797-802. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.9.4797.,PMC21771,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples from a patient who recently received an inadvertent transfusion of CML cells were evaluated for the presence of the bcr/abl translocation characteristic of CML. CASE REPORT: The patient, a 67-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarct, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure, was transfused for bleeding from colonic angiodysplasia. A volunteer blood donor reported that he had been diagnosed with CML 10 days after his donation. Three days after the donation, blood components from the donor with CML had been administered to the patient as nonirradiated red cells and platelets. Evaluation of donor blood by a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed the b3a2 transcript, indicating a bcr/abl translocation. Periodic testing of the patient's peripheral blood by the same technique demonstrated the presence of the b3a2 transcript on Days 74 and 75 after transfusion. The patient died of congestive heart failure 8 months after the transfusion. CONCLUSION: In this rare case of accidental transfusion of neoplastic cells, the findings document the persistence of the donor's neoplastic clone in the recipient for 75 days.","['Vargas, S O', 'Cannon, M E', 'Benjamin, R J', 'Longtine, J A']","['Vargas SO', 'Cannon ME', 'Benjamin RJ', 'Longtine JA']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Blood Donors', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Time Factors', '*Transfusion Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/04/29 00:00,1999/04/29 00:01,['1999/04/29 00:00'],"['1999/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39499235671.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1999 Apr;39(4):387-91. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39499235671.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using data from these records, a cohort of 31,651 polyethylene-on-metal total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients was followed up for cancer, using Finnish Cancer Registry data, from 1980 to 1995. During follow-up, 2,367 cancers were observed. There were statistically significantly fewer cancers among the THA patients (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.93). SIRs for cancers of the lung (0.69) and stomach (0.77) were significantly below unity. There was no significantly increased risk at any site. The SIR for cancer overall in male THA patients was below unity during the first 3 years after THA but returned to unity thereafter. The low SIR among men during the first 3 years was largely because the lung cancer SIR was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.35-0.62). In women, the SIR remained around 0.93 throughout follow-up. The SIR for stomach cancer was below unity only in women (SIR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.86). For cancer of the urinary bladder, the SIR during the first 3 years after THA was below unity but later slightly above it (SIR, 1.24 in relation to > or =3 years of follow-up; 95% CI, 0.99-1.52). For myeloma and leukemia, SIRs were greater than unity only for THA patients followed up for 3 to 9 years. The study findings, in contrast to previously reported findings, do not indicate that there is any increased risk of hematopoietic cancers after THA using polyethylene-on-metal prostheses. SIRs relating to soft tissue cancers and bone sarcomas did not differ significantly from unity. No sarcoma was observed at the site of a prosthesis. THA seems to play no major role in cancer causation.","['Paavolainen, P', 'Pukkala, E', 'Pulkkinen, P', 'Visuri, T']","['Paavolainen P', 'Pukkala E', 'Pulkkinen P', 'Visuri T']","['National Agency for Medicines, and the Department of Surgery, The Jorvi Hospital, Espoo, Finland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Arthroplasty,The Journal of arthroplasty,8703515,['0 (Metals)'],IM,"['Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hip Prosthesis/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Metals/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/29 02:04,2000/03/25 09:00,['1999/04/29 02:04'],"['1999/04/29 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/29 02:04 [entrez]']","['S0883-5403(99)90051-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0883-5403(99)90051-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Arthroplasty. 1999 Apr;14(3):272-80. doi: 10.1016/s0883-5403(99)90051-7.,,,,,,,,,,,['J Arthroplasty 2000 Jan;15(1):136-7'],,,,,,,,

An acquired extra X-chromosome was detected at diagnosis by conventional cytogenetics in 29 (88%) of 33 children with a high hyperdiploid karyotype and in 4 (33%) of 12 children with a low hyperdiploid karyotype. X-chromosome aneuploidy was retrospectively studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in eight and 20 patients with a normal and a hyperdiploid karyotype, respectively. PROCEDURE: A classical cytogenetic study was performed according to standard methods. FISH with the centromeric probe specific to X-chromosome was used to study interphase cells of bone marrow or blood samples. RESULTS: An extra X-chromosome was found by FISH in all 13 patients with a high hyperdiploid or tetraploid, in 6 of 7 patients with a low hyperdiploid, and in none with a normal karyotype. Two children with a normal karyotype displayed monosomy X. Altogether, 57.3% of newly diagnosed children displayed X-chromosome aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: Out study indicates that X-chromosome aneuploidy may be the most common chromosome abnormality in childhood ALL. It can be detected in nearly all children with a high hyperdiploid karyotype and up to one-half of the patients with a low hyperdiploid karyotype. FISH with an X-chromosome centromeric probe is a rapid and simple tool to detect an abnormal clone at diagnosis in the majority of children with ALL and is useful in confirming remission in these patients.","['Heinonen, K', 'Mahlamaki, E', 'Riikonen, P', 'Meltoranta, R L', 'Rahiala, J', 'Perkkio, M']","['Heinonen K', 'Mahlamaki E', 'Riikonen P', 'Meltoranta RL', 'Rahiala J', 'Perkkio M']","['Chromosome and DNA Laboratory, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland. kristiina.heinonen@kuh.fi']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', '*X Chromosome']",1999/04/29 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/29 02:03'],"['1999/04/29 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/29 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199905)32:5<360::AID-MPO9>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199905)32:5<360::aid-mpo9>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 May;32(5):360-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199905)32:5<360::aid-mpo9>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During chemotherapy induced neutropenia, colonization with fungi is considered a major risk factor for subsequent fungal infection. The rates and risk factors for mycotic infections in pediatric oncology patients is undetermined, particularly for centers in developing countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rates and risk factors of fungal colonization in children with acute leukemia and lymphoma at one of the major pediatric hematology/oncology centers in Turkey. PROCEDURE: Fifty-two consecutive children newly diagnosed with acute leukemia and lymphoma during intensive remission induction therapy were evaluated for the occurrence of fungal colonization (defined as at least one positive surveillance culture) and infection. RESULTS: Thirty-six of the 52 patients (69.2%) were colonized by Candida albicans which was the only fungus isolated from surveillance cultures. There were three (5.8%) proven systemic fungal infections: two cases of candidemia and one case of brain abscess with Aspergillus spp. isolated from tissue. All patients with fungal colonization were receiving prophylactic or curative antibiotics. No significant association was found between type of disease and fungal colonization, but there was a significant association with neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a high rate of fungal colonization in children receiving remission induction therapy for acute leukemia and lymphoma. Limiting the use of antibiotics and instituting antifungal chemoprophylaxis may decrease the rate, while the early initiation of empiric antifungal therapy in patients with fever and suspected mycotic colonization may increase survival in these patients.","['Gozdasoglu, S', 'Ertem, M', 'Buyukkececi, Z', 'Yavuzdemir, S', 'Bengisun, S', 'Ozenci, H', 'Tacyildiz, N', 'Unal, E', 'Yavuz, G', 'Deda, G', 'Aysev, D']","['Gozdasoglu S', 'Ertem M', 'Buyukkececi Z', 'Yavuzdemir S', 'Bengisun S', 'Ozenci H', 'Tacyildiz N', 'Unal E', 'Yavuz G', 'Deda G', 'Aysev D']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Research Center, Ankara University School of Medicine, Dikimevi, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Aspergillosis/chemically induced/*epidemiology', '*Aspergillus/isolation & purification', '*Candida albicans/isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Chemoprevention', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/microbiology']",1999/04/29 02:03,2000/03/04 09:00,['1999/04/29 02:03'],"['1999/04/29 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/29 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199905)32:5<344::AID-MPO6>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199905)32:5<344::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 May;32(5):344-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199905)32:5<344::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-6.,,,['Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Jan;34(1):76-7.

Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) shortens neutropenia following intensive chemotherapy, but potential benefits in the therapy of ALL remain inadequately explored. Accordingly, a randomized, crossover study was undertaken to clarify this issue. PROCEDURE: Seventeen children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and treated on standard protocols were randomized to receive G-CSF following either the first or second intensification blocks of chemotherapy. G-CSF was administered as a single daily subcutaneous injection of 5 mcg/kg from day 9 following the start of intensification therapy, and continued until the neutrophil count exceeded 0.5 x 10(9)/l for 3 days. Study endpoints were days of neutropenia (neutrophils < 1 x 10(9)/l) and severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 10(9)/l), days in hospital, days of fever, and days on antibiotics. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in the duration of neutropenia (95% confidence interval 3.8-8 days, P = 0.0001), severe neutropenia (95% confidence interval 1.8-7.4 days, P = 0.002), and days in hospital (95% confidence interval 0.9-6.3 days, P = 0.01) for children receiving G-CSF. Overall, the duration of neutropenia was longer following the second block (95% confidence interval 2.2-6.4 days, P = 0.0003), but this difference was abolished by G-CSF, and children, receiving G-CSF after the second intensification were more likely to restart maintenance chemotherapy on schedule (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF reduces the hematological toxicity of intensification chemotherapy and may allow improved compliance with treatment scheduling.","['Clarke, V', 'Dunstan, F D', 'Webb, D K']","['Clarke V', 'Dunstan FD', 'Webb DK']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, Llandough Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Patient Compliance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1999/04/29 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/29 02:03'],"['1999/04/29 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/29 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199905)32:5<331::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199905)32:5<331::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-m [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 May;32(5):331-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199905)32:5<331::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of chromosome 21-encoded genes thus leads to hematopoietic deficiencies. Of the genes found within the DS chromosomal region, core binding factor alpha (CBFA) is a candidate whose overexpression could affect hematopoietic development. To learn more about the pathogenesis of hematological diseases in DS, we studied hematopoietic precursor cells in Ts16 mice, an animal model for DS. We found reduced proportions of B lymphoid and myeloid cells in the liver and spleen, whereas the proportion of developing thymocyte populations and that of the erythroid cells in liver and spleen were increased. Furthermore, when analyzing the expression of Cbfa2 in both whole fetuses and isolated thymuses, we found no significant differences in the absolute amount of Cbfa2 mRNA or in the ratio of the isoforms Cbfa2.1 and Cbfa2.2 between Ts16 and diploid samples. Thus, a disequilibrium of Cbfa2 expression and a dysregulation of the two Cbfa2 mRNA species as a cause for the abnormalities in Ts16 fetuses in general and the deficient Ts16 thymocyte development in particular appears unlikely.","['Gjertson, C', 'Sturm, K S', 'Berger, C N']","['Gjertson C', 'Sturm KS', 'Berger CN']","['Department of Research, Kantonsspital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fetus/pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic System/embryology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Pregnancy', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1999/04/29 00:00,1999/04/29 00:01,['1999/04/29 00:00'],"['1999/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1521-6616(98)94685-X [pii]', '10.1006/clim.1998.4685 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 1999 Apr;91(1):50-60. doi: 10.1006/clim.1998.4685.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a 13-month period, 96 children from one to 16 years of age with a diagnosis of ALL were evaluated. When the study was initiated, 60 patients already undergoing chemotherapy received palliative treatment for complications (Group I). Thirty-six children (Group II) with newly diagnosed ALL received a daily preventive protocol consisting of: (1) elimination of bacterial plaque; (2) application of a mouthwash with a non-alcoholic solution of chlorhexidine 0.12% and (3) topical application of iodopovidone, followed by ""swish and swallow"" with nystatin 500,000 units. Children in both groups were examined every 7 to 14 days by our pediatric dentistry team. We found a significant improvement in oral hygiene (p = 0.001) and a significant decrease in the incidence of mucositis grade 2 (p = 0.0013) and oral candidiasis (p = 0.009) in the Group II children.

The particulate fraction is routinely removed by filtration prior to transplantation in order to reduce the risk of embolism. This study shows that the filter-retained fraction includes many multicellular complexes, previously defined as haematons. A haematon is a finely arborized stromal-web which is tightly packed with haemopoietic progenitor cells and differentiated postmitotic cells. Comparison of the pooled buffy coat and the filter-retained materials from healthy donors showed that the haematon fraction contained 8-40 x 10(6) CD34+ cells, 20-115 x 10(3) high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC) and 0.49-2.67 x 10(6) granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) which constituted 24+/-8% (10-36; n=8) of the total GM-CFU population harvested. Similar, but more variable recoveries of GM-CFU were obtained from the haematon fractions from patients with breast cancer (21+/-13%; n=10), Hodgkin's disease (33+/-19%; n=4), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (21+/-18; n=7), but the recovery was lower from patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) (13+/-13%; n=6). The haematon fraction was enriched in CD34+ cells (2.5-fold), long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC/CAFC, week 5) (3.5-fold), HPP-CFC (2.8-fold) and GM-CFU (2.3-fold) over the buffy coat. Purified CD34+ cells expanded exponentially and produced 800 to 4000-fold more nucleated cells, 300 to 3500-fold more GM-CFU and 10 to 80-fold more HPP-CFC in stroma-free suspension culture with interleukin-1 (IL-1beta), IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF and stem cell factor (SCF), than did the starting cell input. The haematon fraction produced significantly more progenitor cells than the buffy coat in long-term liquid culture (LTC). This was due to the higher frequency of LTC-IC/CAFC and to the presence of the whole spectrum of native, stroma cell-associated CAFC in haematons.

METHODS: Age-adjusted rates (using the 1970 U.S. standard population) were based on cancer incidence data from NCI and underlying cause of death data compiled by NCHS. The prevalence of tobacco use was derived from CDC surveys. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: From 1990 through 1996, cancer incidence (-0.9% per year; P = .16) and cancer death (-0.6% per year; P = .001) rates for all sites combined decreased. Among the 10 leading cancer incidence sites, statistically significant decreases in incidence rates were seen in males for leukemia and cancers of the lung, colon/rectum, urinary bladder, and oral cavity and pharynx. Except for lung cancer, incidence rates for these cancers also declined in females. Among the 10 leading cancer mortality sites, statistically significant decreases in cancer death rates were seen for cancers of the male lung, female breast, the prostate, male pancreas, and male brain and, for both sexes, cancers of the colon/rectum and stomach. Age-specific analyses of lung cancer revealed that rates in males first declined at younger ages and then for each older age group successively over time; rates in females appeared to be in the early stages of following the same pattern, with rates decreasing for women aged 40-59 years. CONCLUSIONS: The declines in cancer incidence and death rates, particularly for lung cancer, are encouraging. However, unless recent upward trends in smoking among adolescents can be reversed, the lung cancer rates that are currently declining in the United States may rise again.","['Wingo, P A', 'Ries, L A', 'Giovino, G A', 'Miller, D S', 'Rosenberg, H M', 'Shopland, D R', 'Thun, M J', 'Edwards, B K']","['Wingo PA', 'Ries LA', 'Giovino GA', 'Miller DS', 'Rosenberg HM', 'Shopland DR', 'Thun MJ', 'Edwards BK']","['Epidemiology and Surveillance Research Department, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA 30329-4251, USA. pwingo@cancer.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'American Cancer Society', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/epidemiology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/epidemiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/etiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'Smoking/adverse effects/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Smoking Prevention', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/04/28 00:00,1999/04/28 00:01,['1999/04/28 00:00'],"['1999/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/91.8.675 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Apr 21;91(8):675-90. doi: 10.1093/jnci/91.8.675.,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Apr 21;91(8):660-1.

Review of methods and results of epidemiologic studies].",150-8,"BACKGROUND: There are only a few epidemiologic studies investigating risk factors in persons occupationally exposed to high-frequency radiation (e.g. radio-, TV-waves, mobile phones or microwaves). The results of the studies are mostly inconsistent. METHODS: All epidemiologic studies which investigated the association between occupational exposure to high-frequency radiation and the risk of leukemia, brain tumors or breast cancer were included in this review. All studies published between 1980 and 1997, such as record-linkage, case-control, and cohort studies, were retrieved from MEDLINE. Incidence and mortality studies are included. Methodologic problems of these investigations are discussed. RESULTS: Most of the recent epidemiologic studies do not present quantitative exposure data or data on the specific frequencies of electro magnetic fields. In general, the relative risks for leukemia, brain tumors or breast cancer are small, not significant and inconsistent. Confounder variables were not included in most of the analyses and no dose-response relationship was reported. CONCLUSION: To increase the power and the validity of the studies a re-analysis based on original data of all previous studies in this field is recommended. Additionally, to investigate the influence of high-frequency radiation on the development of cancer, international epidemiologic studies are necessary. Only they would have sufficient sample size to detect small elevated risks.","['Blettner, M', 'Schlehofer, B']","['Blettner M', 'Schlehofer B']","['Abteilung Epidemiologie, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg.

Two months after transplantation, 9 of 10 mice developed leukemia and leukemia cells were detected in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM). The main findings at autopsy were peritoneal and pleural effusions and large tumor masses involving the peritoneal organs. However, successful transplantation required injection of a large number of cells. We therefore established a new cell line, ML-2S, from the PB of a mouse with ML-2 leukemia. Although only 2 x 10(6) ML-2S cells were inoculated, ML-2S induced the same pattern of leukemic dissemination reminiscent of the parent ML-2 cells. Compared to ML-2, progression of ML-2S was slow, suggesting that ML-2S is suitable as a leukemia model to study treatment. Furthermore, we confirmed that ML-2S cells are of human origin using isoenzyme analysis and also that ML-2S and ML-2 cells have the same phenotypic character by cell surface marker analysis.","['Arai, C', 'Tsuzaki, Y', 'Arai, N', 'Takeuchi, M', 'Kurimoto, M', 'Nagano, Y']","['Arai C', 'Tsuzaki Y', 'Arai N', 'Takeuchi M', 'Kurimoto M', 'Nagano Y']","['Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories Inc., Nagano Laboratory, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Mice, SCID', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/28 00:00,1999/04/28 00:01,['1999/04/28 00:00'],"['1999/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1999 Jan-Feb;13(1):35-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HGF can modulate the expression of apoptosis-regulatory genes, including bcl-2, bax, and p21WAF1/CIP1 in cell lines, few data address whether HGF regulate the expression of these proteins in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the expression of bcl-2, bax, and p21WAF1/CIP1 in primary samples from patients with AML in the presence and absence of HGF. The potential association of HGF-induced changes in the levels of these proteins with inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was further investigated. RESULTS: While a combination of steel factor (SF) and PIXY321 inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis in 8/11 primary AML samples studied, Bcl-2 and bax protein levels were unaffected by exposure to HGF and/or etoposide. In contrast, HGF enhanced basal and etoposide-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 protein levels in 9/11 and 7/11 of the cases, respectively. In several cases, inhibition of apoptosis by HGF was seen without up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 levels, suggesting that modulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 is not required for HGF-mediated inhibition of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that HGF-mediated inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in primary AML samples is not mediated through changes in Bcl-2, bax, and p21WAF1/CIP1 protein levels.","['DiGiuseppe, J A', 'Kastan, M B', 'Weng, L J', 'Gore, S D']","['DiGiuseppe JA', 'Kastan MB', 'Weng LJ', 'Gore SD']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21287-8963, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA61949/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES0577/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (PIXY321 fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/04/28 00:00,1999/04/28 00:01,['1999/04/28 00:00'],"['1999/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1999 Jan-Feb;13(1):1-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These changes are mediated in part by the induction of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by nonneuronal cells. In the present study, we identified satellite/Schwann cells as a possible source of the injury-induced LIF. Using a Schwann cell line, SC-1 cells, we examined mechanisms of LIF induction. LIF mRNA levels increased rapidly when the cells were treated with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or A23187. Among these reagents, PMA was the most efficacious. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by GF-1 09203X significantly reduced the PMA-induced LIF mRNA levels. As PKC is known to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, the involvement of this pathway in the PMA-stimulated induction of LIF mRNA was examined. Phosphorylation of ERKs was increased following PMA treatment in SC-1 cells. Moreover, inhibition of ERK kinase activity by PD98059 dramatically reduced PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of ERKs and induction of LIF mRNA. These results indicate that LIF mRNA levels can be regulated by ERK activation via stimulation of PKC in Schwann cells.","['Nagamoto-Combs, K', 'Vaccariello, S A', 'Zigmond, R E']","['Nagamoto-Combs K', 'Vaccariello SA', 'Zigmond RE']","['Department of Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],['NS17512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/*metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems/*physiology', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1999/04/27 00:00,1999/04/27 00:01,['1999/04/27 00:00'],"['1999/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.0721871.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1999 May;72(5):1871-81. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.0721871.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The minimal time of follow-up was 24 months. Mortality rate in CR2, leukemic relapse rate and the proportion in continued second remission were 16/75 (21%), 22/75 (29%) and 37/75 (50%), respectively.

Also, there was no difference in outcome between the BMT and the chemotherapy group for children with late relapses.

This process is severely hampered on long 5' UTRs, containing AUGs and secondary structure. These characteristics are often found in mRNAs encoding regulatory proteins like proto-oncogenes, growth factors, their receptors, and homeodomain proteins. A number of these mRNAs use an alternative mechanism of translation initiation, involving an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Cellular mRNAs containing a complex 5' UTR or an IRES share an intriguing characteristic: their translational efficiency can be very specifically regulated by their 5' UTR, providing post-transcriptional regulation. During embryonic development, the 5' UTRs of Antp. Ubx RAR beta 2 c-mos and c-myc regulate protein expression in a spatio-temporal manner. Translation initiation on a number of growth factor RNAs (IGFII, PDGF2, TGF beta, FGF-2, and VEGF) is specifically regulated during differentiation, growth, and stress. Furthermore, 5' UTR activity, mutations in the 5' UTR, or the occurrence of alternative 5' UTRs have been implicated in the progression of various forms of cancer. The mechanisms involved in 5' UTR mediated control are not well understood. Binding of trans-acting factors could mediate translation stimulation or repression. Furthermore, the precise localization of upstream AUGs and the activity of the cap-binding initiation factor 4E are suggested to be important for translation regulation of these mRNAs. This review focuses on 5' UTRs whose activity is regulated, the processes during which this regulation occurs, and as far as known the mechanisms involved.","['van der Velden, A W', 'Thomas, A A']","['van der Velden AW', 'Thomas AA']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Utrecht University, The Netherlands. a.w.vandervelden@bio.uu.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Ubx protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"[""*5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, mos', 'Genes, myc', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Male', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Xenopus/embryology/growth & development']",1999/04/27 00:00,1999/04/27 00:01,['1999/04/27 00:00'],"['1999/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(98)00134-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00134-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1999 Jan;31(1):87-106. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00134-4.,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify RA-responsive genes expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and found that murine folate receptor-alpha (FR-alpha) expression is rapidly induced by RA treatment. The observed increase in FR-alpha expression occurs within 3h, is independent of protein synthesis and does not occur when ES cells are differentiated by removal of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), evidence that the response to RA is both direct and specific. Two messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms of FR-alpha featuring novel sequence in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) were cloned, and both were found to be upregulated by RA. Other splice variants in both the 5' UTR and 3' UTR of FR-alpha mRNA were also identified. There is a striking similarity between these splicing patterns and those reported for human FR-alpha, which also generates multiple isoforms by alternative splicing in the 5' and 3' UTR.

However, their prognostic importance is unclear. In this study, their prognostic significance was analyzed in 201 newly diagnosed patients with de novo AML except acute promyelocytic leukemia. Three patients had mutations in both genes, 43 had only the FLT3 gene mutation, 25 had only the N-RAS gene mutation, and 130 had neither. These mutations seemed to occur independently. Both mutations were related to high peripheral white blood cell counts, and the FLT3 gene mutation was infrequently observed in the French-American-British (FAB)-M2 type. AML cases with wild FLT3/mutant N-RAS had a lower complete remission (CR) rate than those with wild FLT3/wild N-RAS, whereas the presence of mutant FLT3 did not affect the CR rate. Univariate analysis showed that unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival were age 60 years or older (P =.0002), cytogenetic data (P =.002), FAB types other than M2 (P =.002), leukocytosis over 100 +/- 10(9)/L (P =.003), and the FLT3 gene mutation (P =.004). However, the N-RAS gene mutation was only a marginal prognostic factor (P =.06). For the subjects under 60 years old, multivariate analysis showed that the FLT3 gene mutation was the strongest prognostic factor (P =.008) for overall survival. The FLT3 gene mutation, whose presence is detectable only by genomic polymerase chain reaction amplification and gel electrophoresis, might serve as an important molecular marker to predict the prognosis of patients with AML.","['Kiyoi, H', 'Naoe, T', 'Nakano, Y', 'Yokota, S', 'Minami, S', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Asou, N', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Jinnai, I', 'Shimazaki, C', 'Akiyama, H', 'Saito, K', 'Oh, H', 'Motoji, T', 'Omoto, E', 'Saito, H', 'Ohno, R', 'Ueda, R']","['Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T', 'Nakano Y', 'Yokota S', 'Minami S', 'Miyawaki S', 'Asou N', 'Kuriyama K', 'Jinnai I', 'Shimazaki C', 'Akiyama H', 'Saito K', 'Oh H', 'Motoji T', 'Omoto E', 'Saito H', 'Ohno R', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9YVR68W306 (enocitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1999/04/27 00:00,1999/04/27 00:01,['1999/04/27 00:00'],"['1999/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59630-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 May 1;93(9):3074-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In studies of oral 6MP and methotrexate, indices of chronic systemic exposure to active metabolites of these agents, namely, red blood cell (RBC) concentrations of methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs) and thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) have positively correlated with event-free survival (EFS). Our objective was to evaluate whether MTXPGs, TGNs, and the dose intensity of administered methotrexate and 6MP were prognostic in the setting of a treatment protocol in which all treatment was coordinated through a single center, and the weekly doses of methotrexate were given parenterally. On protocol Total XII, 182 children achieved remission and received weekly methotrexate 40 mg/m2 parenterally and daily oral 6MP, interrupted every 6 weeks during the first year by pulse chemotherapy. A total of 709 TGN, 418 MTX-PG, and 267 thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) measurements, along with complete dose intensity information (dose received divided by protocol dose per week) for 19,046 weeks of 6MP and methotrexate, were analyzed. In univariate analyses, only higher dose intensity of 6MP and of weekly methotrexate were significant predictors of overall EFS (P =.006 and. 039, respectively). The occurrence of neutropenia was associated with worse outcome (P =.040). In a multivariate analysis, only higher dose intensity of 6MP (P =.020) was a significant predictor of EFS, with lower TPMT activity (P =.096) tending to associate with better outcome. 6MP dose intensity was also associated (P =.007) with EFS among patients with homozygous wild-type TPMT phenotype. Lower 6MP dose intensity was primarily due to missed weeks of therapy and not to reductions in daily dose. We conclude that increased dose-intensity of oral 6MP is an important determinant of EFS in ALL, particularly among those children with a homozygous wild-type TPMT phenotype. However, increasing intensity of therapy such that neutropenia precludes chemotherapy administration may be counterproductive.","['Relling, M V', 'Hancock, M L', 'Boyett, J M', 'Pui, C H', 'Evans, W E']","['Relling MV', 'Hancock ML', 'Boyett JM', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE']","[""Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hematology/Oncology, and Biostatistics and Epidemiology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methyltransferases/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1999/04/27 00:00,1999/04/27 00:01,['1999/04/27 00:00'],"['1999/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59601-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 May 1;93(9):2817-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate its biological role, we generated transgenic mice expressing E2A-HLF using Ig enhancer and promoter, which direct transgene expression in cells committed to the lymphoid lineage. The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection. The thymus contained small numbers of thymocytes, and TUNEL staining showed that higher population of thymocytes were undergoing apoptosis. The spleen exhibited a marked reduction in splenic lymphocytes and the flow cytometric analyses and the in vitro colony formation assays showed that the B-cell maturation was blocked at a very early developmental stage. These findings indicated that the expression of E2A-HLF induced T-cell apoptosis and B-cell maturation arrest in vivo and that the susceptibility of the transgenic mice to infection was due to immunodeficiency. Moreover, several transgenic mice developed acute leukemia, classified as T-ALL based on the surface marker analysis and DNA rearrangements, suggesting that an additional event is required for malignant transformation of lymphoid cells expressing E2A-HLF. Our findings provide insight into the biological function of E2A-HLF in lymphoid development and also its role in leukemogenesis.","['Honda, H', 'Inaba, T', 'Suzuki, T', 'Oda, H', 'Ebihara, Y', 'Tsuiji, K', 'Nakahata, T', 'Ishikawa, T', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Honda H', 'Inaba T', 'Suzuki T', 'Oda H', 'Ebihara Y', 'Tsuiji K', 'Nakahata T', 'Ishikawa T', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan. hhirai-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adenovirus E2 Proteins)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Hlf protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E2 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/04/27 00:00,1999/04/27 00:01,['1999/04/27 00:00'],"['1999/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59597-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 May 1;93(9):2780-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the leukaemia slowly progressed over a 3-month period, the patient developed four further BCCs.

It has been shown that cells (such as K562) expressing Bcr-Abl/p210, a protein tyrosine kinase, not only undergo cellular transformation but also demonstrate multiple drug resistance. Recent studies also demonstrate that the proteasome is involved in the survival signaling pathway(s). In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the proteasome might play a role in regulating Bcr-Abl function. We have demonstrated by using a variety of inhibitors that inhibition of the proteasome, but not of the cysteine protease, activity is able to activate the apoptotic cell death program in K562 cells. Proteasome inhibition-induced apoptosis is demonstrated by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei, appearance of an apoptotic population with sub-G1 DNA content, the internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and can be blocked by a specific caspase-3-like tetrapeptide inhibitor. Western blot analysis with specific antibodies to c-Abl and Bcr proteins show that treatment of K562 cells with a proteasome inhibitor results in significant reduction of Bcr-Abl protein expression, which occurs several hours before the onset of apoptotic execution. Levels of c-Abl/p145 and Bcr/p160 proteins, however, remain essentially unaltered at that time. Furthermore, reduced Bcr-Abl expression is reflected in significantly attenuated Bcr-Abl-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that proteasome inhibition is sufficient to inactivate Bcr-Abl function and subsequently activate the apoptotic death program in cells that are resistant to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy.","['Dou, Q P', 'McGuire, T F', 'Peng, Y', 'An, B']","['Dou QP', 'McGuire TF', 'Peng Y', 'An B']","['Drug Discovery Program, H.

The purpose of this study was to better understand the pathophysiology of the time evolution of CML relapse and to provide means whereby the outcomes of patients with CML relapse can be projected and treatment modified accordingly. The model consists of three parallel series of catenated compartments representing granulopoiesis in normal (donor) cells from the marrow, in CML cells from the marrow, and in CML cells from extramedullary sites. It was assumed that CML stem cells were resistant to feedback control and that CML-derived neutrophils, as well as normal neutrophils, exercised feedback regulation of normal stem cells. The known longer generation times for CML neutrophil precursors compared with normal neutrophil precursors were used, and it was assumed that 10(7) pluripotential stem cells were infused with BMT. The model was evaluated for its ability to simulate the reappearance of CML (Philadelphia chromosome positive) metaphases in the marrow and the recovery pattern in the blood neutrophil count in six patients who had relapsed following BMT (allogeneic in three patients, allogeneic with T-cell depletion in two patients, and syngeneic in one patient). The variables tested included the site of origin of the CML stem cells responsible for relapse (marrow alone versus marrow and extramedullary sites), the minimum number of CML stem cells responsible for relapse, and the time delay between BMT and the onset of relapse. Model profiles based on the observed values were obtained in each case. The simulations pointed to the fact that relapse began from a small number of CML cells in medullary and extramedullary sites. The time delay between BMT and the onset of relapse varied from 15 to 240 days. We suggest that this biomathematical model should be further investigated as a possible means of predicting outcome and guiding the treatment for patients with CML relapsing after BMT.","['Vincent, P C', 'Rutzen-Loesevitz, L', 'Tibken, B', 'Heinze, B', 'Hofer, E P', 'Fliedner, T M']","['Vincent PC', 'Rutzen-Loesevitz L', 'Tibken B', 'Heinze B', 'Hofer EP', 'Fliedner TM']","['The Kanematsu Laboratories, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.170009 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1999;17(1):9-17. doi: 10.1002/stem.170009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PEL grows exclusively in body cavities as serous lymphomatous effusion without evidence of mass disease or dissemination. The cells are infected with the newly discovered human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), often accompanied by co-infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Several lymphoma cell lines have been established from patients with AIDS- and non-AIDS-associated PEL. Given their phenotypical relationship to plasma cells, several cytokines may be important for growth and survival of PEL cells. We investigated the spectrum of cytokines produced by nine HHV-8+ PEL cell lines, in comparison with five Burkitt lymphoma, seven other B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) and seven multiple myeloma-derived cell lines. In addition, we tested the response of the PEL cells to selected cytokines and the effects of neutralizing anti-cytokine and anti-cytokine receptor antibodies. Using specific ELISAs, PEL cell lines were found to produce large amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6; 10-5000 pg/ml), IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR; 30-600 pg/ml), IL-10 (600-80,000 pg/ml) and oncostatin M (OSM; 50-80 pg/ml) which in most cases were significantly higher than the levels produced by the Burkitt, B-NHL or myeloma cell lines; on the contrary, PEL cell lines did not elaborate significant levels of macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP-1alpha) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, the levels of MIP-1alpha were increased 10- to 100-fold by treatment with phorbol ester TPA. PEL cell lines did not respond proliferatively to IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, LIF, MIP-1alpha, or OSM. Incubation with IL-6sR and IL-6 inhibited cell growth. Anti-IL6 neutralizing antibodies had no effect on PEL cell line proliferation; conversely, whereas anti-IL6R alone inhibited only weakly, anti-gp130 and anti-gp130 plus anti-IL6R showed strong inhibitory effects (>20% inhibition in 5/9 lines and >60% inhibition in 3/9 lines). In summary, PEL cell lines produce high amounts of cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, OSM); proliferation could be inhibited by blocking the receptors of the IL-6 signaling pathway.","['Drexler, H G', 'Meyer, C', 'Gaidano, G', 'Carbone, A']","['Drexler HG', 'Meyer C', 'Gaidano G', 'Carbone A']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/pharmacology/physiology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism/pathology/virology']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401371 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):634-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401371.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome this resistance, we have developed a novel fusion toxin consisting of the catalytic and translocation subunits of diphtheria toxin (DT388) linked to human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In vitro, DT388-GM-CSF demonstrated significant activity against numerous AML cell lines and fresh AML blasts. To determine its in vivo efficacy, we developed an in vivo model of human AML in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice injected intravenously with 1 x 10(7) HL-60 cells (AML-M2 cell line). The SCID mice developed abdominal masses, infiltration of the liver and bone marrow, and peripheral blasts with a median survival of 42.5 days. We tested DT388-GM-CSF, ara-C, human GM-CSF, and DAB389IL-2, which were injected intraperitoneally on days 2-6 in this model. DT3-GM-CSF significantly improved survival of the SCID mice over Ara-C, DAB389IL-2, or control (P < 0.001). DT388-GM-CSF-treated mice who developed leukemia exhibited no difference in the number of GM-CSF receptors (P = 0.39), ligand affinity (P = 0.77), or sensitivity (P = 0.56) to DT388-GM-CSF as compared to the controls. Frank leukemia in DT388-GM-CSF-treated mice may be due to incomplete penetration of drug into tissues rather than cellular resistance. DT388-GM-CSF is an active therapeutic agent in our SCID mouse model of AML with a unique mechanism of action and differing toxicities than current cytotoxic agents.","['Hall, P D', 'Willingham, M C', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Frankel, A E']","['Hall PD', 'Willingham MC', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Frankel AE']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA.']",['eng'],['CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (dt(388) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Diphtheria Toxin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Salvage Therapy']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401357 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):629-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401357.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Engraftment in NOD/SCID mice preconditioned by total body irradiation (TBI) alone was 10-fold higher than in SCID mice preconditioned by macrophage depletion and TBI, demonstrating that NOD/SCID mice are more suitable for engraftment of chronic phase CML cells. Low-density cells at cell doses of 10-30 x 10(6) and purified CD34+ cells at doses of approximately 0.2 x 10(6) engrafted NOD/SCID mice, with levels of 2 to 20% CD45+ cells with production of monocytes, granulocytes, erythroid cells, B-lymphocytes, CD34+ cells and variable frequencies of erythroid and myeloid colony-forming cells. As demonstrated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, purified human myeloid, B-lymphoid, erythroid and CD34+ cells from chimeric mouse BM contained Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph)-positive cells and Ph- cells in similar frequencies as primary cells from the CML patients. These results demonstrate that production of mature normal as well as malignant cells of multiple lineages were supported with similar efficiency. In contrast, all human erythroid and myeloid clonogenic cells detected in the mice were Ph-, which can be attributed to less efficient maintenance or more rapid differentiation of immature Ph+ cells in the mouse microenvironment. CML blast crisis cells also grew well in NOD/SCID mice, with 80-90% of human cells produced containing the Ph- chromosome. The availability of an in vivo assay that supports outgrowth of normal and malignant stem cells from chronic phase and blast crisis CML patients will facilitate examination of differential effects of growth factors, inhibitory cytokines and cytotoxic drugs on survival of normal and malignant stem cells in vivo and on progression of chronic phase CML towards blast crisis.","['Verstegen, M M', 'Cornelissen, J J', 'Terpstra, W', 'Wagemaker, G', 'Wognum, A W']","['Verstegen MM', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Terpstra W', 'Wagemaker G', 'Wognum AW']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401366 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):618-28. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401366.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral transduction with the MFG-EGFP retroviral vector resulted in readily detectable EGFP expression in 27% of human and 11-35% of rhesus monkey bone marrow cells, and in 17-38% of rhesus monkey peripheral blood cells mobilized with FLT3 ligand (FL) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In addition, we used the human CD34+ KG1A cell line as a model to study viability and growth of successfully transduced cells. Cultures of mock- and EGFP-transduced KG1A cells generated equal viable cell numbers for at least 1 month, indicating the absence of a cytotoxic effect of EGFP expression in these cells. FACS selection on the basis of EGFP and CD34 expression resulted in enriched subsets (> or = 87%) of CD34+ EGFP-negative and CD34+ EGFP-positive KG1A, rhesus monkey and human bone marrow cells, demonstrating the potential of obtaining almost pure populations of transduced immature hematopoietic cells. EGFP expression was also readily demonstrated in erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage colonies derived from the CD34+ EGFP-positive rhesus monkey and human bone marrow cells by either inverted fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. Using four-color flow cytometry, EGFP expression could also be demonstrated in viable and phenotypically defined immature subpopulations of the CD34+ cells, ie those expressing little or no HLA-DR (rhesus monkey) or CD38 (human) antigens at the cell surface. These results demonstrate that EGFP is a very useful marker to monitor gene transfer efficiency in phenotypically defined immature rhesus monkey and human hematopoietic cell types and to select for these cells by multicolor flow cytometry prior to transplantation.","['Bierhuizen, M F', 'Westerman, Y', 'Hartong, S C', 'Visser, T P', 'Wognum, A W', 'Wagemaker, G']","['Bierhuizen MF', 'Westerman Y', 'Hartong SC', 'Visser TP', 'Wognum AW', 'Wagemaker G']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Luminescent Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Transfection']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401374 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):605-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401374.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The randomly selected D gene segment of a given VDJ complex can potentially be found in all three possible reading frames (RFs). In the present study, we examined the distribution of D gene RF in 'immature' and 'mature' B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (BCLD). We analyzed the clonotypic VDJ junctional sequences of our previously reported cases of follicular lymphoma (FL), as well as bcl-2/IgH junctions with recognized D elements. A marked under-representation of RF1 was observed, with almost equal usage of RF2 and RF3. A literature search for VDJ published sequences in various BCLD identified a similar pattern of D gene RF usage in multiple myeloma (MM), with marked predilection for RFs 2 and 3. In B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), the pattern of D-RF was 25% for RF1, 46% for RF2 and 29% for RF3, while in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor-B-ALL) all three RFs were used with similar frequencies. The marked under-representation of RF1 in FL and MM clonogenic rearranged D genes suggests selection on the basis of antigenic properties, possibly due to constraints in forming a flexible loop within CDR3. In contrast, the more even distribution of D-RF usage in B-CLL and precursor-B-ALL suggests that, for these disorders, transformation of a immature type B cell repertoire has occurred.","['Stamatopoulos, K', 'Kosmas, C', 'Stavroyianni, N', 'Belessi, C', 'Papadaki, T']","['Stamatopoulos K', 'Kosmas C', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Belessi C', 'Papadaki T']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Athens School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['*Antibody Diversity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Open Reading Frames', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401396 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):601-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401396.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activities of PP1 and PP2A of AML blasts correlated positively with the expression of CD11b, whereas activities of PP1 and PP2B correlated negatively with the expression of CD7. Thus, each phosphatase was ubiquitously but differently expressed in various leukemic cell types and in normal leukocytes.

In our previous studies, we demonstrated that mRNA expression of the hematopoiesis-specific G protein alpha-subunit G alpha16 is a sensitive marker indicating the appearance of early myeloid and lymphoid progenitors. This study was designed to investigate cytokine effects on hematopoiesis in vivo and in vitro as reflected by G alpha16 expression and sensitivity to the hemoregulatory peptide (pEEDCK)2 which harbors a structural homology to the effector domain of G alpha16. Investigations on blood samples from lymphoma patients undergoing salvage therapy with different cytokine support showed that monitoring of the expression of G alpha16 mRNA which appears to play a role in cytokine signalling via tyrosine kinases was a valuable complementation to CD34 screening for analyzing hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy. We demonstrated that in contrast to CD34 which is only expressed in quiescent cells, G alpha16 transcription occurs independently of cell cycle state. In vitro, we could show that G alpha16 was also a valuable marker for confirming the immature state of ex vivo expanded blood stem cells from patients. A further part of the study was focused on the response of G alpha16 and CD34 expressing cells to the granulocyte-derived hemoregulatory peptide (pyroGlu-Glu-Asp-Cys-Lys)2 = (pEEDCK)2 which harbors a G alpha16-homologous sequence motif. Results obtained from in vitro assays which involved estimation of colony outgrowth from CD34-positive cells showed that the effect of (pEEDCK)2 on CD34 cells enhanced the effect of IL-3 or SCF.

Constitutive activation of MAP kinase has been observed in a variety of solid tumors including renal cancer and breast cancer. Recently, we have reported that constitutively activated MAP kinase was observed in 50% of human primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Ras is one of the components of G-proteins and transduces the signal from cytokine receptors to raf-1 theoretically resulting in the activation of MAP kinase pathway. In the present study, we have examined the correlation of Ras mutations and the activation of MAP kinase pathway in patients with AML. Twenty out of 22 AML cases with activating N-Ras mutations showed no phosphorylated forms of ERK2. ERK2 phosphorylation was tightly correlated with ERK1 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activity detected by in vitro kinase assay. Three samples with N-Ras mutations were stimulated with IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF separately but ERK2 activation was induced in none of these samples stimulated with these cytokines. In contrast, ERK2 was constitutively activated in all of four pancreatic carcinoma cases with K-Ras mutation at codon 12. These results suggest that function of the Ras mutations may be different between solid tumors, such as pancreatic carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma, and AML. Mutated Ras does not always stimulate MAP kinase pathway constitutively and may rather inhibit classical MAP kinase cascade in AML blasts from leukemia patients.","['Iida, M', 'Towatari, M', 'Nakao, A', 'Iida, H', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Nakano, Y', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Saito, H', 'Naoe, T']","['Iida M', 'Towatari M', 'Nakao A', 'Iida H', 'Kiyoi H', 'Nakano Y', 'Tanimoto M', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Genes, ras', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Point Mutation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401369 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):585-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One limitation of this approach in B-precursor ALL is that leukemic phenotypes are often qualitatively similar to normal marrow B progenitors, though it has long been recognized that the latter show a predictable pattern of antigen expression with differentiation. In this study we used four-color flow cytometry to define precisely the patterns of normal antigen expression on a series of normal bone marrows using two different four-color combinations of antibodies: CD19-APC/CD45-perCP/CD20-PE/CD10-FITC; and CD19-APC/CD45-perCP/CD9-PE/CD34-FITC. A series of dual parameter displays were created in which normal B precursors occupied predictable regions. We then tested these antibody combinations on a series of 82 cases of B-precursor ALL and found that in 76/82 cases (93%) the first combination demonstrated an abnormal population on at least one of the dual parameter displays, and that 72/77 cases tested (94%) showed an abnormality with the second combination. When taken together, 81/82 cases (99%) showed an abnormality. When purified blasts were serially diluted into normal marrows we found a sensitivity of detection of 1 cell in 10(4) normal marrow cells provided sufficient CD19+ cells were acquired to visualize the abnormal population as a discrete cluster. Because the pattern of antigen expression in normals is very reproducible, it is possible to create a fixed set of geometrical regions to define the normal; this makes analysis of an unknown sample very straightforward. We conclude that our approach could be employed as a simple method for the detection of minimal residual disease in B-precursor ALL, and unlike many other methods should prove applicable to virtually all cases of this malignancy.","['Weir, E G', 'Cowan, K', 'LeBeau, P', 'Borowitz, M J']","['Weir EG', 'Cowan K', 'LeBeau P', 'Borowitz MJ']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore MD 21287, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401364 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):558-67. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401364.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several clinical trials have attempted to reverse cytopenia by using hematopoietic growth factors (HGF), success has been limited due in part to a limited understanding of the role of HGF in MDS progression. The FLT3 ligand, which binds to and activates the FLT3 receptor, does not have a stimulatory effect on hematopoietic cells, but can synergize with other HGF to support the expansion of both immature and committed progenitors. Using ELISA technology we measured endogenous serum levels in 93 patients with MDS: 29 RA, 1 RARS, 31 RAEB, 23 RAEBt, 9 CMML. 48.3% of RA patients' sera had significantly elevated FLT3 ligand levels ranging from 404 to 5735 pg/ml, whereas none of the RAEB, RAEBt, or CMML patients sera had levels different from controls. No significant correlation was found between FLT3 ligand levels and peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, age, cytogenetic abnormalities, or survival. Our data suggest that FLT3 ligand levels can be upregulated early in the course of MDS, which may represent an appropriate response to a decreased number of normal progenitors, or alternatively a dysregulated HGF system.","['Zwierzina, H', 'Anderson, J E', 'Rollinger-Holzinger, I', 'Torok-Storb, B', 'Nuessler, V', 'Lyman, S D']","['Zwierzina H', 'Anderson JE', 'Rollinger-Holzinger I', 'Torok-Storb B', 'Nuessler V', 'Lyman SD']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401378 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):553-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its detection has been primarily done by karyotype analysis of bone marrow cells. The major limitation of the karyotypic technique is an absolute need for metaphases, often difficult to obtain in an appropriate number in patients under therapy. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a sensitive and quantitative method to detect the bcr/abl fusion gene in cells in both metaphase and interphase. Using M-bcr and abl probes, we performed the interphase FISH in the peripheral blood of 30 healthy volunteers and in 20 hematologically normal bone marrow samples. False-positive cells were detected in 2.7 +/- 0.7% (mean +/- standard deviation) and 2.3 +/- 0.7% among 500 cells, respectively. Then we tested 31 patients with CML at various stages of disease on 50 occasions. Although there was a good correlation between the percentage of FISH-positive cells in the peripheral blood and that in the bone marrow (r = 0.977), between the percentage of FISH-positive cells in the peripheral blood and that of Ph chromosome in the bone marrow (r = 0.841), and between the percentage of FISH-positive cells and that of Ph chromosome in the bone marrow (r = 0.933), the limits of agreement in each group were not small, and thus the peripheral blood FISH test can not be interpreted as the same method with conventional karyotyping. Additionally, we could easily rule out CML in 15 individuals with leukocytosis without performing bone marrow aspiration. The present study indicates that FISH analysis in the peripheral blood is a simple and reliably sensitive test for the detection and quantitative monitoring of the M-bcr/abl fusion gene in CML in routine clinical practice, although this can not entirely replace karyotype analysis of bone marrow cells.","['Yanagi, M', 'Shinjo, K', 'Takeshita, A', 'Tobita, T', 'Yano, K', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Terasaki, H', 'Naoe, T', 'Ohnishi, K', 'Ohno, R']","['Yanagi M', 'Shinjo K', 'Takeshita A', 'Tobita T', 'Yano K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Terasaki H', 'Naoe T', 'Ohnishi K', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blood Cells/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocytosis/blood/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Neutrophils/chemistry', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401383 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):542-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401383.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsatellite regions in the type II transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGF-beta RII) gene appear to be targets for mutation in some cancers displaying microsatellite instability (replication error phenotype, RER+). Furthermore, TGF-beta RII mutations in RER+ tumors have been associated with decreased TGF-beta RII mRNA levels. As TGF-beta is a potent negative growth regulator of hematopoietic cells, investigations were undertaken to determine whether inactivation of the receptor by microsatellite alteration might be involved in the progression of CML. Analysis of TGF-beta RII mRNA expression by RNase protection, with comparison of cells from the chronic, accelerated and blast phases of CML, showed no change in TGF-beta RII transcript levels during disease progression. However, during each phase of the disease, low levels of TGF-beta RII were detected when compared with the hematopoietic cells of normal donors. Furthermore, this decreased expression was also observed in the other myeloproliferative disorders, polycythemia rubra vera (PRV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60 had no detectable TGF-beta RII mRNA. Two microsatellite regions found altered in RER+ colon cancers were analyzed to establish if these sequences were aberrant in CML. No alteration was detected in either of these regions in any phase of the disease. These results suggest that alterations of the microsatellite regions in the TGF-beta RII gene are not involved in the progression of CML. Decreased expression of TGF-beta RII in CML cells and leukemia cell lines raises the possibility that altered expression of the receptor may play a role in the initiation and/or maintenance of the disease state.","['Rooke, H M', 'Vitas, M R', 'Crosier, P S', 'Crosier, K E']","['Rooke HM', 'Vitas MR', 'Crosier PS', 'Crosier KE']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,"['*Base Pair Mismatch', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/pathology', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401384 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):535-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401384.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In earlier studies we showed a lineage-specific methylation pattern of the M-CSF receptor gene c-fms in blood monocytes and tissue macrophages. Here, we provide evidence that a lineage-specific hypomethylation exists for the G-CSF receptor gene for myelomonocytic cells but not in lymphocytes without any interindividual differences. Constant differences were found between alveolar and peritoneal macrophages with a lesser degree of methylation in peritoneal macrophages. Acute myelomonocytic leukemias showed an increased methylation as compared with normal granulocytes and monocytes. All permanent cell lines analyzed revealed hypermethylation of the G-CSF receptor gene. Lymphocytes of B-CLL showed a strong hypermethylation of this gene. Increased methylation has been shown to be inversely correlated with transcriptional gene activities.

Forty-two of the 83 patients aged 55 years or less included in the trial (51%) achieved CR. Three were allografted in CR. Twenty-four of the remaining 39 patients who achieved CR (62%) received ABMT (16 patients) or autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APSCT) (eight patients). Indeed, as bone marrow harvest was often insufficient, APSCT was subsequently proposed after mobilization by consolidation chemotherapy followed by G-CSF. The conditioning regimen combined cyclophosphamide and busulfan. ABMT and APSCT were performed 1-7 months (median 3) after CR achievement. Hematological reconstitution occurred in all patients and tended to be faster after APSCT than ABMT although not significantly. Three patients died from the procedure, nine relapsed after 2-26 months and 12 (50%) were still in CR after 8-55 months. In autografted patients, median Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival and survival were 29 and 33 months from the autograft, respectively. Thus, ABMT or APSCT can be performed in almost two-thirds of MDS patients who achieve CR with intensive chemotherapy. PBSC collection may yield higher numbers of stem cells than marrow collection in some cases, and could improve the percentage of MDS patients autografted in CR.

In the event of any complication they referred to the Emergency Unit (EU) of our Department dedicated to outpatients with hematologic diseases. Forty patients with APL observed over a 4 year period were eligible for intensive chemotherapy. After the achievement of complete remission they received a total of 104 consolidation courses and in 98 instances they were followed on an ambulatory basis. There were 41 cases (42%) of rehospitalization for fever (40 cases) or severe anemia (one case). Only one patient died due to a brain hemorrhage. Streptococcus viridans was the organism most frequently isolated from blood. Empiric once-a-day antibacterial therapy with ceftriaxone and amikacin was effective in 87% of the cases and made possible early discharge in 28% of the cases to continue the antibiotic therapy on an outpatient setting. Patients were managed out of the hospital for 76% of the post-consolidation neutropenia period.

The ras mutation frequency varies between 95% in pancreatic cancer and 5% in breast cancer. In leukemia, the highest frequency (30%) is found in acute myeloid leukemia. The presence of ras mutations has been correlated with a poor prognosis and negative clinical outcome. This suggests that mutated Ras activates mechanisms, which favor tumor growth, enhance the metastatic capacity of tumors or modulate tumor-specific immune responses. Several new functions of Ras, such as downregulation of major histocompatibility complex molecules, upregulation of certain cytokines, growth factors and degradative enzymes have been uncovered in the last decade. Additionally, mutated Ras can also serve as a primary target for the development of immunotherapy or drug therapy. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which Ras expressing tumors are able to evade destruction by the immune system and enhance their growth and metastatic potential. It will further elaborate on the attempts to develop successful immunotherapy and drug therapy targeting Ras expressing tumors.","['Weijzen, S', 'Velders, M P', 'Kast, W M']","['Weijzen S', 'Velders MP', 'Kast WM']","['Cancer Immunology Program, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA/AI78399-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOS1 Protein)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Fungal Proteins/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', '*Genes, ras', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*metabolism', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Reoviridae Infections/physiopathology', 'Repressor Proteins/physiology', 'SOS1 Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401367 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Apr;13(4):502-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401367.,,107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognostic relevance of 13q14 abnormalities as detected by FISH is unknown. We prospectively studied malignant blood cells from 54 consecutive, untreated B-CLL patients using FISH probes to the RB1 locus and DBM (markers D13S25 and D13S319) for band 13q14, as well as probes to chromosome 12. The cells from all cases were CD5+ CD20+, expressed clonally restricted surface immunoglobulin light chain, and had typical features for B-CLL on careful blood smear morphologic evaluation. Patients were followed for a mean of 3.9 years and treatment-free survival (TFS) was used in the prognostic factor analysis. Twenty-four (44%) patients were observed to have monosomy of the RB1 locus and 26 (48%) monosomy of D13S25 and D13S319. The 26 patients who had a deletion at at least one of these loci had a 48.4 month (mo) median TFS vs 31.1 mo for those without evidence of deletion at any 13q14 locus (p = 0.07). The seven patients found to have trisomy 12 had a median TFS of 6.9 mo vs 39.3 mo for those diploid for chromosome 12 (p < 0.01). When these seven patients with trisomy 12 were excluded from the analysis, patients who had a deletion at 13q14 tended to have a longer median TFS (50.1 vs 36.2 mos), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.2). This study confirms the prevalence of 13q14 deletions in B-CLL and suggests that patients with this abnormality have a better TFS than those with trisomy 12.","['Hogan, W J', 'Tefferi, A', 'Borell, T J', 'Jenkins, R', 'Li, C Y', 'Witzig, T E']","['Hogan WJ', 'Tefferi A', 'Borell TJ', 'Jenkins R', 'Li CY', 'Witzig TE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1999/04/24 00:00,1999/04/24 00:01,['1999/04/24 00:00'],"['1999/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898002076 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00207-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Apr 15;110(2):77-81. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00207-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported previously that wild-type C-1300 murine neuroblastoma (wMNB) cells, made resistant to the nucleoside analogue (Z)-5'-fluoro-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxyadenosine (MDL 28,842), an irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1), express increased AdoMet synthetase activity (M. R. Hamre et al., Oncol. Res., 7: 487-492, 1995). In the present study, immunoblot analyses of AdoMet Synthetase with isoform-specific (MATII) antibodies demonstrated an elevation in the AdoMet synthetase immunoprotein in nucleoside analogue-resistant MNB cells (rMNB-MDL) when compared to wild-type, nonresistant MNB cells. An increase of 2.1-fold was observed in the alpha2/alpha2' catalytic subunit, which differed significantly from the much smaller increment in the noncatalytic beta-subunit of AdoMet synthetase. Densitometric analyses revealed that an increased expression of AdoMet synthetase in rMNB-MDL cells was due to overexpression of the alpha2 (Mr 53,000; 2.6-fold) and alpha2' (Mr 51,000; 1.8-fold) subunits. AdoMet synthetase mRNA expression in rMNB-MDL cells was remarkably greater than wMNB cells, as determined by quantitative competitive reverse transcription-PCR (QC-PCR) analysis. DNA (cytosine) methyl transferase expression, measured by reverse transcription-PCR analysis, was also elevated significantly in rMNB-MDL cells. In contrast, Western blot analyses demonstrated down-regulation (1.6-fold) of AdoMet synthetase in doxorubicin-resistant human leukemia cells (HL-60-R) expressing multidrug resistance protein when compared with wild-type, nonresistant HL-60 cells. The resistance of rMNB-MDL cells to nucleoside analogue inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase correlates directly with overexpression of the alpha2/alpha2' subunits of AdoMet synthetase. Cellular adaptation allows sufficient AdoMet to be synthesized, so that viability of the MNB cells can be maintained even in the presence of high AdoHcy concentrations. This novel mechanism of drug resistance does not appear to require multidrug resistance protein (P-glycoprotein) overexpression.","['Dwivedi, R S', 'Wang, L J', 'Mirkin, B L']","['Dwivedi RS', 'Wang LJ', 'Mirkin BL']","[""Children's Memorial Institute for Education and Research, Children's Memorial Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois 60614, USA. ramaa@nwu.edu""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', ""122289-05-8 (4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine)"", 'EC 2.5.1.6 (Methionine Adenosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/23 00:00,1999/04/23 00:01,['1999/04/23 00:00'],"['1999/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Apr 15;59(8):1852-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together, the level of PSA and the rva formed a two-variable model for survival time that worked at any time during the course of HRPC. Here, we have added serial measurements of hemoglobin and weight to test whether they improve the prior model based on PSA alone. Data from two Cancer and Leukemia Group B studies (9181 and 9182) on HRPC were combined to study the relationship between survival and serial measurements of PSA, serum hemoglobin, and patient weight. Altogether, there were 348 patients who could be evaluated. We used the Cox proportional hazard model for survival time with the interval censored method to accommodate time-dependent covariates, and tests for significance were two sided. Log (PSA), rva, log (hemoglobin), and log [weight (in kg)] were all significantly related to survival time during the course of HRPC (P < 3.0 x 10(-5)). Together, they formed a prognostic score based upon the relative hazard. Higher values of this score implied higher probability of death as the next observed event. Serial measurements of PSA, hemoglobin, and weight provide a prognostic score that can be applied continuously during the course of HRPC. Changes in the score may provide a reproducible measure of treatment effect.","['Vollmer, R T', 'Kantoff, P W', 'Dawson, N A', 'Vogelzang, N J']","['Vollmer RT', 'Kantoff PW', 'Dawson NA', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Laboratory Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Body Weight', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/23 00:00,1999/04/23 00:01,['1999/04/23 00:00'],"['1999/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Apr;5(4):831-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EURELEX program was first applied in Italy to a cohort of geothermal workers in Larderello, Tuscany. METHODS: The cohort mortality study comprised 4,237 men who had worked at the geothermal power plant between 1950 and 1990. Vital status and death certificates were obtained from registration offices in the municipality of birth or death. Particular attention was paid to neoplastic effects of exposure to asbestos, largely used in the past for pipeline insulating purposes. The matrix allowed the workers to be subdivided into several categories according to estimated absestos exposure. Smoking information was not available. RESULTS: No excess mortality was found for all causes and total cancer mortality. A small excess of pleural cancer (2 obs. vs. 1.4 exp.) was not statistically significant. The effect of other agents included in the matrix was also examined: the small excess of leukemia among those exposed to solvents prior to 1963 (year of benzene ban in Italy) did not reach the level of statistical significance. No cases of leukemia were found among the workers presumed to have been exposed to important ELF electromagnetic fields. CONCLUSION: The study provides reassuring information on a large cohort of a unique geothermal power plant since no significant excess mortality for asbestos related cancers was observed. Furthermore, it represents a useful application and validation of a comprehensive job-exposure matrix for the electric industry in Europe.","['Pira, E', 'Turbiglio, M', 'Maroni, M', 'Carrer, P', 'La Vecchia, C', 'Negri, E', 'Iachetta, R']","['Pira E', 'Turbiglio M', 'Maroni M', 'Carrer P', 'La Vecchia C', 'Negri E', 'Iachetta R']","[""Dipartimento di Traumatologia, Ortopedia e Medicina del Lavoro dell'Universita di Torino, Turin, Italy.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Solvents)', '1332-21-4 (Asbestos)']",IM,"['Asbestos/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Death Certificates', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pleural Neoplasms/mortality', '*Power Plants', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Solvents/adverse effects']",1999/04/23 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/23 02:02'],"['1999/04/23 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/23 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199905)35:5<536::AID-AJIM12>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199905)35:5<536::aid-ajim12>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1999 May;35(5):536-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199905)35:5<536::aid-ajim12>3.0.co;2-g.,,,['Am J Ind Med. 2001 Apr;39(4):436-7; author reply 438.

However, the present methods, schedules of administration and combinations have often been derived form historical precedent rather than from pharmacological knowledge. For many drugs, paediatric phase I and II studies have never been performed and reliance on adult studies will be inadequate as children may show differences in drug disposition or susceptibility to toxicity. In this review, we examine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies as they relate to the treatment of a 'model' childhood cancer in the UK: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Each of the drugs used is examined in the light of pharmacological evidence. For the drugs L-asparaginase, methotrexate, cytarabine and the thiopurines, this evidence suggests that the current use of these drugs is not optimal and that significant improvements in cure for ALL might be achieved by pharmacologically guiding their use. We highlight an important recent study demonstrating a 10% increase in long-term survival in childhood ALL by the use of pharmacologically guided dosing compared to standard (by body surface area) dosing. Since significant improvements in survival may depend upon such effective use, we suggest that pharmacological studies become an integral part of phase II and phase III trials of treatments for childhood cancer.","['Burke, G A', 'Estlin, E J', 'Lowis, S P']","['Burke GA', 'Estlin EJ', 'Lowis SP']",['Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children.'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Prodrugs)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Child', '*Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Patient Care Planning', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",1999/04/23 00:00,1999/04/23 00:01,['1999/04/23 00:00'],"['1999/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0305-7372(98)90098-6 [pii]', '10.1053/CTRV.1998.0098 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 1999 Feb;25(1):13-27. doi: 10.1053/CTRV.1998.0098.,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fibroblasts genetically modified to produce high amounts of LIF were grafted to the injured spinal cords of adult Fischer 344 rats. Two weeks after injury, animals with LIF-secreting cells showed a specific and significant increase in corticospinal axon growth compared with control animals. Furthermore, expression of neurotrophin-3, but not nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or ciliary neurotrophic factor, was increased at the lesion site in LIF-grafted but not in control subjects. No differences in astroglial and microglial/macrophage activation were observed. Thus, LIF can directly or indirectly modulate molecular and cellular responses of the adult CNS to injury.

This required the presence of either phorbol 12-myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin or PMA plus the viral protein HTLV-I Tax1. By mutation studies, it could be shown that Ets1 and Ets2 exerted their effects on the IL-5 promoter through a GGAA motif within the Cle0 element. In myeloid Kasumi cells, Ets1 and Ets2 failed to stimulate IL-5 promoter activity, unless the T-cell specific transcription factor GATA3 was added. These results show, for the first time, that Ets1 and Ets2 are able to cooperate with GATA3. Both ionomycin and Tax1 increased the combined effect of GATA3 with Ets1 and Ets2 in the presence of PMA. The data further demonstrate that, in addition to Ets1, Ets2 is also able to functionally cooperate with Tax1. The synergism of GATA3 with either Ets1 or Ets2 may play an important role in calcium- or Tax1-dependent regulation of IL-5 expression in Th2 cells or in HTLV-I transformed adult T-cell leukemia cells, respectively.","['Blumenthal, S G', 'Aichele, G', 'Wirth, T', 'Czernilofsky, A P', 'Nordheim, A', 'Dittmer, J']","['Blumenthal SG', 'Aichele G', 'Wirth T', 'Czernilofsky AP', 'Nordheim A', 'Dittmer J']","['Institut fur Zellbiologie, Abteilung Molekularbiologie, Universitat Tubingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/*genetics', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",1999/04/23 00:00,1999/04/23 00:01,['1999/04/23 00:00'],"['1999/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.18.12910 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73436-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 30;274(18):12910-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.18.12910.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The G protein alpha-subunit Galpha16, which is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, is highly regulated during differentiation of normal and leukemic cells. In human erythroleukemia cells, suppression of Galpha16 inhibited cellular growth rates. A reporter gene system was established to assess the role of Galpha16 on erythroid differentiation of MB-02 erythroleukemia cells. It is based on transient transfection with a plasmid that expresses green fluorescent protein under the control of the beta-globin promoter. Expression of Galpha16 led to a significant increase in green fluorescent protein-positive cells, as did transfection with a Galpha16 antisense plasmid (154 and 156% of controls, respectively). The GTPase-deficient, constitutively active mutant of Galpha16, Galpha16R186C, further stimulated differentiation to 195% of control values. Because the effect of Galpha16 is triggered most efficiently by the GTP-bound protein, an indirect action through interference of overexpressed Galpha16 with G protein betagamma-subunits can be excluded. The corresponding mutant of Galphaq (GalphaqR182C), the phylogenetically closest family member of Galpha16, had no effect. The data define a specific role for Galpha16-dependent signal transduction in cellular differentiation: deviations from optimal levels of Galpha16 functional activity lead to reduced growth rates and promote differentiation in hematopoietic cells.","['Ghose, S', 'Porzig, H', 'Baltensperger, K']","['Ghose S', 'Porzig H', 'Baltensperger K']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Postfach 51, Friedbuhlstrasse 49, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Antisense)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Antisense/pharmacology']",1999/04/23 00:00,1999/04/23 00:01,['1999/04/23 00:00'],"['1999/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.18.12848 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73427-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 30;274(18):12848-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.18.12848.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of gp130 by leukemia inhibitory factor is sufficient to induce myocardial cell hypertrophy accompanied by specific changes in the pattern of gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms that link gp130 activation to these changes have not been clarified. The present study investigated the transcriptional pathways by which leukemia inhibitory factor activates beta-myosin heavy chain expression during myocardial cell hypertrophy. Mutation of the GATA motif in the beta-myosin heavy chain promoter totally abolished leukemia inhibitory factor-responsive transcription without changing basal transcriptional activity. In contrast, endothelin-1 responsiveness was unaffected by the GATA mutation. Among members of the cardiac GATA transcription factor subfamily (GATA-4, -5, and -6), GATA-5 was the sole and potent transactivator for the beta-myosin heavy chain promoter. This transactivation was dependent on sequence-specific binding of GATA-5 to the beta-myosin heavy chain GATA element. Cardiac nuclear factors that bind to to the beta-myosin heavy chain GATA element were induced by leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation. Last, leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation markedly increased transcripts of cardiac GATA-5, the expression of which is normally restricted to the early embryo. Thus, GATA-5 may be involved in gp130 signaling in cardiac myocytes.","['Morimoto, T', 'Hasegawa, K', 'Kaburagi, S', 'Kakita, T', 'Masutani, H', 'Kitsis, R N', 'Matsumori, A', 'Sasayama, S']","['Morimoto T', 'Hasegawa K', 'Kaburagi S', 'Kakita T', 'Masutani H', 'Kitsis RN', 'Matsumori A', 'Sasayama S']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata5 protein, rat)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'GATA5 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1999/04/23 00:00,1999/04/23 00:01,['1999/04/23 00:00'],"['1999/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.18.12811 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73422-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 30;274(18):12811-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.18.12811.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyzed Sp100 domains that determine its subcellular localization, dimerization, and SUMOylation. A functional nuclear localization signal and an ND-targeting region that coincides with an Sp100 homodimerization domain were mapped. Sequences similar to the Sp100 homodimerization/ND-targeting region occur in several other proteins and constitute a novel protein motif, termed HSR domain. The lysine residue of the Sp100 protein, to which SUMO-1 is covalently linked, was mapped within and may therefore modulate the previously described HP1 protein-binding site. A consensus sequence for SUMOylation of proteins in general is suggested. SUMOylation strictly depended on a functional nuclear localization signal but was not necessary for nuclear import or ND targeting. A three-dimensional structure of Sp100, which supports the mapping data and provides additional information on Sp100 structure/function relationships, was generated by computer modeling. Taken together, our studies indicate the existence of well defined Sp100 domains with functions in ND targeting, nuclear import, nuclear SUMOylation, and protein-protein interaction.","['Sternsdorf, T', 'Jensen, K', 'Reich, B', 'Will, H']","['Sternsdorf T', 'Jensen K', 'Reich B', 'Will H']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie an der Universitat Hamburg, Martinistrasse 52, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Dimerization', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Subcellular Fractions/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/*chemistry']",1999/04/23 00:00,1999/04/23 00:01,['1999/04/23 00:00'],"['1999/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.18.12555 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73389-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 30;274(18):12555-66. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.18.12555.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a new clone of these cells, P388D1/MAB, selected on the basis of high responsivity to lipopolysaccharide plus platelet-activating factor, was studied, delayed PGE2 production (6-24 h) in response to lipopolysaccharide alone occurred in parallel with the induction of Group V sPLA2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). No changes in the level of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) or COX-1 were observed, and Group IIA sPLA2 was not detectable. Use of a potent and selective sPLA2 inhibitor, 3-(3-acetamide 1-benzyl-2-ethylindolyl-5-oxy)propanesulfonic acid (LY311727), and an antisense oligonucleotide specific for Group V sPLA2 revealed that delayed PGE2 was largely dependent on the induction of Group V sPLA2. Also, COX-2, not COX-1, was found to mediate delayed PGE2 production because the response was completely blocked by the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. Delayed PGE2 production and Group V sPLA2 expression were also found to be blunted by the inhibitor methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate. Because inhibition of Ca2+-independent PLA2 by an antisense technique did not have any effect on the arachidonic acid release, the data using methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate suggest a key role for the cPLA2 in the response as well. Collectively, the results suggest a model whereby cPLA2 activation regulates Group V sPLA2 expression, which in turn is responsible for delayed PGE2 production via COX-2.","['Shinohara, H', 'Balboa, M A', 'Johnson, C A', 'Balsinde, J', 'Dennis, E A']","['Shinohara H', 'Balboa MA', 'Johnson CA', 'Balsinde J', 'Dennis EA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Medicine and Revelle College, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0601, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM 20501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 26171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytosol/*enzymology', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Prostaglandins/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/23 02:02,2000/02/19 09:00,['1999/04/23 02:02'],"['1999/04/23 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/23 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.18.12263 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73349-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 30;274(18):12263-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.18.12263.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has previously been shown that 55K associates with Orf6. Here we show that 55K also associates with Orf3 and that this interaction is necessary for 55K to localize to the nuclear matrix fraction of the cell. From our data, we infer that the Orf3 and Orf6 interactions with 55K may be mutually exclusive. The Orf3 protein is also known to associate with and cause the reorganization of cell nucleus structures known as ND10 or PODs. Consistent with the observed increase in the biochemical interaction between 55K and Orf3 in the absence of Orf6, the 55K association with Orf3 in ND10 was also found to increase in the absence of Orf6. The most studied cellular component of ND10 is PML, a complex protein present in a range of isoforms, some of which are modified by conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like protein PIC-1. The pattern of PML isoforms was altered in adenovirus-infected cells, in that a number of additional isoform bands appeared in an Orf3-dependent manner, one of which became predominant later in infection. As for ND10 reorganization, neither Orf6 nor 55K was required for this effect. Therefore it is likely that these changes in PML are related to the changes in ND10 structure that occur during infection.","['Leppard, K N', 'Everett, R D']","['Leppard KN', 'Everett RD']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Adenovirus Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenovirus Early Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nuclear Matrix/virology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/04/22 00:00,1999/04/22 00:01,['1999/04/22 00:00'],"['1999/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-80-4-997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1999 Apr;80 ( Pt 4):997-1008. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-80-4-997.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-80-4-997 [doi],,,,

Based on the strategy of fractionating the total radiation dose, trials were designed to define the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of a series of doses of 131I-Lym-1 given 2-6 weeks apart. All patients had disease resistant to standard therapy. 131I-Lym-1 was given after unconjugated Lym-1 and the 131I dose was escalated in Phase I-II trials. Therapy proved safe. The dose-limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia. Nonhematological toxicities did not exceed grade 2 except for infrequent instances of grade 3 hypotension. In a low-dose (LD) trial of 131I-Lym-1, tumor regression occurred in 25 (83%) of 30 patients and 17 (57 %) had durable remissions; 3 of the remissions were complete. In a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) trial of 131I-Lym-1, 10 (71%) of 14 entries that received at least two doses of 131I-Lym-1 therapy and 11 (52%) of 21 total entries had remissions; 7 of the remissions were complete. All 3 entries in the MTD cohort of 100 mCi/m2 [3.7 MBq/m2] of body surface area had durable complete remissions. Therapeutic remission and human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) after Lym-1 therapy were associated with increased survival that was significant in multivariate analyses. Evidence for an Ab3 idiotypic network with an antibody cytotoxic for Raji human lymphoma was found in the only patient examined in detail thus far; this patient was studied because she had a high titer, HAMA and prolonged survival. In conclusion, 131I-Lym-1 induced durable remissions in patients with chemotherapy-resistant NHL or CLL and was associated with acceptable toxicity. In a subset of the patients, survival was quite prolonged perhaps related to development of Ab3.","['DeNardo, G L', ""O'Donnell, R T"", 'Rose, L M', 'Mirick, G R', 'Kroger, L A', 'DeNardo, S J']","['DeNardo GL', ""O'Donnell RT"", 'Rose LM', 'Mirick GR', 'Kroger LA', 'DeNardo SJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento 95816, USA.']",['eng'],['PHS CA 47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunotherapy']",1999/04/22 00:00,1999/04/22 00:01,['1999/04/22 00:00'],"['1999/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hyb.1999.18.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybridoma. 1999 Feb;18(1):1-11. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1999.18.1.,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the probability of obtaining another response with this drug in patients who relapsed after 2-CdA treatment will be addressed. Forty-two consecutive patients (32 men, 10 women) with a median age of 56 years (range 32-75) at the time of initiation of 2-CdA treatment were analyzed. Ten patients were pretreated with either splenectomy (n=6) or interferon a (n=8) or deoxycoformycin (dCF) (n=3) or with all procedures in sequence. Two patients who did not respond to dCF did respond to 2-CdA. Median time to start of 2-CdA treatment of the ten pretreated patients was 47 months (10-160); 41 of the 42 (98%) achieved CR, and one patient reached a good partial response with a single cycle of 2-CdA. Ten of the 42 patients had no toxicities at all. Toxicities (WHO grades I-IV) were mainly of grades I and II; in one patient with a preexisting brain injury grade III neurotoxicity was seen, and one patient suffered a grade-IV infectious complication. Bone marrow biopsies were performed at the time of recovery of hematopoiesis, thereafter at 2- to 3-month intervals, then at 6 months, and finally annually in all 42 patients. Median follow-up is 32 months (2-72). Disease-free survival from start of 2-CdA treatment is 75% at 6 years; 6/42 patients relapsed. Three of these patients were treated with 2-CdA again. All three patients reached another CR (+1, +2, +13). Four of the 42 patients had a second malignancy (carcinomas of the bladder, breast, cervix, prostate gland) before receiving 2-CdA. One patient died in CR due to the second malignancy. 2-CdA is a safe and effective treatment of HCL, inducing complete remissions in the majority of patients with only a single cycle of 2-CdA and a paucity of toxicities. Responses are durable and long lasting.

Similarly, the median survival has increased from 3 weeks to 2 years; the median duration of remission, which was 7 months in 1974, has not yet been reached. There was also a significant difference in survival from first recurrence, compared with that of patients with other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia. RT-PCR analysis on bone marrow samples from 14 patients confirmed the presence of the PML/RARA fusion; 13 of the 14 patients achieved 'molecular remission' after therapy. The one patient who remained persistently positive experienced recurrence within 4 months. In seven of the eight patients in whom the disease recurred, the translocation was identified by RT-PCR at the time of relapse, whilst in one patient it was noted 4 months prior to morphological recurrence.

The effect on hemoglobin (Hb), platelets, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC), as well as on transfusion frequency, was examined in 25 patients with MDS (11 RA, four RARS, eight RAEB, two CMML). The median age was 61 years (range 44-81), and the male/female ratio was 14/11. Treatment consisted of ATRA at 25 mg/m2/day p.o. for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, IFN-alpha at 1.5 MIU twice a week s.c. for 52 weeks, and, in patients with initial ANC <500/microl, G-CSF at 100-480 microg daily s.c. according to the degree of ANC. The duration of therapy was scheduled for 12 months. Two patients achieved ongoing CR (+19 months; +16 months), one patient with RA after 3 months and one with CMML after 7 months of treatment. In all patients, the mean ANC increased significantly from 1400+/-200/microl before the start of therapy to 3500+/-600/microl at the end of treatment (p=0.025). In two patients an increase of Hb was observed, and one patient ceased to require transfusions. In an additional patient with RA and 5q-syndrome, the platelet count normalized following administration of ATRA/IFN-alpha, increasing from 89,000/microl to 293,000/microl.

Moreover, clinical remission and reduction of bcr/abl-positive macrophages under IFN therapy lend support to the hypothesis that the presence of malignant stromal macrophages may contribute to the selective expansion of leukaemic precursors and the suppression of normal haematopoiesis in CML.","['Thiele, J', 'Schmitz, B', 'Fuchs, R', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Lorenzen, J', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Schmitz B', 'Fuchs R', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Lorenzen J', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoclasts/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1999/04/22 02:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/22 02:04'],"['1999/04/22 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/22 02:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199811)186:3<331::AID-PATH178>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199811)186:3<331::AID-PATH178>3.0.CO;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 1998 Nov;186(3):331-5. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199811)186:3<331::AID-PATH178>3.0.CO;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to examine ALL for evidence of space-time clustering of date and place of diagnosis by age group. Knox space-time analysis was carried out separately for three different age groups: childhood (0-14 years), young adult (15-34 years) and older adults (35-79 years). Data on 968 cases of ALL aged 0-79 years, arising during 1984-1993 in the areas covered by a specialist population based register of leukaemias and lymphomas in parts of the U.K., were used in the analysis. Space-time clustering of diagnoses was limited to children aged 0-14 years. It was more prominent in those diagnosed in the period 1984-1988, than in those diagnosed in 1989-1993. The clustering may indicate an infectious aetiology for childhood ALL, or could be the result of episodic exposures to some environmental hazard.","['Gilman, E A', 'McNally, R J', 'Cartwright, R A']","['Gilman EA', 'McNally RJ', 'Cartwright RA']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Leeds, UK. e.a.gilman@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1999/04/22 00:00,1999/04/22 00:01,['1999/04/22 00:00'],"['1999/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804998003451 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00345-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Jan;35(1):91-6. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00345-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many reports have underlined the interest of interleukin-7 (IL-7) use in cancer and its pivotal role in immune recognition. This cytokine, initially identified as a B cell growth factor, enhances the anti-tumour properties of immune effector cells via T lymphocyte activation, increased specific cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Nonetheless, few data are available regarding the effect of IL-7 on the expression at the leukaemia cell surface of molecules involved in the immune response, which defective expression could induce tolerance or anergy. This prompted us to study the effects of IL-7 on 20 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 9 cases of lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), in comparison with gamma-interferon, a potent inducer of immune regulation molecule expression. In AML and ALL, IL-7 increased MHC class I molecule expression, while class II molecules were weakly modified. The expression of the tumour necrosis factor family members CD40 and Fas/CD95, together with the adhesion molecules ICAM-1/CD54 and CD58/LFA-3, was also increased in both types of leukaemia. The IL-7 was an efficient inducer of B7-2/CD86 expression in AML and ALL, while increased expression of B7-1/CD80 was only observed in AML. In the corresponding, co-cultured T lymphocyte population, IL-7 more particularly increased B7-1/CD80 and CD58/LFA-3 expression. Finally, pre-incubation of leukaemic cells with IL-7 increased the proliferation of responding, normal allogenic T lymphocytes and their secretion of gamma-IFN and IL-2 in mixed the lymphocyte-tumour reaction. We concluded that IL-7 is efficient at increasing the membrane expression of molecules which are central for the development of the immune response, and at improving allogenic immune recognition. The clinical implications of such data require further in vivo investigation.","['Costello, R T', 'Mallet, F', 'Chambost, H', 'Sainty, D', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Olive, D']","['Costello RT', 'Mallet F', 'Chambost H', 'Sainty D', 'Gastaut JA', 'Olive D']","[""Unite d'Immunologie des Tumeurs, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 232, boulevard Sainte-Marguerite, 13009 Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'HLA-D Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1999/04/22 00:00,1999/04/22 00:01,['1999/04/22 00:00'],"['1999/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1999 Mar;10(1):87-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precursor/cell matrix/endothelial interactions determine retainment or release of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow microenvironment. Consequently, changes in the affinity or quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on either the bone marrow stroma or the cell precursor component during a malignant process will affect cell attachment. Adhesion molecules, therefore, are modulator molecules which alter the biological behavior of leukemic cells in terms of migration and localization properties. Several membrane-bound adhesion molecules and, in some instances, their soluble counterparts which may be biologically active, have been described in acute myeloid leukemia. The panel of receptors expressed demonstrates heterogeneity between various cases of acute myeloid leukemia. There is generally no correlation between the adhesion receptor phenotype and the morphologic or clinical features of acute leukemia. These receptors function in interactions of leukemic blasts with the cellular and matrix components of the marrow microenvironment. Adhesive interactions may influence the proliferation and survival of leukemic cells. However, the precise role that these molecules play in the generation and sustenance of the leukemic state remains undetermined.","['Thomas, X', 'Anglaret, B']","['Thomas X', 'Anglaret B']","[""Service d'hematologie, Hopital edouard-Herriot, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03.""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology']",1999/04/22 00:00,1999/04/22 00:01,['1999/04/22 00:00'],"['1999/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1999 Mar;86(3):265-77.,,179,,,,Molecules d'adhesion cellulaire: expression et fonction dans les leucemies aigues myeloides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the molecular cloning and role in hematopoiesis of a human gene (designated HnudC) homologous to A. nidulans nudC is reported. The amino terminus of the larger human protein (HNUDC = 45 kDa) does not overlap with A. nidulans NUDC (22 kDa). However, NUDC and the C-terminal 94 amino acids of HNUDC are 67% identical. The C-terminal region of the HnudC gene fully complements the A. nidulans temperature-sensitive nudC3 mutation, suggesting that nudC has an essential function in cell growth that is conserved from filamentous fungi to humans. In initial studies, HNUDC levels were much higher in erythroid precursors compared to most other human tissues. Therefore, the potential role of HnudC in hematopoiesis was explored. In normal human bone marrow, HNUDC protein and mRNA are highly expressed in early myeloid and erythroid precursors and decline as these cells terminally differentiate. To determine whether hematopoietic growth factors induce HnudC expression, TF-1 cells were stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This induced a significant increase in HNUDC protein and HnudC mRNA, suggesting that enhancement of HnudC expression in response to growth factor stimulation may be mediated at the transcription level. Furthermore, HNUDC was significantly enhanced in lysates of bone marrow aspirates from patients with acute myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to aspirates from normal controls, suggesting that HnudC is involved in malignant hematopoietic cell growth as well. These data demonstrate that HNUDC is highly expressed in normal and malignant human hematopoietic precursors and suggest it is of functional importance in the proliferation of these cells.","['Miller, B A', 'Zhang, M Y', 'Gocke, C D', 'De Souza, C', 'Osmani, A H', 'Lynch, C', 'Davies, J', 'Bell, L', 'Osmani, S A']","['Miller BA', 'Zhang MY', 'Gocke CD', 'De Souza C', 'Osmani AH', 'Lynch C', 'Davies J', 'Bell L', 'Osmani SA']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, The Milton S.

We demonstrate this by five exemplary follow-up BM samples from patients with BCP-ALL, all of which showed phenotypically aberrant cells according to levels of expression of CD10, CD11a, CD19, CD34, CD44, or CD45RA, as well as according to altered orthogonal light scattering properties. We confirmed the leukemic nature of these cells by polymerase chain reaction-based detection of bcr1/abl transcripts, and of leukemia clone-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements in only the suspicious cells when sorted by flow cytometry, but not in normal BCP or non-B cells. Comparative phenotype mapping thus allows one to distinguish between normal and leukemic cells, and we show that it may enable rapid, specific, and quantitative detection of residual/resurgent leukemia in BCP-ALL.","['Dworzak, M N', 'Stolz, F', 'Froschl, G', 'Printz, D', 'Henn, T', 'Fischer, S', 'Fleischer, C', 'Haas, O A', 'Fritsch, G', 'Gadner, H', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R']","['Dworzak MN', 'Stolz F', 'Froschl G', 'Printz D', 'Henn T', 'Fischer S', 'Fleischer C', 'Haas OA', 'Fritsch G', 'Gadner H', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria. dworzak@ceri.univie.ac.at""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",1999/04/21 00:00,1999/04/21 00:01,['1999/04/21 00:00'],"['1999/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(98)00071-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00071-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Apr;27(4):673-81. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00071-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) bind to related members of this tyrosine kinase receptors family, c-fms and c-kit, respectively. The relative effects of the cytokines M-CSF, SCF, and Flt3L on the proliferation and development of the late myeloid progenitors granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) were investigated. Distinct biologic responses were stimulated by ligand binding to these different tyrosine kinase receptors in enriched GM-CFC. M-CSF stimulated GM-CFC to proliferate and develop into macrophages. SCF, on the other hand, stimulated GM-CFC to develop into neutrophils. Flt3 ligand had a relatively small proliferative effect on enriched GM-CFC compared to SCF and M-CSF and had no ability to either stimulate colony formation or synergize with these two cytokines in promoting DNA synthesis, colony formation, or expansion in liquid culture. Flt3 ligand, however, was capable of maintaining the clonogenic potential of GM-CFC and acted as an anti-apoptotic agent as assessed using the Annexin-V apoptosis assay. GM-CFC cultured in Flt3 ligand eventually formed macrophages and neutrophils in liquid culture. Labeling with the membrane-associated cell tracker dye PKH26 indicated that the majority of the enriched GM-CFC responded to Flt3 ligand by undergoing limited proliferation and macrophage development, whereas other cells survived but did not proliferate and differentiate into macrophages. Thus, Flt3 ligand promoted survival and stimulated development without proliferation in primary-enriched myeloid progenitor cells.","['Nicholls, S E', 'Winter, S', 'Mottram, R', 'Miyan, J A', 'Whetton, A D']","['Nicholls SE', 'Winter S', 'Mottram R', 'Miyan JA', 'Whetton AD']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Cellular Development Unit, Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/21 00:00,1999/04/21 00:01,['1999/04/21 00:00'],"['1999/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(98)00072-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00072-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Apr;27(4):663-72. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00072-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that TGF-beta1 potentially inhibited not only the growth of primitive but also more mature myeloid leukemic cells. Surprisingly, those apparently more mature progenitor cells, such as MV4-11 and Mo7e cells, are very sensitive to the action of TGF-beta. The addition of TGF-beta1 to liquid cultures of these cells significantly inhibited their proliferation, with as much as 72% inhibition of growth of MV4-11 cells. The suppressive effect by TGF-beta1 was not reversed or prevented by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin 3 used to promote cell growth in TF-1a and MV4-11 cells. TGF-beta1 completely abolished the clonal growth of MV4-11 cells in soft agar and inhibited Mo7e, KG-1, K562, TF-1, and TF-1a colony growth by 99%, 90%, 63%, 53%, and 43%, respectively. The cells treated with TGF-beta1 showed progressive accumulation in the G1 phase of cell cycle. Maximal G1 arrest (93%) was observed in MV4-11 cells. Using anti-retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and anti-specific phosphorylated-pRb antibodies, we demonstrated that TGF-beta1 greatly inhibited pRb phosphorylation at serine 795 in MV4-11 and Mo7e cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the sensitivity of myeloid leukemic progenitor cells to growth inhibition by TGF-beta may not be inversely correlated with their maturation stage, and the inhibition of the cells appeared to be linked to the suppression of pRb phosphorylation at serine 795.","['Hu, X', 'Moscinski, L C', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Hu X', 'Moscinski LC', 'Zuckerman KS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida, and H.

There are approximately 10 trials, and early results are generally encouraging. Therefore, the expectation is that antisense DNAs will be important to future chemotherapy. The question considered here is whether antisense DNAs will also be important to future nuclear medicine imaging. While efforts toward developing antisense imaging are comparatively nonexistent thus far, investigations into the mechanisms of cellular transport and localization and the development of a second generation of antisense DNAs have occurred largely within the antisense chemotherapy industry. Fortunately, many of the properties of DNA for antisense imaging, such as high in vivo stability and adequate cell membrane transport, are the same as those for antisense chemotherapy. Unfortunately, interests diverge in the case of several other key properties. For example, rapid localization and clearance kinetics of the radiolabel and prolonged retention in the target are requirements unique to nuclear medicine. No doubt the development of antisense imaging will continue to benefit from improvements in the antisense chemotherapy industry. However, a considerable effort will be required to optimize this approach for imaging (and radiotherapy). The potential of specifically targeting virtually any disease or normal tissue should make this effort worthwhile.","['Hnatowich, D J']",['Hnatowich DJ'],"['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA, Antisense/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Nuclear Medicine', 'Radiopharmaceuticals']",1999/04/21 00:00,1999/04/21 00:01,['1999/04/21 00:00'],"['1999/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1999 Apr;40(4):693-703.,,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of DNA damage was compared with the level of basal DNA damage in control group, represented by healthy donors. Statistically significant increase of basal DNA damage was found in leukemia/lymphoma cells of patients suffered from AML, CML, ALL of T-cell subtype (T-ALL), and NHL, however, no difference in basal DNA damage was found in patients with ALL of early B-cell subtype (B-ALL) and CLL in comparison to control group.

The majority of monocytes expressed CD14 at a high density without CD16 antigen (the CD14+CD16- monocytes). The remaining monocytes co-expressed CD14 and CD16 (the CD14+CD16+ monocytes). These CD14+CD16+ monocytes amounted to 20.6 +/- 15.8%, while those in peripheral blood (PB) obtained from healthy volunteers were 7.3 +/- 3.1% (P < 0.05).

Since typical CD14+CD16+ monocytes are the CD14dimCD16bright population, we compared the additional surface antigens on CD14dimCD16bright monocytes with those of CD14+CD16- monocytes. In PBPC collections, the CD14dimCD16bright monocytes exhibited lower levels of CD11b, CD15, CD33 and CD38 expression and higher levels of CD4, CD11a, CD11c and MHC class II, and also revealed a higher percentage of CD4+ cells and a lower percentage of CD15+ cells and CD38+ cells, compared with the CD14+CD16- monocytes. When compared with the CD14dimCD16bright monocytes in PB, those in PBPC collections exhibited higher expression of CD4 and lower expression of CD11b, and also showed higher percentages of CD4+ cells and CD38+ cells and a lower percentage of CD11b+ cells. These results suggest that PBPC collections may be rich in the CD14+CD16+ monocytes in which the proportion of the immature population is increased.

We also showed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, or 22:6n-3), a fatty acyl chain known to alter microdomain structure in model membranes, also alters the structure and composition of exfoliated vesicles, implying a DHA-induced change in microdomain structure on the cell surface. In this report we show that enrichment of the cells with DHA reverses some of the characteristic differences in composition between the parent plasma membrane and shed microdomain vesicles, but does not alter their phospholipid class composition. In untreated cells, DHA-containing species were found to be a much greater proportion of the total phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) pool than the total phosphatidylcholine (PC) pool in both the plasma membrane and the shed vesicles. After DHA treatment, the proportion of DHA-containing species in the PE and PC pools of the plasma membrane were elevated, and unlike in untreated cells, their proportions were equal in the two pools. In the vesicles shed from DHA-loaded cells, the proportion of DHA-containing species of PE was the same as in the plasma membrane. However, the proportion of DHA-containing species of PC in the vesicles (0.089) was much lower than that found in the plasma membrane (0.194), and was relatively devoid of species with 16-carbon acyl components. These data suggested that DHA-containing species of PC, particularly those having a 16-carbon chain in the sn-1 position, were preferentially retained in the plasma membrane. The data can be interpreted as indicating that DHA induces a restructuring of lateral microdomains on the surface of living cells similar to that predicted by its behavior in model membranes.","['Williams, E E', 'May, B D', 'Stillwell, W', 'Jenski, L J']","['Williams EE', 'May BD', 'Stillwell W', 'Jenski LJ']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis, 723 West Michigan Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. ewilliam@iupui.edu']",['eng'],['R01-CA57212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphatidylcholines/analysis', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/analysis', 'Phospholipids/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/21 00:00,1999/04/21 00:01,['1999/04/21 00:00'],"['1999/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(99)00032-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(99)00032-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Apr 14;1418(1):185-96. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(99)00032-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the relationship between the characteristics of the lipoplexes, their mode of interaction with monocytic THP-1 cells and their ability to transfect these cells. We determined the size and zeta potential of cationic liposomes (composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-(trimethylammonium) propane (DOTAP) and its mixtures with neutral lipids), and lipoplexes at different (+/-) charge ratios. As the (+/-) charge ratio of the lipoplexes decreased to (1/1), a significant reduction in zeta potential and an increase in size was observed. The increase in size resulted from fusion between liposomes promoted by DNA, as demonstrated by a lipid mixing assay, and from aggregation of the complexes. Interaction of liposomes and lipoplexes with THP-1 cells was assessed by monitoring lipid mixing ('fusion') as well as binding and cell association. While no lipid mixing was observed with the 1/2 (+/-) lipid/DNA complexes, lipoplexes with higher (+/-) charge ratios underwent significant fusion in conjunction with extensive cell binding. Liposome binding to cells was dependent on the positive charge of the liposomes, and their fusion could be modulated by the co-lipid. DOTAP/phosphatidylethanolamine (1:1) liposomes fused with THP-1 cells, unlike DOTAP/phosphatidylcholine (1:1) liposomes, although both liposome types bound to the cells to a similar extent. The use of inhibitors of endocytosis indicated that fusion of the cationic liposomes with cells occurred mainly at the plasma membrane level. The presence of serum increased the size of the cationic liposomes, but not that of the lipoplexes. Low concentrations of serum (3%) completely inhibited the fusion of cationic liposomes with cells, while inhibiting binding by only 20%. Our results suggest that binding of cationic liposomes and lipoplexes to cells is governed primarily by electrostatic interactions, whereas their fusion is regulated by the lipid composition and sterically favorable interactions with cell surface molecules. In addition our results indicate no correlation between fusion of the lipoplexes with the plasma membrane and the levels of transfection.","['Pires, P', 'Simoes, S', 'Nir, S', 'Gaspar, R', 'Duzgunes, N', 'Pedroso de Lima, M C']","['Pires P', 'Simoes S', 'Nir S', 'Gaspar R', 'Duzgunes N', 'Pedroso de Lima MC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Apartado 3126, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Coimbra, 3000, Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'MR86K0XRQP (1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium)propane)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', '*Cell Adhesion', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Drug Carriers', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Liposomes/*chemistry', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/chemistry', 'Temperature', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",1999/04/21 00:00,1999/04/21 00:01,['1999/04/21 00:00'],"['1999/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(99)00023-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(99)00023-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Apr 14;1418(1):71-84. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(99)00023-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that BCR/ABL induces phosphorylation and activation of STAT5 by a mechanism that requires the BCR/ABL Src homology (SH)2 domain and the proline-rich binding site of the SH3 domain. Upon expression in 32Dcl3 growth factor-dependent myeloid precursor cells, STAT5 activation-deficient BCR/ABL SH3+SH2 domain mutants functioned as tyrosine kinase and activated Ras, but failed to protect from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of interleukin 3 and/or serum and did not induce leukemia in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. In complementation assays, expression of a dominant-active STAT5B mutant (STAT5B-DAM), but not wild-type STAT5B (STAT5B-WT), in 32Dcl3 cells transfected with STAT5 activation-deficient BCR/ABL SH3+SH2 mutants restored protection from apoptosis, stimulated growth factor-independent cell cycle progression, and rescued the leukemogenic potential in mice. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative STAT5B mutant (STAT5B-DNM) in 32Dcl3 cells transfected with wild-type BCR/ABL inhibited apoptosis resistance, growth factor-independent proliferation, and the leukemogenic potential of these cells. In retrovirally infected mouse bone marrow cells, expression of STAT5B-DNM inhibited BCR/ABL-dependent transformation. Moreover, STAT5B-DAM, but not STAT5B-WT, markedly enhanced the ability of STAT5 activation-defective BCR/ABL SH3+SH2 mutants to induce growth factor-independent colony formation of primary mouse bone marrow progenitor cells. However, STAT5B-DAM did not rescue the growth factor-independent colony formation of kinase-deficient K1172R BCR/ABL or the triple mutant Y177F+R522L+ Y793F BCR/ABL, both of which also fail to activate STAT5. Together, these data demonstrate that STAT5 activation by BCR/ABL is dependent on signaling from more than one domain and document the important role of STAT5-regulated pathways in BCR/ABL leukemogenesis.","['Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Wasik, M A', 'Slupianek, A', 'Salomoni, P', 'Kitamura, T', 'Calabretta, B', 'Skorski, T']","['Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Wasik MA', 'Slupianek A', 'Salomoni P', 'Kitamura T', 'Calabretta B', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA46782-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-CA70815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics']",1999/04/20 00:00,1999/04/20 00:01,['1999/04/20 00:00'],"['1999/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.189.8.1229 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1999 Apr 19;189(8):1229-42. doi: 10.1084/jem.189.8.1229.,PMC2193033,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCL is also expressed in the central nervous system, although its expression pattern has not been examined in detail and its function in neural development is unknown. In this article we present the first analysis of SCL transcriptional regulation in vivo. We have identified three spatially distinct regulatory modules, each of which was both necessary and sufficient to direct reporter gene expression in vivo to three different regions within the normal SCL expression domain, namely, developing endothelium, midbrain, and hindbrain/spinal cord. In addition we have demonstrated that GATA factor binding sites are essential for neural expression of the SCL constructs. The midbrain element was particularly powerful and axonal lacZ expression revealed the details of axonal projections, thus implicating SCL in the development of occulomotor, pupillary, or retinotectal pathways. The neural expression pattern of the SCL gene was highly conserved in mouse, chicken, and zebrafish embryos and the 5' region of the chicken SCL locus exhibited a striking degree of functional conservation in transgenic mice. These data suggest that SCL performs critical functions in neural development. The regulatory elements identified here provide important tools for analyzing these functions.","['Sinclair, A M', 'Gottgens, B', 'Barton, L M', 'Stanley, M L', 'Pardanaud, L', 'Klaine, M', 'Gering, M', 'Bahn, S', 'Sanchez, M', 'Bench, A J', 'Fordham, J L', 'Bockamp, E', 'Green, A R']","['Sinclair AM', 'Gottgens B', 'Barton LM', 'Stanley ML', 'Pardanaud L', 'Klaine M', 'Gering M', 'Bahn S', 'Sanchez M', 'Bench AJ', 'Fordham JL', 'Bockamp E', 'Green AR']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, MRC Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Brain/*embryology/metabolism', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/anatomy & histology/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endothelium/*embryology/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lac Operon/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Spinal Cord/*embryology/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Zebrafish/embryology', '*Zebrafish Proteins']",1999/04/20 00:00,1999/04/20 00:01,['1999/04/20 00:00'],"['1999/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012160699992369 [pii]', '10.1006/dbio.1999.9236 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1999 May 1;209(1):128-42. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1999.9236.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

The patient and her physician may be concerned about potential harm to the fetus from radiation exposure. In reality, however, the risks to the developing fetus are quite small. The accepted cumulative dose of ionizing radiation during pregnancy is 5 rad, and no single diagnostic study exceeds this maximum. For example, the amount of exposure to the fetus from a two-view chest x-ray of the mother is only 0.00007 rad. The most sensitive time period for central nervous system teratogenesis is between 10 and 17 weeks of gestation. Nonurgent radiologic testing should be avoided during this time. Rare consequences of prenatal radiation exposure include a slight increase in the incidence of childhood leukemia and, possibly, a very small change in the frequency of genetic mutations. Such exposure is not an indication for pregnancy termination. Appropriate counseling of patients before radiologic studies are performed is critical.","['Toppenberg, K S', 'Hill, D A', 'Miller, D P']","['Toppenberg KS', 'Hill DA', 'Miller DP']","['Florida Hospital Medical Center, Orlando, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am Fam Physician,American family physician,1272646,,IM,"['Female', 'Fetal Diseases/embryology/*etiology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/etiology', 'Microcephaly/etiology', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*diagnostic imaging', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'Radiation Injuries/embryology/*etiology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Radiography/adverse effects', 'Teaching Materials']",1999/04/20 00:00,1999/04/20 00:01,['1999/04/20 00:00'],"['1999/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Am Fam Physician. 1999 Apr 1;59(7):1813-8, 1820.",,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AMLI/ETO fusion protein has been shown to function mainly as a transcriptional repressor of AML1 target genes and to block AML1 function in vitro and in vivo. However, AML1/ETO can also activate the BCL-2 promoter and cause enhanced hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal in vitro, suggesting gain-of-functions unique to the fusion protein. We used NIH3T3 cells to determine the transforming capacity of AML1/ETO, and to further characterize its mechanism of action. Expression of AML1/ETO in NIH3T3 cells caused cell-type specific cell death, and cellular transformation, characterized by phenotypic changes, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation in nude mice. In contrast, neither expression of AML1A, AML1B or ETO altered the normal growth pattern of the cells. To investigate the mechanism of transformation by AML1/ETO, we analysed the levels of activated, phosphorylated c-Jun (ser63) and other constituents of the AP-1 complex, in the presence of various AML1/ETO related proteins. Expression of AML1/ETO increased the level of c-Jun-P (ser63), and activated AP-1 dependent transcription, which was inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative c-Jun protein. Mutational analysis revealed that the runt homology domain (RHD) and a C-terminal transcriptional repression domain in AML1/ETO are required for transformation, activation of c-Jun and increased AP-1 activity. These results establish the transforming potential of the t(8;21) fusion protein and link this gain-of-function property to modulation of AP-1 activity.","['Frank, R C', 'Sun, X', 'Berguido, F J', 'Jakubowiak, A', 'Nimer, S D']","['Frank RC', 'Sun X', 'Berguido FJ', 'Jakubowiak A', 'Nimer SD']","['Sloan Kettering Institute, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA70388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/04/20 00:00,1999/04/20 00:01,['1999/04/20 00:00'],"['1999/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202459 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Mar 4;18(9):1701-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202459.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its biological role is to block differentiation by repressing a subset of the Ste11-regulated genes essential for conjugation and meiosis until the cells reach a critical level of nutrient starvation. By using the phenotypic suppression of the S. pombe temperature-sensitive pat1 mutant that commits lethal haploid meiosis at the restrictive temperature, we have cloned ROD1, a functional homologue of nrd1(+), from rat and human cDNA libraries. Like nrd1(+), ROD1 encodes a protein with four repeats of typical RNA binding domains, though its amino acid homology to Nrd1 is limited. When expressed in the fission yeast, ROD1 behaves in a way that is functionally similar to nrd1(+), being able to repress Ste11-regulated genes and to inhibit conjugation upon overexpression. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs of adult and embryonic rat. Like nrd1(+) for fission yeast differentiation, overexpressed ROD1 effectively blocks both 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-induced megakaryocytic and sodium butyrate-induced erythroid differentiation of the K562 human leukemia cells without affecting their proliferative ability.

The promoter activities of numerous genes expressed in hematopoietic cells are regulated by AML1 proteins or ETS proteins. MEF (for myeloid ELF-1-like factor) is a recently cloned ETS family member that, like AML1B, can strongly transactivate several of these promoters, which led us to examine whether MEF functionally or physically interacts with AML1 proteins. In this study, we demonstrate direct interactions between MEF and AML1 proteins, including the AML1/ETO fusion protein, in t(8;21)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Using mutational analysis, we identified a novel ETS-interacting subdomain (EID) in the C-terminal portion of the Runt homology domain (RHD) in AML1 proteins and determined that the N-terminal region of MEF was responsible for its interaction with AML1. MEF and AML1B synergistically transactivated an interleukin 3 promoter reporter gene construct, yet the activating activity of MEF was abolished when MEF was coexpressed with AML1/ETO. The repression by AML1/ETO was independent of DNA binding but depended on its ability to interact with MEF, suggesting that AML1/ETO can repress genes not normally regulated by AML1 via protein-protein interactions. Interference with MEF function by AML1/ETO may lead to dysregulation of genes important for myeloid differentiation, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of t(8;21) AML.","['Mao, S', 'Frank, R C', 'Zhang, J', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Nimer, S D']","['Mao S', 'Frank RC', 'Zhang J', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK052208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK052208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Elf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/17 00:00,1999/04/17 00:01,['1999/04/17 00:00'],"['1999/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.5.3635 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 May;19(5):3635-44. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.5.3635.,PMC84165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three proteins interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin; beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind a carboxy-terminal region in a mutually exclusive manner, while p120 binds the juxtamembrane region. Unlike beta-catenin and plakoglobin, p120 does not interact with alpha-catenin, the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), or the transcription factor Lef-1, suggesting that it has unique binding partners and plays a distinct role in the cadherin-catenin complex. Using p120 as bait, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified a novel transcription factor which we named Kaiso. Kaiso's deduced amino acid sequence revealed an amino-terminal BTB/POZ protein-protein interaction domain and three carboxy-terminal zinc fingers of the C2H2 DNA-binding type. Kaiso thus belongs to a rapidly growing family of POZ-ZF transcription factors that include the Drosophila developmental regulators Tramtrak and Bric a brac, and the human oncoproteins BCL-6 and PLZF, which are causally linked to non-Hodgkins' lymphoma and acute promyelocytic leukemia, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies to Kaiso were generated and used to immunolocalize the protein and confirm the specificity of the p120-Kaiso interaction in mammalian cells. Kaiso specifically coprecipitated with a variety of p120-specific monoclonal antibodies but not with antibodies to alpha- or beta-catenin, E-cadherin, or APC. Like other POZ-ZF proteins, Kaiso localized to the nucleus and was associated with specific nuclear dots. Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays mapped the binding domains to Arm repeats 1 to 7 of p120 and the carboxy-terminal 200 amino acids of Kaiso. In addition, Kaiso homodimerized via its POZ domain but it did not heterodimerize with BCL-6, which heterodimerizes with PLZF. The involvement of POZ-ZF proteins in development and cancer makes Kaiso an interesting candidate for a downstream effector of cadherin and/or p120 signaling.","['Daniel, J M', 'Reynolds, A B']","['Daniel JM', 'Reynolds AB']","['Department of Cell Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-2175, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Catenins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB33 protein, human)', '0 (delta catenin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Catenins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Zinc Fingers']",1999/04/17 00:00,1999/04/17 00:01,['1999/04/17 00:00'],"['1999/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.5.3614 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 May;19(5):3614-23. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.5.3614.,PMC84161,,,,['GENBANK/AF097416'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 signals by induction of a gp130 homodimer (e.g. IL-6), whereas CNTF and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signal via a heterodimer of gp130 and LIF receptor (LIFR). Despite binding to the same receptor component (gp130) and a similar protein structure, IL-6 and CNTF share only 6% sequence identity. Using molecular modeling we defined a putative LIFR binding epitope on CNTF that consists of three distinct regions (C-terminal A-helix/N-terminal AB loop, BC loop, C-terminal CD-loop/N-terminal D-helix). A corresponding gp130-binding site on IL-6 was exchanged with this epitope. The resulting IL-6/CNTF chimera lost the capacity to signal via gp130 on cells without LIFR, but acquired the ability to signal via the gp130/LIFR heterodimer and STAT3 on responsive cells. Besides identifying a specific LIFR binding epitope on CNTF, our results suggest that receptor recognition sites of cytokines are organized as modules that are exchangeable even between cytokines with limited sequence homology.","['Kallen, K J', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Lelievre, E', 'Vollmer, P', 'Aasland, D', 'Renne, C', 'Mullberg, J', 'Myer zum Buschenfelde, K H', 'Gascan, H', 'Rose-John, S']","['Kallen KJ', 'Grotzinger J', 'Lelievre E', 'Vollmer P', 'Aasland D', 'Renne C', 'Mullberg J', 'Myer zum Buschenfelde KH', 'Gascan H', 'Rose-John S']","['I.

Markers of bone turnover were compared with those of 35 age and body mass index (BMI) matched young adults (18 male). Growth hormone status had previously been determined using an insulin tolerance test and arginine stimulation test. Eight patients were classified as severe growth hormone deficiency (group 1), 12 patients as growth hormone insufficient (group 2) and 11 patients as normal (group 3). Vertebral trabecular BMD, lumbar spine and femoral neck integral BMD and forearm cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was measured 17.8 (6.8-28.6) years after cranial irradiation and was expressed as Z (standard deviation) scores. There was a significant reduction in vertebral trabecular BMD (median Z score -1.25, P < 0.001), in lumbar spine integral BMD (median Z score -0.74, P = 0.001), in forearm cortical BMC (median Z score -1.35, P < 0.001), and less so in femoral neck integral BMD (median Z score -0.43, P = 0.03). There was no difference among the growth hormone status groups for the following BMD measurements: vertebral trabecular BMD, lumbar spine integral BMD or femoral neck integral BMD (P = 0.8, P = 0.96 and P = 0.4 respectively). There was only a marginal significant difference for BMD at the wrist between growth hormone status groups (P = 0.04). There was no correlation between the BMD measurements with time since or age at diagnosis and no difference in markers of bone turnover between patients and controls; median serum osteocalcin 13.3 and 12.0 ng ml (P = 0.7), respectively, and for ICTP 5.0 and 4.9 microg L (P = 0.67) respectively. In conclusion, there is a highly significant reduction in BMD in young adults following treatment for ALL in childhood. The reduction in BMD affects both trabecular and cortical bone but did not seem to be related to time since diagnosis, age at diagnosis, or current growth hormone status. Possible explanations include a direct effect of chemotherapy, steroids or both on bone during childhood and hence an effect on the accretion of bone mass. In view of the risk of fractures in patients with osteopenia, adults treated for ALL in childhood may be at an increased risk of bone fractures later in life irrespective of the underlying cause of the osteopenia and thus intervention should be considered.","['Brennan, B M', 'Rahim, A', 'Adams, J A', 'Eden, O B', 'Shalet, S M']","['Brennan BM', 'Rahim A', 'Adams JA', 'Eden OB', 'Shalet SM']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Density/*physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Human Growth Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*therapy']",1999/04/17 00:00,1999/04/17 00:01,['1999/04/17 00:00'],"['1999/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690296 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Apr;79(11-12):1859-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690296.,PMC2362787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CB30865 was the most potent growth inhibitory agent (IC50 values in the range 1-100 nM for several mouse and human cell types). CB300179 and CB300189 were active in the micromolar range. Against W1L2 cells, CB300179 and CB300189 demonstrated reduced potency in the presence of exogenous thymidine (dThd), and against a W1L2:C1 TS overproducing cell line. In contrast, CB30865 retained activity in these systems. Furthermore, combinations of precursors and end products of folate metabolism, e.g. dThd/hypoxanthine (HX) or leucovorin (LV), did not prevent activity. CB30865 did not interfere with the incorporation of tritiated dThd, uridine or leucine after 4 h. A cell line was raised with acquired resistance to CB30865 (W1L2:R865; > 200-fold), which was not cross-resistant to CB300179 or CB300189. In addition, W1L2:R865 cells were as sensitive as parental cells to agents from all the major chemotherapeutic drug classes. CB300179 and CB300189 induced an S phase accumulation (preventable by co-administration of dThd). No cell cycle redistribution was observed following exposure (4-48 h) to an equitoxic concentration of CB30865. In the NCI anticancer drug-discovery screen, CB30865 displayed a pattern of activity which was not consistent with known anti-tumour agents.

Efficacy studies in mice bearing MDR syngeneic tumours (P388/DX Johnson, MC26) or human tumour xenografts (A2780AD, CH1/DOXr, H69/LX) demonstrated that co-administration of XR9051 significantly potentiated the anti-tumour activity of a range of cytotoxic drugs. This modulatory activity was observed following parenteral and oral co-administration of XR9051. In addition, the combination schedules were well-tolerated. Following intravenous administration in mice, XR9051 is rapidly distributed and accumulates in tumours and other tissues. In addition, the compound is well-absorbed after oral administration.

In ill animals, a decrease in the observed heterozygosity level was detected, as compared to healthy animals and the expected heterozygosity level. The observed heterozygosity level exceeds the expected one in virus carriers. The detected features of the heterozygosity level in the studied groups allow the heterozygosity level for locus BoLA-DRB3 to be considered a nonspecific factor of resistance to leukemia and are heterozygous animals to have higher resistance to bovine leukemia.

SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: A clinical review combined with a retrospective cohort study of 380 patients, 28 with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, three with common variable immunodeficiency, 147 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 57 with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and 145 with non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma. SETTING: A university hospital and The State Serum Institute in Copenhagen. INTERVENTION: Clinical examination of each patient with special attention to chronic inflammatory and autoimmune manifestations. Biopsies were taken from non-infectious infiltrates, some of which were additionally tested with PCR analysis for gene rearrangements. Serological screening with a test battery for various autoantibodies was used in combination with techniques for the detection of M-components and monoclonal B-cell proliferation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and/or serological autoimmune manifestations, M-component and other immunoglobulin alterations, and inflammatory tissue changes were studied in patients with chronic inflammatory, polyclonal or oligoclonal pseudolymphomas and in monoclonal, malignant extranodal lymphomas. RESULTS: In 380 consecutive patients, 49 (12.9%) had extranodal manifestations, of whom 47 also had autoimmune manifestations. Nearly half of the 47 patients had more than one autoimmune manifestation. There was a strong correlation between clinical signs and corresponding autoantibodies such as anti-SSA and -SSB antibodies in Sjogren's syndrome (10 cases), antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in thyroiditis and Graves' disease (10 cases), and parietal cell antibodies in gastric ulcers with maltoma (12 cases). Clinical and serological signs of autoimmunity correlated strongly with female sex (34, 72% women; and 13, 28% men) and with immunoglobulin alterations.

Sensitivities of the PCR for amplification of BSV gag and pol/env nucleic acid sequences from cell culture total DNA were 10 ng and 10 pg of DNA, respectively, as determined by the analysis of the amplified PCR products on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. The specificity of the PCR for both primer sets tested was confirmed when the amplified cDNA products of the expected size reacted positively with the corresponding virus-specific digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probes in Southern blot chemiluminescent hybridization assays. No amplification was obtained when the BSV-specific primers were used in the PCR with DNA material specific to either bovine leukemia virus (BLV) or bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) provirus genomic DNA. No cross-hybridization was obtained when the BSV-specific cDNA probes were allowed to react with BLV or BIV provirus DNA. The PCR targeting the gag and pol/env gene regions of the BSV provirus genome may be an alternative to conventional methods for the confirmation of the presence of BSV in cell cultures used for virus isolation, and for the diagnosis of BSV infection from bovine peripheral blood leukocytes.","['Pamba, R', 'Jeronimo, C', 'Archambault, D']","['Pamba R', 'Jeronimo C', 'Archambault D']","['University of Quebec at Montreal, Department of Biological Sciences, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cattle', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Genes, env/genetics', 'Genes, gag/genetics', 'Genes, pol/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spumavirus/*genetics/growth & development/*isolation & purification']",1999/04/16 00:00,1999/04/16 00:01,['1999/04/16 00:00'],"['1999/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0166-0934(98)00179-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(98)00179-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1999 Mar;78(1-2):199-208. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(98)00179-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eggs of Single Comb White Leghorns were from a commercial breeder (stock F) and from a pathogen-free flock (stock N). RT-PCR was undertaken on isolated RNA from 20 unfertilized egg samples using seven sets of primers that correspond to the ALV gp85 envelope glycoprotein which determines the ALV subgroup classification. An ELISA assay for ALV gs antigen of egg albumen was positive for all stock F birds tested and negative for all stock N birds. Virus isolation was undertaken by inoculating egg albumen, feather pulp, or blood from five stock F chickens onto cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts (C/E). IFA analysis of the inoculated C/E cultures indicated that all stock F birds tested contained infectious ALV. For the virus-positive stock F chickens, RT-PCR analyses using primers designed to detect all ALV subgroups detected ALV in 15/15 (100%) egg albumen samples, while primers designed to detect subgroup A ALV were positive for 12/15 (80%) egg albumen samples. RT-PCR products were not detected from five egg albumen samples from five stock N chickens by any primer sets. Direct sequencing using primers specific for subgroup A ALV verified the viral subgroup in the RT-PCR amplification products.

This finding may be related to exposure to childhood infections. Therefore, epidemiologic studies on the risk of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer among teachers were systematically reviewed. Altogether 26 relevant investigations were identified, most from ad hoc publications rather than from scientific journals. Elevated risks of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma were found in studies using proportional mortality or mortality odds ratios as outcome measures. However, these observations may reflect low overall mortality and do not necessarily indicate high death rates from the cancers of interest. In studies deriving standardized mortality or incidence ratios, the risk estimates were generally lower. The most striking finding was for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (approximate summary relative risk 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.62), but it was likely to have been exaggerated by publication bias.

Blood donations were initially screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on viral lysates, and repeatedly reactive samples were further tested by WB2.3. When available, samples were also tested by PCR, two additional ELISAs based on recombinant antigens (recombinant ELISAs), a new-generation WB assay (WB2.4), and the INNO-LIA. Of the 18,169 samples tested, 292 (1.61%) were repeatedly reactive in the ELISAs (viral lysate based) and were further tested by WB2.3; 97 were positive (19 that were typed as HTLV type I [HTLV-I], 12 that were typed as HTLV type II [HTLV-II], and 66 that were nontypeable), 17 were negative, and 178 had indeterminate results. Of the samples with indeterminate results, 172 were tested by INNO-LIA, which could resolve 153 samples as negative. Regarding the positive samples, WB2. 3 and INNO-LIA produced concordant results for all HTLV-I-positive samples, whereas for HTLV-II they agreed for 10 of 12 samples; the 2 samples with discordant results were considered to be positive for HTLV-II by WB with WB2.3 but negative for HTLV-II by INNO-LIA and the two recombinant ELISAs. Furthermore, of the 66 nontypeable samples, 60 underwent testing by INNO-LIA; 54 turned out to be negative by the latter test as well as by recombinant ELISAs. In conclusion, the new serological confirmatory assay for HTLV (INNO-LIA HTLV I/II Ab) resolved the results for the majority of the indeterminate and positive-untypeable samples frequently observed by WB assays.","['Sabino, E C', 'Zrein, M', 'Taborda, C P', 'Otani, M M', 'Ribeiro-Dos-Santos, G', 'Saez-Alquezar, A']","['Sabino EC', 'Zrein M', 'Taborda CP', 'Otani MM', 'Ribeiro-Dos-Santos G', 'Saez-Alquezar A']","['Fundacao Pro-Sangue, Sao Paulo, Brazil. sabinoec@usp.br']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,,IM,"['*Blood Donors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Viremia/*diagnosis']",1999/04/16 00:00,1999/04/16 00:01,['1999/04/16 00:00'],"['1999/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JCM.37.5.1324-1328.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1999 May;37(5):1324-8. doi: 10.1128/JCM.37.5.1324-1328.1999.,PMC84764,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may be at risk of osteopenia as a result of previous therapy or as a consequence of the disease process itself. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements of bone mineral content (BMC) for the whole body and at the lumbar spine and hip were taken in 35 (14 male) long-term survivors of ALL and compared with results in 20 (10 male) survivors of other malignancies and 31 (17 male) healthy sibling controls. The measured BMC was expressed as a percentage of a predicted value derived from the control group and based on the variables that had influence upon it. BMC (%) was reduced at the spine in the ALL group compared with controls [92.4 (8.0)% versus 100.4 (9.7)%, respectively; p < 0.005] and at the hip compared with both other malignancies and controls [89.0 (11.5)% versus 96.1 (11.7)% and 100.4 (9.2)%, respectively; p < 0.0005]. Increasing length of time off therapy was associated with a significant increase in %BMC at both the spine and the hip. For the spine, this association was significantly different between the ALL group and other malignancies, suggesting that any gain in %BMC after therapy was slower in children treated for ALL. Both exercise capacity and levels of physical activity were correlated with %BMC at the hip (r = 0.44, p < 0.001 and r = 0.29, p < 0.01, respectively). Previous exposure to methotrexate, ifosfamide, and bleomycin was associated with a reduction in %BMC at the spine. Exposure to 6-mercaptopurine and cisplatin was associated with a reduction at the hip. In conclusion, children treated for ALL are osteopenic. The mechanism is probably multifactorial but is partially related to previous chemotherapy, limited exercise capacity, and relative physical inactivity.","['Warner, J T', 'Evans, W D', 'Webb, D K', 'Bell, W', 'Gregory, J W']","['Warner JT', 'Evans WD', 'Webb DK', 'Bell W', 'Gregory JW']","['Department of Child Health, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom. warnerJT@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Puberty', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Reference Values', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Spine/physiopathology', 'Survivors', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/15 00:00,1999/04/15 00:01,['1999/04/15 00:00'],"['1999/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199904010-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1999 Apr;45(4 Pt 1):544-51. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199904010-00014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the in vitro effects of high (10(-3) M) and low (10(-6) M) concentrations of methylprednisolone (MP) on freshly isolated bone marrow leukemic cells from nine newly diagnosed patients with AML by light and electron microscopy (EM) and agarose gel electrophoresis. A marked increase in MP-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells, with a maximum effect at 24 hr of exposure to both low and high concentrations of MP (10(-6) M and 10(-3) M), was demonstrated by light microscopy in cultures of four (three with AML-M1 and one with AML-M7) of the nine patients. In three cases, the increase in the number of apoptotic cells induced by high-concentration MP was approximately twice that observed when the lower concentration was used. A few apoptotic cells were detected in the cultures from the other five patients. However, a typical DNA ladder pattern of apoptosis was observed on gel electrophoresis of MP-treated leukemic cells from one patient (AML-M1) after 2 hr of incubation with both high- and low-MP concentrations. In two patients, a nonspecific DNA smear was observed only when high-concentration MP was used. The increase in differentiated leukemic cells induced by MP was also dose dependent, and was observed in cultures from all but one patient. Morphological features of apoptosis and differentiation were also confirmed by EM studies. The results of the present study, together with our previous clinical experience, suggest that MP, especially at high doses, could have a significant role in the treatment of some AML patients by inducing apoptosis and differentiation of leukemic cells.","['Ozbek, N', 'Erdemli, E', 'Hicsonmez, G', 'Okur, H', 'Tekelioglu, M']","['Ozbek N', 'Erdemli E', 'Hicsonmez G', 'Okur H', 'Tekelioglu M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/15 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/15 02:02'],"['1999/04/15 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/15 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199904)60:4<255::AID-AJH1>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199904)60:4<255::aid-ajh1>3.0.co;2-s [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Apr;60(4):255-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199904)60:4<255::aid-ajh1>3.0.co;2-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it can be incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, fludarabine is also a potent inhibitor of cells with a low growth fraction, thus it must have other mechanisms of action. STAT1, which is activated in response to many lymphocyte-activating cytokines including the interferons, is essential for cell-mediated immunity, as the absence of this protein is associated with prominent defects in the ability to control viral infections. Here we show that fludarabine, but not the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A, inhibits the cytokine-induced activation of STAT1 and STAT1-dependent gene transcription in normal resting or activated lymphocytes. Fludarabine caused a specific depletion of STAT1 protein (and mRNA) but not of other STATs. This loss of STAT1 was also seen in cells from patients treated with fludarabine in vivo. Brief exposure to fludarabine led to a sustained loss of STAT1, analogous to the prolonged period of immunosuppression induced by exposure to the drug in vivo. Thus, STAT1 may be a useful target in the development of new immunosuppressive and antineoplastic agents.","['Frank, D A', 'Mahajan, S', 'Ritz, J']","['Frank DA', 'Mahajan S', 'Ritz J']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. david_frank@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['CA41619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*physiology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1999/04/15 02:02,2001/03/23 10:01,['1999/04/15 02:02'],"['1999/04/15 02:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1999/04/15 02:02 [entrez]']",['10.1038/7445 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Med. 1999 Apr;5(4):444-7. doi: 10.1038/7445.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Controlled prospective study. SETTING: Academic research environment. ANIMAL(S): Female CB6F1 mice between 6 and 8 weeks old. INTERVENTION(S): Mice were divided randomly into three groups, which included a control group in an in vivo study (group I) and two groups in an in vitro study (groups II and III). Mice were killed at 116-120 hours (group I) and 44-48 hours (groups II and III) after hCG injection. Two-cell embryos (groups II and III) and blastocysts (group I) were obtained. Embryos in group II were cocultured with human tubal fluid (HTF) + 0.5% human serum albumin and in group III with HTF + rhLIF (1,000 U/mL) under paraffin oil. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The embryonic numbers in different stages were recorded and compared. RESULT(S): Similar early embryo development to the four- to eight-cell and morula stages was noted between groups II and III (87.3% versus 91.0% and 74.6% versus 87.1%, respectively). However, further embryo development to the blastocyst, expanded blastocyst, and hatching blastocyst in group II (48.1%, 31.7%, and 18.5%, respectively) was lower than that in group III (83.6%, 53.7%, and 37.8%). CONCLUSION(S): RhLIF does not provide obvious stimulation in the early mouse embryo. However, rhLIF has positive effects on preimplantation blastocyst growth, differentiation, and hatching.","['Tsai, H D', 'Chang, C C', 'Hsieh, Y Y', 'Lo, H Y', 'Hsu, L W', 'Chang, S C']","['Tsai HD', 'Chang CC', 'Hsieh YY', 'Lo HY', 'Hsu LW', 'Chang SC']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, China Medical College Hospital, China Medical College, Taichung, Taiwan.

AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the eosinophil chemotactic agents in the BAL fluid, to compare these findings with in vitro studies on selected cytokines, and to investigate the interactions between these cytokines. METHODS: Neutralizing antibodies for interleukins (IL) -2, -5 and -8, RANTES and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were added to the BAL fluid, and the chemotactic activity was tested with eosinophils from allergic donors. Eosinophils from healthy donors were preincubated with IL-5 in order to mimic the primed state of eosinophils from allergics, and the migration towards recombinant IL-5, IL-8, and RANTES in different combinations was measured. Eosinophils from allergic donors were also used. RESULTS: Anti-IL-5, anti-IL-8 and anti-RANTES inhibited the chemotactic activity in the BAL fluid. Recombinant RANTES induced migration, which was enhanced by preincubation of the cells with IL-5. Only eosinophils from symptomatic allergics responded to IL-8, and IL-5 was not sufficient to prime normal eosinophils in vitro to an IL-8 response. A negative correlation was found between the level of in vivo activation of the cells and their response to IL-5, and a positive correlation with the response to RANTES. CONCLUSION: IL-8 and RANTES are important for eosinophil accumulation to the lung of pollen-allergic asthmatics. IL-5 alone may not be responsible for the priming of eosinophils in vivo, but is an essential cofactor for the other chemoattractants.","['Lampinen, M', 'Rak, S', 'Venge, P']","['Lampinen M', 'Rak S', 'Venge P']","['Asthma Research Centre, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-8)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Asthma/*etiology', 'Chemokine CCL5/*physiology', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/*physiology', 'Interleukin-8/*physiology', 'Lung/*immunology', 'Male']",1999/04/15 00:00,1999/04/15 00:01,['1999/04/15 00:00'],"['1999/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2222.1999.00390.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 1999 Mar;29(3):314-22. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2222.1999.00390.x.,,,['Clin Exp Allergy. 1999 Mar;29(3):287-90.

Using the LP-BM5 model of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency, we found alterations in HPA axis function, manifested as an increase in circulating levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone, beginning after only 3 mo of infection. These changes occurred contemporaneously with a shift in the profile of circulating cytokines from a Th1-dominant (IFN-gamma) to Th2-dominant (IL-4, IL-10) phenotype. No significant changes in either circulating IL-1beta, IL-6, or TNF-alpha levels were observed in infected mice. Administering the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 to infected mice normalized plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone levels, indicating that glutamate was a major activator of the HPA axis. Moreover, MK-801 treatment of late-stage mice also reversed the type 1 to type 2 cytokine shift to a degree comparable or superior to treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486. These findings indicate that HPA axis activation during LP-BM5 retrovirus infection is mediated by the chronic hyperactivation of glutamatergic pathways in the hypothalamus. Through this mechanism, the degree of peripheral immunodeficiency observed in the late-stage disease is profoundly augmented.","['Espey, M G', 'Basile, A S']","['Espey MG', 'Basile AS']","['Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. michaele@bldg8.niddk.nih.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '6LR8C1B66Q (Dizocilpine Maleate)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/blood/physiology', 'Dizocilpine Maleate/administration & dosage', 'Glutamic Acid/immunology/*physiology', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Apr 15;162(8):4998-5002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshly isolated monocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid secreted high levels of IL-6 protein, which coincided with enhanced binding activity of NF-kappa B as well as with phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK proteins. The ERK pathway-specific inhibitor PD98059 inhibited IL-6 secretion from monocytes. Transient overexpression of inactive mutants of either Raf-1 or JNK1 showed that both pathways were involved in kappa B-dependent IL-6 promoter activity. By using PD98059, we demonstrated that the Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B but, rather, acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B. Interestingly, it was shown that NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription, both in the context of the IL-6 promoter as well as on its own, was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c-Jun protein. We conclude that okadaic acid-induced IL-6 gene expression is at least partly mediated through the ERK1/2 and JNK pathway-dependent activation of NF-kappa B transcriptional capacity. Our results suggest that the JNK pathway may regulate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun.","['Tuyt, L M', 'Dokter, W H', 'Birkenkamp, K', 'Koopmans, S B', 'Lummen, C', 'Kruijer, W', 'Vellenga, E']","['Tuyt LM', 'Dokter WH', 'Birkenkamp K', 'Koopmans SB', 'Lummen C', 'Kruijer W', 'Vellenga E']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/*physiology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/immunology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Apr 15;162(8):4893-902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hypothesis was evaluated in the model of murine Listeria monocytogenes infection. The influence of nonpathogenic L. innocua on the L. monocytogenes p60-specific T cell response was analyzed. We show that some CD4 T cell clones raised against purified p60 from L. monocytogenes cross-react with p60 purified from L. innocua. The L. monocytogenes p60-specific CD4 T cell clone 1A recognized the corresponding L. innocua p60 peptide QAAKPAPAPSTN, which differs only in the first amino acid residue. In vitro experiments revealed that after L. monocytogenes infection of APCs, MHC class I-restricted presentation of p60 occurs, while MHC class II-restricted p60 presentation is inhibited. L. innocua-infected cells presented p60 more weakly but equally well in the context of both MHC class I and MHC class II. In contrast to these in vitro experiments the infection of mice with L. monocytogenes induced a strong p60-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell response, while L. innocua infection failed to induce p60-specific T cells. L. innocua booster infection, however, expanded p60-specific memory T cells induced by previous L. monocytogenes infection. In conclusion, these findings suggest that infection with a frequently occurring environmental bacterium such as L. innocua, which is nonpathogenic and not adapted to intracellular replication, can contribute to the maintenance of memory T cells specific for a related intracellular pathogen.","['Geginat, G', 'Nichterlein, T', 'Kretschmar, M', 'Schenk, S', 'Hof, H', 'Lalic-Multhaler, M', 'Goebel, W', 'Bubert, A']","['Geginat G', 'Nichterlein T', 'Kretschmar M', 'Schenk S', 'Hof H', 'Lalic-Multhaler M', 'Goebel W', 'Bubert A']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Fakultat fur Klinische Medizin Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany. geginat@rumms.uni-mannheim.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (60 kDa protein, Listeria monocytogenes)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Bacterial Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'Clone Cells/immunology/microbiology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia P388', 'Listeria/*immunology', 'Listeria monocytogenes/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Listeriosis/immunology/microbiology', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Apr 15;162(8):4781-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have undertaken a detailed analysis of LIF genomic organization and gene transcription and investigated the proteins expressed from alternate transcripts. Previously unidentified LIF transcripts, containing alternate first exons spliced onto common second and third exons, were cloned from murine embryonic stem cells, human embryonal carcinoma cells, and primary porcine fibroblasts. Based on sequence homology and position within the genomic sequence, this confirmed the existence of the LIF-M transcript in species other than the mouse and identified a new class of transcript, designated LIF-T. Thus, a complex genomic organization of the LIF gene, conserved among eutherian mammals, results in the expression of three LIF transcripts (LIF-D, LIF-M, and LIF-T) differentially expressed from alternate promoters. The first exon of the LIF-T transcript contained no in-frame AUG, causing translation to initiate downstream of the secretory signal sequence at the first AUG in exon two, producing a truncated LIF protein that was localized within the cell. Enforced secretion of this protein demonstrated that it could act as a LIF receptor agonist. Regulated expression of biologically active intracellular and extracellular LIF cytokine could thus provide alternate mechanisms for the modulation of hematopoiesis and immune system function.","['Haines, B P', 'Voyle, R B', 'Pelton, T A', 'Forrest, R', 'Rathjen, P D']","['Haines BP', 'Voyle RB', 'Pelton TA', 'Forrest R', 'Rathjen PD']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Extracellular Space/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/agonists/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Fluid/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/agonists/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Swine', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Apr 15;162(8):4637-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While AG-490 has been considered to be a Janus kinase (JAK)2-specific inhibitor, these conclusions were primarily drawn from acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells that lack readily detectable levels of JAK3. In the present study, evidence is provided that clearly demonstrates AG-490 potently suppresses IL-2-induced T cell proliferation, a non-JAK2-dependent signal, in a dose-dependent manner in T cell lines D10 and CTLL-2. AG-490 blocked JAK3 activation and phosphorylation of its downstream counterpart substrates, STATs. Inhibition of JAK3 by AG-490 also compromised the Shc/Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways as measured by phosphorylation of Shc and extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). AG-490 effectively inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activities of several transcription factors including STAT1, -3, -5a, and -5b and activating protein-1 (AP-1) as judged by Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These data suggest that AG-490 is a potent inhibitor of the JAK3/STAT, JAK3/AP-1, and JAK3/MAPK pathways and their cellular consequences. Taken together, these findings support the notion that AG-490 possesses previously unrecognized clinical potential as an immunotherapeutic drug due to its inhibitory effects on T cell-derived signaling pathways.","['Wang, L H', 'Kirken, R A', 'Erwin, R A', 'Yu, C R', 'Farrar, W L']","['Wang LH', 'Kirken RA', 'Erwin RA', 'Yu CR', 'Farrar WL']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Binding Sites/drug effects/immunology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Apr 1;162(7):3897-904.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This event, characterized by DNA fragmentation, correlated with downregulation of the survival protein, BCL-xL, and decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi[m]) that ultimately resulted in cell death. Reorientation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the cells inner-to-outer plasma membrane leaflet and inhibition of the aminophospholipid translocase was observed upon hemin-treatment. Constitutive expression of BCL-2 did not inhibit hemin-induced alterations in lipid asymmetry or decrease in deltapsi[m], and only moderately prevented DNA fragmentation. BCL-2, on the other hand, effectively inhibited actinomycin D-induced DNA fragmentation, the appearance of PS at the cells outer leaflet and the decrease in deltapsi[m]. The caspase inhibitor, z.VAD.fmk, blocked DNA fragmentation by both hemin and actinomycin D, but inhibited PS externalization only in the actinomycin D-treated cells. These results suggest that, unlike pharmacologically-induced apoptosis, PS externalization triggered by differentiation-induced apoptosis occurs by a mechanism that is associated with a decrease in deltapsi[m], but independent of BCL-2 and caspases.","['Diaz, C', 'Lee, A T', 'McConkey, D J', 'Schroit, A J']","['Diaz C', 'Lee AT', 'McConkey DJ', 'Schroit AJ']","['The Department of Cell Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA-69676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-41714/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400484 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1999 Mar;6(3):218-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400484.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the relationship between differentiation and apoptosis in DMSO sensitive and resistant F-MEL cells. Clear apoptosis was not observed in DMSO-treated sensitive F-MEL (strain 745A) cells during the induction of differentiation. In contrast, DMSO-induced 745A cells exhibited delayed apoptosis compared to uninduced cells. Since the Bcl-2 family members play a major role in the control of apoptosis and/or differentiation, we determined their expression before and after DMSO or HMBA treatment. Neither untreated nor chemically-induced 745A cells expressed the Bcl-2 protein. The levels of Bax and Bad proteins remained relatively constant during DMSO-induced differentiation. DMSO or HMBA treatment of 745A cells induced a marked increase of Bcl-XL expression during the late phase of differentiation which persisted even when the cells began to die. This upregulation of Bcl-XL was independent of cell density but was correlated with cell arrest in G0/G1. DMSO treatment induced a similar delay of apoptosis and enhancement of Bcl-XL expression in F-MEL (strain TFP10) cells which fail to synthesize haemoglobin in the presence of DMSO. Dexamethasone, which blocks DMSO-induced differentiation of F-MEL cells, prevented the induction of Bcl-XL. Inhibitors such as imidazole or succinylacetone, which inhibit haemoglobin synthesis but not commitment to terminal cell division, did not suppress Bcl-XL induction in DMSO-induced cells. Taken together, these results indicate that DMSO treatment of F-MEL cells induces a marked increase in Bcl-XL expression suggesting a role for this anti-apoptotic protein in the process of erythroid differentiation in F-MEL cells. Moreover, induction of Bcl-XL during this process seems to be associated with loss of proliferative capacity rather than with haemoglobin synthesis.","['Hafid-Medheb, K', 'Poindessous-Jazat, V', 'Augery-Bourget, Y', 'Hanania, N', 'Robert-Lezenes, J']","['Hafid-Medheb K', 'Poindessous-Jazat V', 'Augery-Bourget Y', 'Hanania N', 'Robert-Lezenes J']","['INSERM U268; Hopital Paul Brousse; 94800, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400466 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1999 Feb;6(2):166-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400466.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report herein that CGP 57148, a selective inhibitor of the ABL tyrosine kinase, caused apoptosis specifically in bcr - abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, K562 and KYO-1. Upon treatment with CGP 57148, CRKL, a specific substrate for BCR - ABL that propagates signals via phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase (PI3K), was dephosphorylated, indicating inhibition of BCR - ABL tyrosine kinase at the cellular level. Likewise, MAPK/ERK, a downstream mediator of Ras, was also dephosphorylated.

To investigate possible consequences of wild-type p53 loss in leukemia, we studied the effect of a single dose of gamma irradiation upon p53-deficient human T-ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) CCRF - CEM cells. Exposure to 3 - 96 Gy caused p53-independent cell death in a dose and time-dependent fashion. By electron microscopic and other criteria, this cell death was classified as apoptosis. At low to intermediate levels of irradiation, apoptosis was preceded by accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell division cycle. Expression of Bcl-2 and Bax were not detectably altered after irradiation. Expression of the temperature sensitive mouse p53 V135 mutant induced apoptosis on its own but only slightly increased the sensitivity of CCRF - CEM cells to gamma irradiation. Thus, in these, and perhaps other leukemia cells, a p53- and Bcl-2/Bax-independent mechanism is operative that efficiently senses irradiation effects and translates this signal into arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis.","['Strasser-Wozak, E M', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Geley, S', 'Sgonc, R', 'Bock, G', 'AJ Santos', 'Hattmannstorfer, R', 'Wolf, H', 'Pavelka, M', 'Kofler, R']","['Strasser-Wozak EM', 'Hartmann BL', 'Geley S', 'Sgonc R', 'Bock G', 'AJ Santos', 'Hattmannstorfer R', 'Wolf H', 'Pavelka M', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck Medical School, A-6020, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'G2 Phase', 'Gamma Rays', 'Mitosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400402 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1998 Aug;5(8):687-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that p53 upregulates Fas/APO-1 and Bax expression. Both irradiation and ara-C treatment resulted in apoptosis and induction of p53 proteins within hours. The Bax gene was activated in irradiated and ara-C-treated BV173 cells, but Fas/APO-1 was induced only in irradiated BV173 cells. Radiation and ara-C treatment did not induce Bax or Fas/APO-1 protein expression in p53-null HL60 cells. Radiation weakly induced Fas/APO-1 expression in KBM-7 cells, which harbor a partially defective p53 gene. Both HL60 and KBM-7 cells are more resistant to radiation- and ara-C-induced apoptosis than BV173 cells. These results suggest that functional p53 is necessary for the activation of Bax and Fas/APO-1 expression. However, elevated p53 protein is not sufficient to activate Fas/APO-1 gene expression in ara-C-treated cells. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that the p53 proteins in irradiated and ara-C-treated BV173 cells have different isoelectric points; they converged to a single isoelectric point after in vitro treatment with phosphatase. These results suggest that different genotoxic treatments cause different phosphorylations of p53, which may account for the different levels of activation of Fas/APO-1 expression.","['Kobayashi, T', 'Ruan, S', 'Jabbur, J R', 'Consoli, U', 'Clodi, K', 'Shiku, H', 'Owen-Schaub, L B', 'Andreeff, M', 'Reed, J C', 'Zhang, W']","['Kobayashi T', 'Ruan S', 'Jabbur JR', 'Consoli U', 'Clodi K', 'Shiku H', 'Owen-Schaub LB', 'Andreeff M', 'Reed JC', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67987/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'fas Receptor/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400382 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1998 Jul;5(7):584-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400382.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these cell lines, only the most resistant L1210/DDP10 was cross-resistant to etoposide and deficient in apoptosis induced by these two drugs, indicating that resistance to DNA-damaging agents correlates with a defect in apoptosis. This defect was tightly associated with the loss of a Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent nuclear endonuclease activity present in the less cisplatin-resistant cells. Evidence is presented that p53-dependent function (a) is lost not only in the apoptosis defective L1210/DDP10 cells, but also in the apoptosis susceptible L1210/DDP5 cells; (b) is unrelated to drug-induced cell cycle perturbations.

Here we evaluated the response to IR of two subclones of the autonomous human erythromyeloblastic cell line TF-1: TF-1-34 (which expresses CD34) and TF-1-33 (which lacks CD34). In clonogenic assays, TF-1-34 cells were found to be relatively less sensitive to IR compared to TF-1-33 cells based on the D0 determination (3.01 vs 1.56 Gy). Furthermore, after IR at 12 Gy, TF-1-33 cell viability decreased by approximately 50% within 24 h, whereas TF-1-34 cell growth was unaffected during this time. Gradual loss of TF-1-34 cell viability was observed only after 48 h. Morphological and molecular analysis revealed that TF-1-33 cells died of apoptosis, and TF-1-34 cells of delayed reproductive cell death. While IR produced comparable amounts of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in both cell lines, TF-1-34 retained DSB much longer than TF-1-33 suggesting that radioresistance and the defective apoptotic response of TF-1-34 cells was not related to a higher DNA repair capacity. However, the lack of an apoptotic response in TF-1-34 was correlated to the absence of a sphingomyelin (SM)-ceramide (CER) signaling pathway. Indeed, IR triggered in TF-1-33 cells but not in TF-1-34, SM hydrolysis (25% at 12 Gy) and CER generation (>50%) through the activation of neutral but not acid sphingomyelinase. Synthetic cell permeate CER induced apoptosis in both TF-1-33 and TF-1-34 cells. This study indicates that alterations of the SM-CER signaling pathway can significantly influence the cell death process as well as the survival of acute myeloid leukemia cells after IR exposure.","['Bruno, A P', 'Laurent, G', 'Averbeck, D', 'Demur, C', 'Bonnet, J', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Levade, T', 'Jaffrezou, J P']","['Bruno AP', 'Laurent G', 'Averbeck D', 'Demur C', 'Bonnet J', 'Bettaieb A', 'Levade T', 'Jaffrezou JP']","['CJF INSERM 9503, Centre Claudius Regaud, Toulouse Cedex 31052, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Ceramides)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites', 'Apoptosis/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Cycle/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/physiology/radiation effects', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/enzymology/radiation effects']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400330 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1998 Feb;5(2):172-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400330.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that this high level sensitivity is p53-dependent, associated with very low level expression of Bcl-2 protein and can be reversed by expression of a bcl-2 transgene. We show here that transition from the pro-B to pre-B and then mature B cell stages of murine lymphopoiesis is accompanied by changes in proliferating cells in sensitivity to X-irradiation induced apoptosis and that this is paralleled by variation in the ratio of anti-(Bcl-2/Bcl-chiL) to pro-(Bax) apoptotic proteins. These are however not fixed or invariant features of developmental stage as they can be modulated by interactions via adhesive interactions with stromal cells, stromal proteins and growth factors.

Our previous studies indicate that bryostatin 1 (Bryo 1) induces differentiation of WSU-CLL and increases the ratio of dCK/5'-NT activity and Bax/Bcl-2. This study tests the hypothesis that Bryo 1-differentiated cells are more susceptible to Flud than the parent WSU-CLL cells. Flud, given sequentially after Bryo 1, in vitro and in vivo animal studies resulted in significantly higher rates of growth inhibition and improved animal survival. Flud at 100 to 600 nM exhibited a dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect on the WSU-CLL cell line. The sequential exposure to Bryo 1 (10 nM for 72 h) followed by Flud (100 nM) resulted in significantly higher rates of growth inhibition than either the reverse addition of these two agents or each agent alone, but was not significantly different than the concurrent addition of Bryo 1 + Flud. Using 7-amino-actinomycin D staining and flow cytometry, apoptosis was seen in 40.8% of cells treated with Bryo 1 (10 nM, 72 h) followed by Flud, compared with Flud (100 nM, 72 h) followed by Bryo 1 (18.1%). To demonstrate that Bryo 1 enhancement of Flud efficacy was not restricted to in vitro culture, we used the WSU-CLL xenograft model in mice with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). Bryo 1 + Flud at the maximum tolerated doses (75 microg/kg i.p. and 200 mg/kg i.v., respectively) were administered to mice in different combinations. The survival in days, the tumor growth inhibition ratio (T/C), the tumor growth delay (T-C) in days, log10 kill, as well as mean tumor weight (mtw) of mice treated with Bryo 1 followed by Flud, were significantly better than control and other groups. T/C%, T-C, log10 kill and mtw were as follows: Bryo 1 (36.8%, 10 days, 0.8, 375 mg); Flud (100%, 0. 0 day, 0.0, 1130 mg); Bryo 1 + Flud (14.3%, 12 days, 0.95, 288 mg); Bryo 1 followed by Flud (4.6%, 17 days, 1.35, 35 mg); Flud followed by Bryo (40.3%, 10 days, 0.80, 175 mg). We conclude that: i) Bryo 1 sensitizes WSU-CLL cells to Flud and enhances apoptosis; ii) the sequential treatment with Bryo 1 followed by Flud resulted in higher anti-tumor activity compared with either agent alone, in combination, or the reverse addition of these agents and iii) these results are comparable to those of Bryo 1 followed by 2-CdA suggesting common pathway(s) of interaction between Bryo 1 and purine analogues.","['Mohammad, R M', 'Limvarapuss, C', 'Hamdy, N', 'Dutcher, B S', 'Beck, F W', 'Wall, N R', 'Al-Katib, A M']","['Mohammad RM', 'Limvarapuss C', 'Hamdy N', 'Dutcher BS', 'Beck FW', 'Wall NR', 'Al-Katib AM']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Lande Medical Research Building, Room 317, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['1801CA79837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA22453-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lactones/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.14.5.945 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1999 May;14(5):945-50. doi: 10.3892/ijo.14.5.945.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether transcriptional regulatory mechanisms account for the synaptic accumulation of AChE transcripts at the mammalian neuromuscular synapse, we cloned a 5.3-kb DNA fragment that contained the 5' regulatory region of the rat AChE gene and generated several constructs in which AChE promoter fragments were placed upstream of the reporter gene lacZ and a nuclear localization signal (nls). Using a recently described transient expression assay system in intact skeletal muscle, we show that this AChE promoter fragment directs the synapse-specific expression of the reporter gene. Deletion analysis revealed that a 499-bp fragment located in the first intron of the AChE gene is essential for expression in muscle fibers. Further analysis showed that sequences contained within this intronic fragment were (i) functionally independent of position and orientation and (ii) inactive in hematopoietic cells. Disruption of an N-box motif located within this DNA fragment reduced by more than 80% the expression of the reporter gene in muscle fibers. In contrast, mutation of an adjacent CArG element had no effect on nlsLacZ expression. Taken together, these results indicate that a muscle-specific enhancer is present within the first intron of the AChE gene and that an intronic N-box is essential for the regulation of AChE along skeletal muscle fibers.","['Chan, R Y', 'Boudreau-Lariviere, C', 'Angus, L M', 'Mankal, F A', 'Jasmin, B J']","['Chan RY', 'Boudreau-Lariviere C', 'Angus LM', 'Mankal FA', 'Jasmin BJ']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', '*Introns', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/*enzymology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*enzymology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Synapses/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.8.4627 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Apr 13;96(8):4627-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.8.4627.,PMC16383,,,,['GENBANK/AF134349'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the crystal structure at 2.5-A resolution of the ectodomain of gp21, the TM from human T cell leukemia virus type 1. The gp21 fragment was crystallized as a maltose-binding protein chimera, and the maltose-binding protein domain was used to solve the initial phases by the method of molecular replacement. The structure of gp21 comprises an N-terminal trimeric coiled coil, an adjacent disulfide-bonded loop that stabilizes a chain reversal, and a C-terminal sequence structurally distinct from HIV type 1/simian immunodeficiency virus gp41 that packs against the coil in an extended antiparallel fashion. Comparison of the gp21 structure with the structures of other retroviral TMs contrasts the conserved nature of the coiled coil-forming region and adjacent disulfide-bonded loop with the variable nature of the C-terminal ectodomain segment. The structure points to these features having evolved to enable the dual roles of retroviral TMs: conserved fusion function and an ability to anchor diverse surface-exposed subunit structures to the virion envelope and infected cell surface. The structure of gp21 implies that the N-terminal fusion peptide is in close proximity to the C-terminal transmembrane domain and likely represents a postfusion conformation.","['Kobe, B', 'Center, R J', 'Kemp, B E', 'Poumbourios, P']","['Kobe B', 'Center RJ', 'Kemp BE', 'Poumbourios P']","[""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, 41 Victoria Parade, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Maltose-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Computer Graphics', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray/methods', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Maltose-Binding Proteins', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/04/14 00:00,1999/04/14 00:01,['1999/04/14 00:00'],"['1999/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.8.4319 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Apr 13;96(8):4319-24. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.8.4319.,PMC16330,,,,['PDB/1MG1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A live attenuated varicella vaccine was developed in Japan. It has been reported that the varicella vaccine is safe and highly protective against severe varicella in children with leukemia and other malignancies. It is important to investigate the persistence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immunity in patients with malignancies who have been immunized with varicella vaccine. METHODS: Sixteen patients with malignancies and 11 controls had been immunized with attenuated live varicella vaccine. The duration from vaccination to the study ranged from 2 to 16 years (mean 10 years). Nineteen patients and 20 controls had experienced natural varicella infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and controls were cultured with VZV antigen for 6 days and the percentage of cluster of differentiation antigen (CD)25 among CD4 lymphocytes was calculated by flow cytometry. CONTROLS: The percentage of CD25-positive cells among CD4 lymphocytes significantly increased in response to the VZV antigen in vaccinated patients and patients with past natural varicella infection as observed in the controls.

IgE molecules that did not support HrHRF-induced histamine release were termed IgE-. However, subsequently we demonstrated that HrHRF primes anti-IgE-antibody-induced histamine release from all basophils, irrespective of the type of IgE on the cell surface. OBJECTIVE: Because these data suggested that HrHRF does not exert its biologic effects by binding to IgE, but rather that it interacted with a surface receptor on the basophil, we wanted to obtain functional evidence that HrHRF did or did not bind to the IgE molecule. METHODS: The rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-SX38), which has been transfected to express a functional human FcepsilonRI (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-chains of the receptor) in addition to the normal rat FcepsilonRI, was used. The presence of the human FcepsilonRI receptor enables these cells to be sensitized with human IgE. Cells were passively sensitized with 1000 ng/mL human IgE+ or 1000 ng/mL human IgE- for 60 minutes at 37 degrees C. Unsensitized cells served as a control. After the cells were washed, 1 x l0(5) cells were stimulated in the presence of 1 mmol/L Ca2+ with 0.1 microg/mL anti-IgE, 40 microg/mL HrHRF, or 40 microg/mL mouse recombinant HRF (MrHRF), which has 96% homology to HrHRF. RESULTS: Mean anti-IgE-induced histamine release was 33% +/- 15%, and there was no difference between IgE+ sensitization (32% +/- 12%) and IgE- sensitization (34% +/- 18%). However, in contrast to human basophil experiments, neither HrHRF (0% +/- 0%) nor MrHRF (3% +/- 5%) caused histamine release in RBL cells sensitized with IgE+. In addition, priming the transfected RBL-SX38 cells or the parental cell line, RBL-2H3 cells, with HrHRF or MrHRF did not increase anti-IgE-induced histamine release. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that HrHRF does not bind to IgE, either IgE+ or IgE-. Therefore it appears likely that rHRF signals through its own specific receptor, which is not expressed or functional on RBL-SX38 or RBL-2H3 cells, but which seems to be expressed on basophils of atopic and nonatopic donors.","['Wantke, F', 'MacGlashan, D W', 'Langdon, J M', 'MacDonald, S M']","['Wantke F', 'MacGlashan DW', 'Langdon JM', 'MacDonald SM']","['Johns Hopkins Asthma & Allergy Center, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI 20253/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 32651/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Basophils/immunology/*metabolism', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1']",1999/04/13 00:00,1999/04/13 00:01,['1999/04/13 00:00'],"['1999/04/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0091-6749(99)70237-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70237-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1999 Apr;103(4):642-8. doi: 10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70237-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis is controlled by suppressing or inducing genes, such as bcl-2 and p53, respectively. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess apoptosis of eosinophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes in bronchial biopsy specimens from asthmatic subjects and to examine its regulation by evaluating the expression of B-cell lymphoma leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and P53 proteins. We also sought to explore the relationships between cell apoptosis and GM-CSF, a cytokine able to increase eosinophil and macrophage survival. METHODS: Apoptosis in eosinophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes was evaluated in bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from 30 asthmatic subjects, 26 subjects with chronic bronchitis, and 15 control subjects by combining the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dNTP nick end-labeling technique and immunohistochemistry. The expression of P53, Bcl-2, and GM-CSF was studied through immunohistochemistry by using specific mAbs. RESULTS: The number of apoptotic eosinophils and macrophages was lower in subjects with asthma than in those with chronic bronchitis (P <.007 and P <.001, respectively) and inversely correlated with the clinical severity of asthma (P <.001 and P <.002, respectively). Few T lymphocytes were apoptotic in all groups studied. In asthma GM-CSF+ cells correlated with the number of nonapoptotic eosinophils and macrophages (P =.0001) and with the severity of the disease (P <.003). In asthma Bcl-2+ cells were higher than in control subjects and subjects with chronic bronchitis (P <.002 and P <.015, respectively), they outnumbered P53+ cells, and they correlated with the number of T lymphocytes (P <.001) and with the severity of the disease (P <.003).

Western ligand blots Western immunoblots using a new anti-IGFBP-6 and a new IGFBP-rP1 (related protein-1 antibody and immunoassays (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX) were used to characterize and measure IGFBP-6, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-rP1 in children with ALL at diagnosis, and with treatment. Comparisons at baseline were made with 11 children with meningitis and 11 children with febrile convulsions (controls).

The role of the IGFBPs and IGFBP-rPs in central nervous system acute leukemia remain to be further elucidated.","['How, H K', 'Yeoh, A', 'Quah, T C', 'Oh, Y', 'Rosenfeld, R G', 'Lee, K O']","['How HK', 'Yeoh A', 'Quah TC', 'Oh Y', 'Rosenfeld RG', 'Lee KO']","['Department of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['CA-58110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-51513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1999/04/13 00:00,1999/04/13 00:01,['1999/04/13 00:00'],"['1999/04/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.84.4.5587 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1999 Apr;84(4):1283-7. doi: 10.1210/jcem.84.4.5587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect was inhibited by RGDS and was also not seen on FN-lacking substratum. The extended cytoplasm had swollen terminals and nodes, which contained GpIIb and beta-thromboglobulin, occasionally included alpha granules, and tended to form particles (2-5 microm) after rupture of the narrowed cytoplasm. Among other protein kinase modulators tested, only K252a promoted the elongation, while calphostin, herbimycin, TPA, and calyculin suppressed it. The cells began to migrate soon after addition of stp, with attachment to the substratum held at some sites during the migration. This tethered movement seemed to cause the cytoplasmic elongation and the rupture into particles. The elongation was retarded by pretreating the cells with cytochalasin A and Clostridium C3 toxin but not with demecolcine. Actin microfilaments in the stp-treated Meg-01 cells accumulated in the filopodia and periphery of the extended cytoplasm, in which vinculin was colocalized as adhesion plaques. The microtubules were longitudinally oriented through the cytoplasmic extension and showed no ring profile in the nodes and particles. Thus, stp in the presence of FN appears to stimulate reorganization of actin-based cytoskeleton and formation of focal contacts in Meg-01 cells. This leads to the activation of cell adhesion and motility, and then cytoplasmic elongation and rupture into particles.","['Yamazaki, Y', 'Sanokawa, R', 'Fujita, Y', 'Zhou, D', 'Kawasaki, K', 'Tanaka, H', 'Komatsu, T', 'Nagasawa, T', 'Oka, S']","['Yamazaki Y', 'Sanokawa R', 'Fujita Y', 'Zhou D', 'Kawasaki K', 'Tanaka H', 'Komatsu T', 'Nagasawa T', 'Oka S']","['National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. yamazaki@nibh.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Cytochalasins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '14110-64-6 (cytochalasin A)', 'AC6UDA2MFC (arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cytochalasins/pharmacology', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/13 02:08,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/13 02:08'],"['1999/04/13 02:08 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/13 02:08 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199905)179:2<179::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199905)179:2<179::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-R [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1999 May;179(2):179-92. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199905)179:2<179::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of medullary blast cells and the karyotype at diagnosis are the most important predictors of survival. Patients with more than 10% blast cells or an unfavourable karyotype (chromosome 7 abnormalities or complex aberrations) usually survive less than 12 months. This review article focuses on the roles of intensive AML-type chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in the management of patients with advanced MDS. Recent studies suggest that, with appropriate selection of patients, intensive chemotherapy produces high rates of complete remission. Chances of entering remission are particularly high in patients with a good Karnofsky score, bone marrow blast count < 30% and normal karyotype. When compared with acute myeloid leukemia, results of autologous bone marrow transplantation in MDS are disappointing. A major disadvantage of this approach is the delayed recovery of hematopoiesis. Autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation overcomes this difficulty and is currently explored as consolidation therapy after successful remission induction with polychemotherapy in an intergroup study of the EORTC and EBMT. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains the treatment of choice for younger MDS patients, offering a good chance of cure if the transplantation is performed at an early stage of disease or if the patient receives the transplant in complete remission after conventional chemotherapy.","['Aul, C', 'Germing, U', 'Minning, H', 'Kobbe, G', 'Gattermann, N', 'Sudhoff, T', 'Meckenstock, G', 'Sohngen, D', 'Heyll, A']","['Aul C', 'Germing U', 'Minning H', 'Kobbe G', 'Gattermann N', 'Sudhoff T', 'Meckenstock G', 'Sohngen D', 'Heyll A']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Praxis (Bern 1994),Praxis,101468093,,IM,"['Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*therapy']",1999/04/13 00:00,1999/04/13 00:01,['1999/04/13 00:00'],"['1999/04/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Praxis (Bern 1994). 1999 Mar 4;88(10):431-8.,,36,,,,Stellenwert aggressiver Behandlungsstrategien im Therapiekonzept myelodysplastischer Syndrome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, the PFAA profile in patients with acute leukemias is less well defined. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the PFAA profile is altered in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whether the profile differs from the PFAA profile of solid tumors, and whether it may predict outcome of AML. Fasting PFAA were measured in 40 untreated, normally nourished patients with AML (17 males, 23 females), ages 22-78 y, with white blood cell (WBC) counts ranging from 1.08 to 276.5 x 10(3)/cm2, and in 24 healthy volunteers.

Such changes were unrelated to age, sex, and WBC count. Changes in PFAA that occur in AML are only in part similar to those observed in solid tumors. The reduction of TAU appears to be a typical feature of AML and might be secondary to the deficiency of its precursors SER and MET. Further studies are under way aimed at clarifying whether PFAA might predict prognosis in AML, whether PFAA is normalized by remission induction, and if its correction may be of any benefit for patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Muscaritoli, M', 'Conversano, L', 'Petti, M C', 'Torelli, G F', 'Cascino, A', 'Mecarocci, S', 'Annicchiarico, M A', 'Rossi Fanelli, F']","['Muscaritoli M', 'Conversano L', 'Petti MC', 'Torelli GF', 'Cascino A', 'Mecarocci S', 'Annicchiarico MA', 'Rossi Fanelli F']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. muscaritoli@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Taurine/blood', 'Tryptophan/blood']",1999/04/13 02:07,2000/03/11 09:00,['1999/04/13 02:07'],"['1999/04/13 02:07 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/13 02:07 [entrez]']","['S0899900798001798 [pii]', '10.1016/s0899-9007(98)00179-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutrition. 1999 Mar;15(3):195-9. doi: 10.1016/s0899-9007(98)00179-8.,,,,,,,,,,,['Nutrition 1999 Nov-Dec;15(11-12):828'],,,,,,,,

A lower frequency of hyperdiploidy (15%) in children and a higher frequency of hypodiploidy both in children (38.4%) and adults (44.4%) were found, in contrast to literature. Translocations were detected in one third of adult and pediatric cases. The incidence of t(9;22) was comparatively low in adults (7.7%). Frequency of t(1:19) was also low in overall ALL cases. Various other recurrent abnormalities such as del(6q), abn(11q23), i(9p), abn(12q13), del(7q), and i(17q) were seen in our cases; a striking difference in the incidence of del(6q) (41%) and abn(11q23) (30%) was found in our series versus reported literature. Ploidy distribution indicated association of pseudo- and hypodiploidy with B-lineage, and hypodiploidy with T-lineage in children.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with a chromosome 7-specific painting probe confirmed the composition of the abnormal chromosome. A YAC clone hybridizing to the MDR1 locus confirmed that this gene was located within the duplicated region of the derivative chromosome. With a panel of well-characterized YAC clones, the duplicated segment was found to be a direct tandem duplication, somewhat larger than estimated by conventional cytogenetics. The proximal and distal breakpoints of the abnormality were located and a YAC clone spanning the distal breakpoint was identified.

Co-transfection with an AP2 expression vector stimulated the enhancer activity of nt -520 to -420 element eight-fold compared with that using parental vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of AP2 sites showed that two AP2 motifs are essential for enhancer activity in HeLa cells. These results suggest that AP2 plays a critical role in the epithelium-cell specific transcriptional regulation of the hST3Gal IV gene.","['Taniguchi, A', 'Matsumoto, K']","['Taniguchi A', 'Matsumoto K']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University, 2-2-1, Miyama, Funabashi, Chiba, 274-8510, Japan. taniaki@phar.toho-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.4 (beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/*enzymology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sialyltransferases/*genetics', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/13 00:00,1999/04/13 00:01,['1999/04/13 00:00'],"['1999/04/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(99)90509-0 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1999.0509 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Apr 13;257(2):516-22. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0509.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

The induction by LPS was inhibited by the anti-CD14 antibodies or by the synthetic lipid A precursor (compound 406). An alkali-treated LPS or compound 506 partially inhibited the LPS-induced IL-6 production.

Redistribution of chemoattractant receptors to the anterior pole of a polarized neutrophil could impose asymmetric sensitivity by increasing the relative strength of detected signals at the cell's leading edge. Previous experiments have produced contradictory observations with respect to receptor location in moving neutrophils. To visualize a chemoattractant receptor directly during chemotaxis, we expressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged receptor for a complement component, C5a, in a leukemia cell line, PLB-985. Differentiated PLB-985 cells, like neutrophils, adhere, spread, and polarize in response to a uniform concentration of chemoattractant, and orient and crawl toward a micropipette containing chemoattractant. Recorded in living cells, fluorescence of the tagged receptor, C5aR-GFP, shows no apparent increase anywhere on the plasma membrane of polarized and moving cells, even at the leading edge. During chemotaxis, however, some cells do exhibit increased amounts of highly folded plasma membrane at the leading edge, as detected by a fluorescent probe for membrane lipids; this is accompanied by an apparent increase of C5aR-GFP fluorescence, which is directly proportional to the accumulation of plasma membrane. Thus neutrophils do not actively concentrate chemoattractant receptors at the leading edge during chemotaxis, although asymmetrical distribution of membrane may enrich receptor number, relative to adjacent cytoplasmic volume, at the anterior pole of some polarized cells. This enrichment could help to maintain persistent migration in a shallow gradient of chemoattractant.","['Servant, G', 'Weiner, O D', 'Neptune, E R', 'Sedat, J W', 'Bourne, H R']","['Servant G', 'Weiner OD', 'Neptune ER', 'Sedat JW', 'Bourne HR']","['Departments of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['R37 GM027800/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-25101/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-27800/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM025101/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM027800/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Polarity', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/*physiology', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology/physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Peptide/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.10.4.1163 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1999 Apr;10(4):1163-78. doi: 10.1091/mbc.10.4.1163.,PMC25243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two methods of management of acute GVHD used in two different centers were compared: group I included 62 patients who had 'standard' management of GVHD including prophylaxis with 1-3 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine and treatment with 2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone when acute GVHD developed; group II included 114 patients who received 'intensive' management of GVHD including prophylaxis with 5 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine and treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone (8-20 mg/kg/day for 3 days) at the onset of GVHD. The overall incidence of GVHD was the same in both groups. However, acute GVHD was more severe in group I than in group II (P < 0.0001), with consequently less resolution of GVHD after treatment in group I (61%) than in group II (80%) (P = 0.06). Overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) did not differ between the two groups. However, actuarial risk of disease relapse was significantly higher in group II than in group I (36% vs 17%, P = 0.02). In a multivariate analysis taking into account known factors influencing GVHD and relapse, only type of GVHD management and age were significantly predictive for the occurrence of GVHD, while only type of GVHD management and pathology other than chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were predictive for relapse. This study demonstrates that intensity of GVHD prophylaxis and therapy can influence the graft-versus-leukemia effect by decreasing severity of GVHD but at the price of increasing relapse rate post transplant.","['Michallet, M', 'Perrin, M C', 'Belhabri, A', 'Molina, L', 'Nicolini, F', 'Tigaud, J D', 'Sotto, J J', 'Guyotat, D', 'Fiere, D', 'Archimbaud, E']","['Michallet M', 'Perrin MC', 'Belhabri A', 'Molina L', 'Nicolini F', 'Tigaud JD', 'Sotto JJ', 'Guyotat D', 'Fiere D', 'Archimbaud E']","[""Unite de Greffe de Moelle Osseuse, Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701529 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Jan;23(2):145-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701529.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, BMT donor T cells are not exposed to target antigens of GVT activity until transfer to the host, where tumor antigen presentation may be suboptimal. This study tested in a murine model the hypothesis that immunization of MHC-matched allogeneic donors with a recipient-derived tumor cell vaccine would substantially increase GVT activity and extend survival of BMT recipients with preexisting micrometastatic tumor. C3H.SW and C57BL/10 mice were immunized against a C57BL/6-derived fibrosarcoma or leukemia, and they were used as BMT donors. Recipients were H-2-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched C57BL/6 mice with previously established micrometastatic tumors. Donor immunization led to a significant increase in GVT activity that was T cell dependent and cell dose dependent. In some settings, donor immunization also prolonged survival of recipients with preexisting micrometastatic tumors. However, donor immunization significantly increased the incidence of fatal graft-versus-host disease such that long-term survival was uncommon. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicated that donor immunization induced both tumor-selective and alloreactive cytolytic T-cell populations. In vivo cross-protection assays showed that a substantial portion of the GVT effect was mediated by alloreactive cells not specific for the immunizing tumor. In conclusion, immunization of allogeneic BMT donors with a recipient-derived whole tumor cell vaccine substantially increases GVT activity but also exacerbates graft-versus-host disease.","['Anderson, L D Jr', 'Petropoulos, D', 'Everse, L A', 'Mullen, C A']","['Anderson LD Jr', 'Petropoulos D', 'Everse LA', 'Mullen CA']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Immunization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/04/10 02:04,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/04/10 02:04'],"['1999/04/10 02:04 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 02:04 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Apr 1;59(7):1525-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that the MTAP gene was deleted in over 30% of T-ALL patients at both diagnosis and relapse. We now report that MTAP-primary T-ALL cells are more sensitive to the toxicity of L-alanosine, an inhibitor of de novo AMP synthesis, than are MTAP+ primary T-ALL cells. As measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, DNA synthesis in all seven MTAP-primary T-ALL cells was inhibited by L-alanosine with a mean IC50 of 4.8+/-5.3 ILM (range, 0.3-11.3 microM). On the other hand, the IC50 for 60% (12 of 20) of MTAP+ primary T-ALL was 19+/-18 microM (range, 1.7-67 microM; P = 0.02), whereas the remaining 40% (8 of 20) had an IC50 of >80 microM4.

The protein products of these genes are transcription regulators and are involved in developmental processes, and it seems that the subversion of these normal functions accounts for their role in tumorigenesis. The features of the LMO family of genes, which encode LIM-domain proteins involved in T-cell acute leukemia through chromosomal translocations, typify these abnormal functions in tumorigenesis. For example, the LMO2 protein is involved in the formation of multimeric DNA-binding complexes, which may vary in composition at different stages of hematopoiesis and function to control differentiation of specific lineages. In T cells, enforced expression of Lmo2 causes aberrant protein complex formation that primarily seems to hinder the T-cell differentiation program. These observations underscore the conclusion that protein-protein interaction (in this case, through the LIM domain) is a key determinant in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the study of chromosomal translocations as naturally occurring mutations has been informative about mechanisms in hematopoiesis as well as in tumor etiology.","['Rabbitts, T H', 'Bucher, K', 'Chung, G', 'Grutz, G', 'Warren, A', 'Yamada, Y']","['Rabbitts TH', 'Bucher K', 'Chung G', 'Grutz G', 'Warren A', 'Yamada Y']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Divsion of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Apr 1;59(7 Suppl):1794s-1798s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases, these rearrangements disrupt genes whose normal function is required for the proper development of blood cells. Excellent examples are the chromosomal rearrangements t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(12;21)(p13;q22), and inv(16)(p13q22) that disrupt two of the genes encoding a small family of heterodimeric transcription factors, core-binding factors (CBFs). CBFs consist of a DNA-binding CBFalpha subunit and a non-DNA-binding CBFbeta subunit. The t(8;21), associated with de novo acute myeloid leukemias, disrupts the CBFA2 (AML1) gene, which encodes a DNA-binding CBFalpha subunit. The t(12;21), the most common translocation in pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemias, also disrupts CBFA2. The CBFB gene, which encodes the non-DNA-binding subunit of the CBFs, is disrupted by the inv(16) in de novo acute myeloid leukemias. All chromosomal rearrangements involving the CBFA2 and CBFB genes create chimeric proteins, two of which have been unequivocally demonstrated to function as transdominant negative inhibitors of CBF function. Both the Cbfa2 and Cbfb genes are essential for normal hematopoiesis in mice, because homozygous disruption of either gene blocks definitive hematopoiesis. Recent data suggest that Cbfa2 and Cbfb are required for the emergence of definitive hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo from a putative definitive hemangioblast precursor. The transdominant negative inhibitor of CBF created by the inv(16), when present from the beginning of embryogenesis, also blocks the emergence of definitive hematopoietic cells in the embryo. On the other hand, chromosomal translocations involving the CBFA2 and CBFB genes in leukemias block hematopoiesis at later steps. This may reflect a difference in the timing at which translocations are acquired in the leukemias, which presumably is subsequent to emergence of the definitive hematopoietic stem cell. The cumulative data suggest that although the earliest requirement for Cbfa2 and Cbfb is for emergence of definitive hematopoietic stem cells, both genes are also required at later stages in the differentiation of some hematopoietic lineages.","['Speck, N A', 'Stacy, T', 'Wang, Q', 'North, T', 'Gu, T L', 'Miller, J', 'Binder, M', 'Marin-Padilla, M']","['Speck NA', 'Stacy T', 'Wang Q', 'North T', 'Gu TL', 'Miller J', 'Binder M', 'Marin-Padilla M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA58343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA75611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Apr 1;59(7 Suppl):1789s-1793s.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCL/tal-1, a T-cell basic helix-loop-helix oncoprotein, is required for the formation of all hematopoietic lineages. In addition, it is essential for angiogenesis in the yolk sac, indicating a dual function in blood and vessel development. TEL, an ets-related factor which is translocated to a variety of other genes in leukemias, is also required for proper angiogenesis in the yolk sac.

Both received hepatitis B surface and core antibody positive human leucocyte antigen identical donors' marrow and had serological clearance of HBsAg 15 and 7 weeks after allogeneic BMT, respectively. Both events were preceded by hepatic flare. Both patients were also treated with famciclovir for the prevention of hepatitis B reactivation after BMT. Histological examination during the flare showed only mild necroinflammatory activity with multiple foci of confluent necrosis, associated with moderate lymphocytic infiltration. The majority of these lymphocytes were cluster of differentiation (CD) 8 positive. Using immunohistochemistry, there was no detectable hepatic expression of hepatitis B core antigen. However, HBsAg was positive, mainly in the area of confluent necrosis.

They emphasize the role of promotion, in particular that associated with cell proliferation. There is therefore a qualitative difference between high doses of genotoxic agents which provoke cell death and a compensatory increase in cell division, and low doses which do not. During the promotion phase, human data demonstrate the importance of induced genetic instability and defects in apoptosis as well as that of cell immortalization which play a main role for the accumulation in a cell genome of several specific lesions. Carcinogenesis is a complex process in which initial mutations do not appear to be a limiting or crucial step. This view is supported by the paramount influence of age on the induction by radiation of thyroid and breast cancer. It is also compatible with practical thresholds observed in subjects whose bones or liver were exposed to alpha-emitters, as well as with the curvilinearity in the leukemia incidence dose-response in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The linear no threshold model assumes that: 1) the probability of DNA lesion repair is constant whatever the dose and, hence, the number of lesions provoked in the same cell and the surrounding cells; 2) the probability for a damaged cell to evolve toward an invasive cancer is not influenced by the possible promotional effect of further irradiation or induced tissue proliferation, nor the control exerted by surrounding cells. These assumptions deserve a critical analysis.","['Tubiana, M']",['Tubiana M'],"['Centre Antoine-Beclere, faculte de medecine, Paris, France. tubiana@biomedicale.univ-paris5.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,C R Acad Sci III,"Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.

In this analysis, we detected several unique forms of sequence organization in the U3 regions of the long terminal repeats of these proviruses. The distribution of the proviruses with unique U3 structures demonstrated that xenotropic MLV-related proviruses were present only in M. musculus subspecies, while polytropic MLV-related proviruses were found in both M. musculus and M. spretus. Furthermore, one unique provirus from M. spicelegus was found to be equidistant from ecotropic provirus and nonecotropic provirus by phylogenetic analysis. This provirus, termed HEMV, was thus likely to be related to the common ancestor of these MLVs. Moreover, an ancestral type of polytropic MLV-related provirus was detected in M. spretus species. Despite their ""ancestral"" phylogenetic position, proviruses of these types are not widespread in mice, implying more-recent spread by infection rather than inheritance. These results imply that recent evolution of these proviruses involved alternating periods of replication as virus and residence in the germ line.","['Tomonaga, K', 'Coffin, J M']","['Tomonaga K', 'Coffin JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University, School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],['R35CA44385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'DNA, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Small Nuclear', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.5.4327-4340.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 May;73(5):4327-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.5.4327-4340.1999.,PMC104214,,,,"['GENBANK/AF070719', 'GENBANK/AF070720', 'GENBANK/AF070721', 'GENBANK/AF070722', 'GENBANK/AF070723', 'GENBANK/AF070724', 'GENBANK/AF070725', 'GENBANK/AF070726', 'GENBANK/AF070727', 'GENBANK/AF070728', 'GENBANK/AF070729', 'GENBANK/AF070730', 'GENBANK/AF070731', 'GENBANK/AF070732']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since cellular transformation has been frequently linked to alterations in genome stability, we investigated the effect of Tax on nucleotide excision repair (NER), a prominent cellular DNA repair pathway. Cells expressing Tax exhibited a reduced capacity for NER as measured by unscheduled DNA synthesis and host cell reactivation assays. The cellular proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene product regulates DNA replication and repair pathways, including NER. Since Tax activates transcription of the PCNA promoter, we investigated whether this activity contributes to the reduction of NER. Tax increased endogenous PCNA protein expression, and analysis of Tax mutant proteins demonstrated that the reduction in NER correlated with Tax transactivation of PCNA gene expression. Direct overexpression of PCNA also reduced NER.

For example, the level of expression of the amphotropic receptor Pit-2, a phosphate symporter, appears to be low in human and murine hematopoietic stem cells. We have previously demonstrated that transduction of hematopoietic cells in the presence of the fibronectin (FN) fragment CH-296 is extremely efficient (H. Hanenberg, X. L. Xiao, D. Dilloo, K. Hashino, I. Kato, and D. A. Williams, Nat. Med. 2:876-882, 1996). To examine functionally whether the retrovirus receptor is a limiting factor in transduction of hematopoietic cells, we performed competition experiments in the presence of FN CH-296 with retrovirus vectors pseudotyped with the same or a different envelope protein. We demonstrate in both human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells and primary human CD34(+) hematopoietic cells inhibition of efficient infection due to receptor interference when two vectors targeting the amphotropic receptor are used simultaneously. Receptor interference lasted up to 24 h. No interference was demonstrated when vectors targeting the amphotropic receptor and the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) receptor Pit-1 were used concurrently. In contrast, simultaneous infection with vectors targeting both Pit-1 and Pit-2 yielded transduction efficiencies consistently higher than with either vector alone in both HEL cells and human CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. These data demonstrate that the use of FN CH-296 leads to amphotropic receptor saturation in these cells.

AKR.H-2(b) congenic mice, although carrying the responder H-2(b) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype, are low responders or nonresponders for AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL, apparently due to the presence of inhibitory AKR. H-2(b) cells. Despite their expression of viral antigens and Kb, untreated viable AKR.H-2(b) spleen cells cause dramatic inhibition of the C57BL/6 (B6) antiviral CTL response to in vitro stimulation with AKR/Gross MuLV-induced tumor cells. This inhibition is specific (AKR.H-2(b) modulator spleen cells do not inhibit allogeneic MHC or minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CTL production), dependent on direct contact of AKR.H-2(b) cells in a dose-dependent manner with the responder cell population, and not due to soluble factors. Here, the mechanism of inhibition of the antiviral CTL response is shown to depend on Fas/Fas-ligand interactions, implying an apoptotic effect on B6 responder cells. Although B6.gld (FasL-) responders were as sensitive to inhibition by AKR.H-2(b) modulator cells as were B6 responders, B6.lpr (Fas-) responders were largely insensitive to inhibition, indicating that the responder cells needed to express Fas. A Fas-Ig fusion protein, when added to the in vitro CTL stimulation cultures, relieved the inhibition caused by the AKR.H-2(b) cells if the primed responders were from either B6 or B6.gld mice, indicating that the inhibitory AKR.H-2(b) cells express FasL. Because of the antigen specificity of the inhibition, these results collectively implicate a FasL/Fas interaction mechanism: viral antigen-positive AKR.H-2(b) cells expressing FasL inhibit antiviral T cells (""veto"" them) when the AKR.H-2(b) cells are recognized. Consistent with this model, inhibition by AKR.H-2(b) modulator cells was MHC restricted, and resulted in approximately a 10- to 70-fold decrease in the in vitro expansion of pCTL/CTL. Both CD8(+) CTL and CD4(+) Th responder cells were susceptible to inhibition by FasL+ AKR.H-2(b) inhibitory cells as the basis for inhibition. The CTL response in the presence of inhibitory cells could be restored by several cytokines or agents that have been shown by others to interfere with activation-induced cell death (e.g. , interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-15, transforming growth factor beta, lipopolysaccharide, 9-cis-retinoic acid) but not others (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha). These results raise the possibility that this type of inhibitory mechanism is generalized as a common strategy for retrovirus infected cells to evade immune T-cell recognition.","['Rich, R F', 'Green, W R']","['Rich RF', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*virology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology', 'Tretinoin', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.5.3826-3834.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 May;73(5):3826-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.5.3826-3834.1999.,PMC104160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the expression and the functions of a tagged version of PIT-2 in CHO cells. PIT-2 remained equally abundant at the cell surface within 6 h following variation of the phosphate supply. In contrast, the efficiency of phosphate uptake and retrovirus entry was inversely related to the extracellular phosphate concentration, indicating that PIT-2 activities are modulated by posttranslational modifications of cell surface molecules induced by phosphate. Conformational changes of PIT-2 contribute to both activities, as shown by the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl reagents known as inhibitors of type II cotransporters. A physical association of PIT-2 with actin was demonstrated. Modifications of the actin network were induced by variations of the concentrations of extracellular phosphate, cytochalasin D, or lysophosphatidic acid. They revealed that the formation of actin stress fibers determines the cell surface distribution of PIT-2, the internalization of the receptor in response to virus binding, and the capacity to process retrovirus entry. Thus, the presence of PIT-2 at the cell surface is not sufficient to ensure phosphate transport and susceptibility to amphotropic retrovirus infection. Further activation of cell surface PIT-2 molecules is required for these functions.","['Rodrigues, P', 'Heard, J M']","['Rodrigues P', 'Heard JM']","['Laboratoire Retrovirus et Transfert Genetique, CNRS URA 1157, Institut Pasteur, 75724 Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC20A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'Virion/metabolism']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.5.3789-3799.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 May;73(5):3789-99. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.5.3789-3799.1999.,PMC104156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, directed substitutions for residues in the pocket were introduced and consequences for infection and for receptor binding were measured. Receptor binding was measured initially by a sensitive assay based on coexpression of receptor and RBD in Xenopus oocytes, and the findings were confirmed by using purified proteins. Three residues that are critical for both binding and infection (S84, D86, and W102), with side chains that extend into the pocket, were identified. Moreover, when mCAT-1 was overexpressed, the infectivity of Fr57-MLV carrying pocket substitutions was partially restored. Substitutions for 18 adjacent residues and 11 other previously unexamined surface-exposed residues outside of the RBD pocket had no detectable effect on function. Taken together, these findings support a model in which the RBD pocket interacts directly with mCAT-1 (likely residues, Y235 and E237) and multiple receptor-envelope complexes are required to form the fusion pore.","['Davey, R A', 'Zuo, Y', 'Cunningham, J M']","['Davey RA', 'Zuo Y', 'Cunningham JM']","[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['U01 AI061246/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '2RO1CA/AI61246-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.5.3758-3763.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 May;73(5):3758-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.5.3758-3763.1999.,PMC104153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such persistent viruses can cause chronic diseases or can reactivate to cause acute diseases in AIDS patients or patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies. While the prevention of persistent infections is an important consideration in the design of modern vaccines, surprisingly little is known about this aspect of protection. In the current study, we tested the feasibility of vaccine prevention of retroviral persistence by using a Friend virus model that we recently developed. In this model, persistent virus can be detected at very low levels by immunosuppressing the host to reactivate virus or by transferring persistently infected spleen cells into highly susceptible mice. Two vaccines were analyzed, a recombinant vaccinia virus vector expressing Friend virus envelope protein and a live attenuated Friend virus. Both vaccines reduced pathogenic virus loads to levels undetectable by infectious center assays. However, only the live, attenuated vaccine prevented immunosuppression-induced reactivation of persistent virus. Thus, even very low levels of persistent Friend virus posed a significant threat during immunosuppression. Our results demonstrate that vaccine protection against establishment of retroviral persistence is attainable.","['Dittmer, U', 'Brooks, D M', 'Hasenkrug, K J']","['Dittmer U', 'Brooks DM', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, NIH, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/physiology', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Retroviridae Infections/*prevention & control', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*prevention & control', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology', '*Virus Latency']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.5.3753-3757.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 May;73(5):3753-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.5.3753-3757.1999.,PMC104152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic crosses showed this recessive resistance to be governed by a single gene that maps at or near the gene encoding the polytropic viral receptor, Rmc1. To investigate this resistance, we mated M. castaneus with mice carrying the wild mouse Sxv variant of the Rmc1 receptor that allows infection by xenotropic as well as polytropic virus. Unlike other F1 hybrids of M. castaneus, these F1 mice were resistant to both xenotropic and polytropic classes of MuLVs. Analysis of backcrossed progeny of the F1 hybrids mated to Sxv mice indicates that resistance is due to inheritance of two M. castaneus genes. Cells from individual backcross mice were also examined for cell surface antigen by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with monoclonal antibodies reactive with xenotropic or MCF virus env glycoproteins. A correlation was observed between virus resistance and antigen, suggesting that virus resistance is due to expression of endogenous viral envelope genes that interfere with infection by exogenous virus. Since the inbred strain Rmc1 receptor remains functional in the presence of these M. castaneus genes, and since M. castaneus contains multiple copies of xenotropic MuLV env genes, we suggest that these resistance genes control expression of xenotropic env glycoprotein that interferes with exogenous virus in cells containing the Sxv variant of Rmc1.","['Lyu, M S', 'Nihrane, A', 'Kozak, C A']","['Lyu MS', 'Nihrane A', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20982-0460, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Male', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*immunology/metabolism', 'Muridae/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.5.3733-3736.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 May;73(5):3733-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.5.3733-3736.1999.,PMC104149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have reported the lack of the Src-like protein tyrosine kinase Lck and overexpression of Lyn and Fyn in these cells. In this report we demonstrate that, in addition to the downregulation of TCR, CD45, and Lck (which are key components of T-cell activation), HTLV-1-infected cell lines demonstrate a large increase of FynB, a Fyn isoform usually poorly expressed in T cells. Furthermore, similar to anergic T cells, Fyn is hyperactive in one of these HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, probably as a consequence of Csk downregulation. A second family of two proteins, Zap-70 and Syk, relay the signal of T-cell activation. We demonstrate that in contrast to uninfected T cells, Zap-70 is absent in HTLV-1-infected T cells, whereas Syk is overexpressed. In searching for the mechanism responsible for FynB overexpression and Zap-70 downregulation, we have investigated the ability of the Tax and Rex proteins to modulate Zap-70 expression and the alternative splicing mechanism which gives rise to either FynB or FynT. By using Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the tax and rex genes or inducibly expressing the tax gene, we found that the expression of Rex was necessary to increase fynB expression, suggesting that Rex controls fyn gene splicing. Conversely, with the same Jurkat clones, we found that the expression of Tax but not Rex could downregulate Zap-70 expression. These results suggest that the effect of Tax and Rex must cooperate to deregulate the pathway of T-cell activation in HTLV-1-infected T cells.","['Weil, R', 'Levraud, J P', 'Dodon, M D', 'Bessia, C', 'Hazan, U', 'Kourilsky, P', 'Israel, A']","['Weil R', 'Levraud JP', 'Dodon MD', 'Bessia C', 'Hazan U', 'Kourilsky P', 'Israel A']","[""Unite de Biologie Moleculaire de l'Expression Genique, URA 1773 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France. rweil@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (TYRO3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)']",IM,"['Down-Regulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase', 'src-Family Kinases/*biosynthesis']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.5.3709-3717.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 May;73(5):3709-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.5.3709-3717.1999.,PMC104146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that Cnr2 is a frequent target (12%) for insertion of Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus (MuLV) in primary tumors in NIH/Swiss mice. Multiple provirus insertions in Evi11 were cloned and shown to be located within the 3' untranslated region of the candidate proto-oncogene Cnr2. These results suggest that proviral insertion in the Cnr2 gene is an important step in Cas-Br-M MuLV-induced leukemogenesis in NIH/Swiss mice. To isolate Evi11/Cnr2 collaborating proto-oncogenes, we searched for novel common VISs in the Cas-Br-M MuLV-induced primary tumors and identified a novel frequent common VIS, Evi12 (14%). Interestingly, 54% of the Evi11/Cnr2-rearranged primary tumors contained insertions in Evi12 as well, which suggests cooperative action of the target genes in these two common VISs in leukemogenesis. By interspecific backcross analysis it was shown that Evi12 resides on mouse chromosome 10 in a region that shares homology with human chromosomes 12q and 19p. Sequence analysis demonstrated that Evi12 is located upstream of the gene encoding the molecular chaperone Tra1/Grp94, which was previously mapped to mouse chromosome 10 and human chromosome 12q22-24.

GC boxes are essential for cell cycle-regulated transcription of the cyclin A1 gene.,11220-8,"Cyclin A1 is a recently cloned cyclin with high level expression in meiotic cells in the testis. However, it is also frequently expressed at high levels in acute myeloid leukemia. To elucidate the regulation of cyclin A1 gene expression, we cloned and analyzed the genomic structure of cyclin A1. It consists of 9 exons within 13 kilobase pairs. The TATA-less promoter initiates transcription from several start sites with the majority of transcripts beginning within a 4-base pair stretch. A construct containing a fragment from -190 to +145 showed the highest transcriptional activity. Transfection of cyclin A1 promoter constructs into S2 Drosophila cells demonstrated that Sp1 is essential for the activity of the promoter. Sp1, as well as Sp3, bound to four GC boxes between nucleotides -130 and -80 as observed by gel shift analysis. Mutations in two or more of the four GC boxes decreased promoter activity by >80%. The promoter was found to be cell cycle-regulated with highest activities found in late S and G2/M phase. Further analyses suggested that cell cycle regulation was accomplished by periodic repression of the GC boxes in G1 phase. Taken together, our data show that cyclin A1 promoter activity critically depends on four GC boxes, and members of the Sp1 family appear to be involved in directing expression of cyclin A1 in both a tissue- and cell cycle-specific manner.","['Muller, C', 'Yang, R', 'Beck-von-Peccoz, L', 'Idos, G', 'Verbeek, W', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Muller C', 'Yang R', 'Beck-von-Peccoz L', 'Idos G', 'Verbeek W', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute/UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. muellerc@CSMC.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin A/*genetics', 'Cyclin A1', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.16.11220 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73628-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 16;274(16):11220-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.16.11220.,,,,,['GENBANK/AF124143'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, molecular mechanisms for this induction remain elusive. We therefore developed ACTH-secreting AtT20 transformants for wild-type or mutated STAT3, a cytokine signaling molecule, to address whether STAT3 is a determinant of LIF-mediated ACTH regulation. We show that these mutants act in a dominant negative manner by blocking endogenous STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or STAT3 DNA binding. Attenuation of STAT3 activity in the dominant negative AtT20 clones prevented LIF from promoting transcriptional activation of the POMC promoter (2.1-fold), whereas this LIF action was enhanced (7.7-fold; p < 0.05) in wild-type STAT3-overexpressing clones in comparison to mock-transfected cells (4.5-fold). However, wild-type or dominant negative STAT3-overexpressing clones showed comparable (4-fold) POMC induction after treatment with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an alternate inducer of POMC transcription, indicating the STAT3 specificity for LIF signaling. Moreover, dominant negative inactivation of STAT3 activity resulted in abrogation of LIF-induced POMC mRNA levels and ACTH secretion, confirming the in vivo role of STAT3 in LIF-mediated corticotroph action. Chemical or molecular blockade of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway did not affect LIF-mediated corticotroph function. These results indicate that STAT3 is a critical intrapituitary component of the LIF-mediated neuroimmunoendocrine interface in corticotroph cells.","['Bousquet, C', 'Melmed, S']","['Bousquet C', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['DK33802/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology']",1999/04/10 00:00,1999/04/10 00:01,['1999/04/10 00:00'],"['1999/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.16.10723 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73562-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 16;274(16):10723-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.16.10723.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, we have generated a replication-deficient recombinant adenoviral vector, AdLPLacZ, which contains the human L-plastin (LP) promoter (LP-P) driving the Escherichia coli LacZ gene. LP is constitutively expressed at high levels in malignant epithelial cells but is not expressed in normal tissues, except at low levels in mature hematopoietic cells. Because adenoviral vectors infect early hematopoietic multilineage precursor cells only poorly or not at all, this vector would be of use in the peritoneal cavity and in vitro for marrow purging. We first analyzed the expression of the LacZ reporter gene in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, normal fibroblasts, and leukemia cell lines using the adenoviral vector in which the LacZ gene is governed by the LP-P promoter (AdLPLacZ) or in which the LacZ gene is governed by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (AdCMVLacZ). We found equivalent and high levels of expression of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) by AdLPLacZ and AdCMVLacZ vectors in the breast or ovarian cancer cell lines as well as in a fibrosarcoma cell line, indicating that the adenoviral vectors infected these cells and expressed their transgenes equally with the LP and CMV promoters. Expression of the LacZ gene with the CMV vector but not with the LP-P vector was observed in experiments with normal fibroblasts, indicating that the vectors infected the cells, but that the LP-P was not active within them. In hematopoietic cells such as U937 cells, no measurable beta-gal activity was detected in cells infected either by AdLPLacZ or by AdCMVLacZ, indicating that the adenoviral vectors were not infecting the cells. Although beta-gal activity was observed in fresh ascitic ovarian cancer cells after infection with adenoviral vectors containing CMV or the LP promoters, beta-gal activity was detected in a portion of a biopsy of normal peritoneum when the tissues were exposed to the AdCMVLacZ vector, but not when tissues were exposed to the AdLPLacZ vector. These results suggest that the transcription of therapeutic genes in cells infected by the AdLP vectors would be restricted to LP expression-positive ovarian carcinoma cells but would not be seen in the normal mesothelial cells of the peritoneal cavity. This possibility implies that adenoviral vectors carrying therapeutic genes driven by the LP-P would be of use for the intracavitary treatment ovarian cancer.","['Chung, I', 'Schwartz, P E', 'Crystal, R G', 'Pizzorno, G', 'Leavitt, J', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Chung I', 'Schwartz PE', 'Crystal RG', 'Pizzorno G', 'Leavitt J', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520-8032, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (plastin)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelium/anatomy & histology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Models, Genetic', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700017 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1999 Mar-Apr;6(2):99-106. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, there has been a slight fall in mortality from cancer. METHODS: This paper presents an analysis of trends and patterns in cancer mortality and examines four possible explanations for its recent fall: changes in data collection; cohort effects; competing mortality from other causes of death; and improvements in health care. RESULTS: All contribute to some extent to the observed changes, with each affecting predominantly different age groups. There is evidence of a significant underrecording of cancer deaths among the elderly especially in rural areas and of significant changes in coding practices in the early 1990s. Competing mortality from cardiovascular diseases and accidents can explain some reduction in male deaths from cancer in middle age. Birth cohort effects can explain some reduction among males after early middle age and among females at all ages. The impact of changes in health care are more difficult to identify with certainty but there is evidence of reduced deaths from childhood leukaemia. IMPLICATIONS: Recent changes in mortality in Russia are complex and their understanding will require a multidisciplinary approach embracing demography, epidemiology and health services research.","['Shkolnikov, V M', 'McKee, M', 'Vallin, J', 'Aksel, E', 'Leon, D', 'Chenet, L', 'Mesle, F']","['Shkolnikov VM', 'McKee M', 'Vallin J', 'Aksel E', 'Leon D', 'Chenet L', 'Mesle F']","['Center of Demography and Human Ecology, Institute for Economic Forecasting, Moscow, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Effect Modifier, Epidemiologic', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Risk Factors', 'Russia/epidemiology', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/28.1.19 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1999 Feb;28(1):19-29. doi: 10.1093/ije/28.1.19.,,,,,,,"['IND: RH93199', 'POP: 00284722']",['PIP'],"['*Age Factors', '*Cancer', '*Causes Of Death', '*Cohort Analysis', '*Comparative Studies', '*Data Collection--changes', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developed Countries', 'Diseases', 'Eastern Europe', 'Europe', 'Health Services Evaluation', 'Mortality', '*Mortality Decline--determinants', 'Neoplasms', 'New Independent States', 'Organization And Administration', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Population Dynamics', 'Program Evaluation', 'Programs', '*Quality Of Health Care', 'Research Methodology', 'Russia', '*Sex Factors', 'Studies', 'Ukraine']",['PIP: TJ: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY'],,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of stimulation of adult hematopoiesis by fetal liver hematopoietic cells (FLHC) and to identify the factors involved in the process using a clonal assay system in vitro. The effect of FLHC on the clonal growth of bone marrow cells was studied using a co-culture system consisting of mitomycin C-treated FLHC with 2 x 10(5) bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells. It was observed that FLHC induced a two- to four-fold increase in the BM colony formation. A further increase in the number of FLHC did not, however, result in an equivalent fold increase in the colony formation, indicating that the number of cells in the BM population responsive to FLHC was perhaps the limiting factor. When the effect of fetal liver cell conditioned medium (FLCM) was examined in a similar fashion, it was observed that the FLCM showed a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in the colony formation when used at 1%-5% along with limiting amounts of growth factors. Higher concentrations of conditioned medium resulted in inhibitory responses. One of the principal factors responsible for the stimulatory activity of FLCM was shown to be transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), by a variety of experiments such as its quantitation in FLCM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antibody neutralization, and reconstruction experiments using purified TGF-beta1 and normal medium. In these reconstitution experiments, TGF-beta1 stimulated the colony formation when it was applied at 1-50 pg/ml, but at higher concentration it induced an inhibitory effect, mimicking the behavior earlier seen with FLCM. Our data strongly suggest that one of the mechanisms in stimulation of a recipient's hematopoiesis could be mediated by the action of TGF-beta1 secreted by infused FLHC and could provide a rational framework on which FLI therapy can be further evaluated.","['Kale, V P', 'Limaye, L S']","['Kale VP', 'Limaye LS']","['National Centre for Cell Science, Ganeshkhind, Pune, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Fetus/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Liver/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.170107 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1999;17(2):107-16. doi: 10.1002/stem.170107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A panel of YSFKPMPLaR analogs with systematic substitutions for Lys68 was evaluated for C5a receptor (C5aR) binding affinity and activation in two well-characterized assay systems: human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and human fetal artery. In addition, we determined the activity of these new analogs in transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells in which the Glu at position 199 of the C5aR (wtGlu199) was replaced by a Gln (C5aR-Gln199) or a Lys (C5aR-Lys199). Our results indicated that Lys68 in YSFKPMPLaR plays an important role in binding the C5aR expressed on PMNs and RBL cells. Furthermore, the data indicated that Lys68 interacted with Glu199 of the C5aR in PMNs and RBL cells. In human fetal artery, however, Lys68 substitutions had little or no effect on activity, which suggested that the receptor conformation may be different in this tissue. Thus, the interaction between Lys68 of the decapeptide agonist and Glu199 of the C5aR may be cell type-specific and may form the molecular basis for tissue-specific responses to C5a agonists.","['Vogen, S M', 'Finch, A M', 'Wadi, S K', 'Thatcher, J', 'Monk, P N', 'Taylor, S M', 'Sanderson, S D']","['Vogen SM', 'Finch AM', 'Wadi SK', 'Thatcher J', 'Monk PN', 'Taylor SM', 'Sanderson SD']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-6805, USA.']",['eng'],['CA35727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Denmark,J Pept Res,The journal of peptide research : official journal of the American Peptide Society,9707067,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (complement C5a, (65-74), Tyr(65)-Phe(67)-Pro(69,71)-Ala(73)-)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement C5a/*agonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-3011.1999.tb01612.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Res. 1999 Jan;53(1):8-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3011.1999.tb01612.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated integration of HHV-6 in these cell lines. Only one integrated site of viral DNA was detected in metaphase chromosome spreads, and it was preferentially located at the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q44).

This study was designed to determine the HTLV-I serostatus of mothers of patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and to assess the association of age of exposure and disease outcome. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of the HTLV-I serostatus of mothers of HTLV-I-seropositive patients with ATL and HAM/TSP, 36 living mothers of patients with ATL and 15 mothers of patients with TSP/HAM were traced and enrolled. RESULTS: Five of the 15 (33%) mothers of patients with HAM/TSP and 35 of the 36 (97.2%) mothers of patients with ATL were HTLV-I-seropositive. All patients were breast-fed and none received blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that infection with HTLV-I in early childhood can lead to ATL in later life, and that HAM/TSP can also result from early infection but more commonly results from infection acquired in adulthood. There are several reports of posttransfusion HAM/TSP, but ATL has not been reported following blood transfusion except in patients who were immunocompromised. Because the newborn infant is considered to be immunoincompetent, it seems that this is a necessary factor for the development of ATL after infection.","['Bartholomew, C', 'Jack, N', 'Edwards, J', 'Charles, W', 'Corbin, D', 'Cleghorn, F R', 'Blattner, W A']","['Bartholomew C', 'Jack N', 'Edwards J', 'Charles W', 'Corbin D', 'Cleghorn FR', 'Blattner WA']","['University of the West Indies, Department of Medicine, Port of Spain, Trinidad.']",['eng'],['N01-CP-61022/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Hum Virol,Journal of human virology,9805755,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mothers', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*virology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Hum Virol. 1998 May-Jun;1(4):302-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of MAP on cell morphology, cell cycle phase distribution and changes in polyamine metabolism of xenografted MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human mammary tumor cells were also investigated. On the basis of IC50 values, BHT-101 human thyroid carcinoma cells were the most sensitive (9 micrograms/ml), followed by P388 mouse lymphoma (32 micrograms/ml), MCF-7 (48 micrograms/ml) and MDA-MB-231 (110 micrograms/ml) human breast carcinoma cell lines. MAP treatment led to accumulation of P388 cells in G1 phase. At higher doses, the cytoplasm of the cells became vacuolated followed by apoptosis. The foamy cytoplasm may suggest a rare type of cell death (Clarke III type) called non-apoptotic programmed cell death. MAP treatment resulted in a total inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity with a concomitant decrease of intracellular polyamine (mostly putrescine and spermidine) content in the breast cancer cells, whilst the spermine concentration was shown to increase. MAP proved at least 10 times more potent than the formerly studied DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine making it an attractive candidate for clinical testing.","['Palyi, I', 'Kremmer, T', 'Kalnay, A', 'Turi, G', 'Mihalik, R', 'Bencsik, K', 'Boldizsar, M']","['Palyi I', 'Kremmer T', 'Kalnay A', 'Turi G', 'Mihalik R', 'Bencsik K', 'Boldizsar M']","['Research Center of Oncology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary. palyi@oncol.hu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '81645-70-7 (6-heptyne-2,5-diamine)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Alkynes', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diamines/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199901000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1999 Jan;10(1):103-11. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199901000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the contribution of cytotoxic effector mechanisms, which are mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Fas ligand (FasL), or perforin, to GVHD and GVL effect in a murine BMT model. Bone marrow cells plus spleen cells (BMS) from wild-type, FasL-defective, or perforin-deficient donors were transferred into lethally irradiated recipients in the parent (C57BL/6) to F1 (C57BL/6 x DBA/2) BMT model with or without prior inoculation of DBA/2 leukemia L1210 or P815 mast cytoma cells. The effect of anti-TNF-alpha antibody administration was also examined. Whereas the defect or blockade of each cytotoxic pathway could ameliorate lethal acute GVHD, the GVL effect was differentially affected. The wild-type BMS recipients died of acute GVHD within 50 days without residual leukemia cells. The FasL-defective BMS recipients showed 60%< survival over 80 days without acute GVHD or residual leukemia cells. Administration of anti-TNF-alpha antibody resulted in early leukemia relapse and the recipients died within 25 days with massive leukemia infiltration in the liver. The perforin-deficient BMS recipients died within 60 days with residual leukemia cells.

We describe here the purification and mass spectrometric identification of a 155-kD tyrosine phosphorylated protein associated with src homologous and collagen gene (SHC) from p210(bcr/abl)-expressing hematopoietic cells as SHIP2, a recently reported, unique SH2-domain-containing protein closely related to phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase SHIP. In addition to an N-terminal SH2 domain and a central catalytic region, SHIP2 (like SHIP1) possesses both potential PTB(NPXY) and SH3 domain (PXXP) binding motifs. Thus, two unique 5-ptases with striking structural homology are coexpressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Stimulation of human hematopoietic growth factor responsive cell lines with stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) demonstrate the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 and its resulting association with SHC. This finding suggests that SHIP2, like that reported for SHIP1 previously, is linked to downstream signaling events after activation of hematopoietic growth factor receptors. However, using antibodies specific to these two proteins, we demonstrate that, whereas SHIP1 and SHIP2 selectively hydrolyze PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vitro, only SHIP1 hydrolyzes soluble Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Such an enzymatic difference raises the possibility that SHIP1 and SHIP2 may serve different functions. Preliminary binding studies using lysates from p210(bcr/abl)-expressing cells indicate that both Ptyr SHIP2 and Ptyr SHIP1 bind to the PTB domain of SHC but not to its SH2 domain. Interestingly, SHIP2 was found to selectively bind to the SH3 domain of ABL, whereas SHIP1 selectively binds to the SH3 domain of Src. Furthermore, in contrast to SHIP1, SHIP2 did not bind to either the N-terminal or C-terminal SH3 domains of GRB2. These observations suggest (1) that SHIP1 and SHIP2 may have a different hierarchy of binding SH3 containing proteins and therefore may modulate different signaling pathways and/or localize to different cellular compartments and (2) that they may be substrates for tyrosine phosphorylation by different tyrosine kinases. Because recent evidence has clearly implicated both PI(3,4, 5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 in growth factor-mediated signaling, our finding that both SHIP1 and SHIP2 are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in CML primary hematopoietic progenitor cells may thus have important implications in p210(bcr/abl)-mediated myeloid expansion.","['Wisniewski, D', 'Strife, A', 'Swendeman, S', 'Erdjument-Bromage, H', 'Geromanos, S', 'Kavanaugh, W M', 'Tempst, P', 'Clarkson, B']","['Wisniewski D', 'Strife A', 'Swendeman S', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Geromanos S', 'Kavanaugh WM', 'Tempst P', 'Clarkson B']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics Program and Molecular Biology Program, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Collagen/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*src Homology Domains']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48957-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 15;93(8):2707-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant correlation between high BAX expression and an increased probability of relapse (P <.05 by the log rank test), suggesting that chemosensitivity in leukemic blasts may be regulated by factors that override the BCL-2 pathway.","['Hogarth, L A', 'Hall, A G']","['Hogarth LA', 'Hall AG']","['The LRF Molecular Pharmacology Specialist Programme, Cancer Research Unit, Medical School, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48953-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 15;93(8):2671-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 180- and 70-kD proteins have been previously shown to be IRS2 and the Epo receptor. In this report, we show that the 116-kD protein is the IRS2-related molecular adapter, GAB1. Indeed, Epo induced the transient tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB1 in UT-7 cells. Both kinetics and Epo dose-response experiments showed that GAB1 tyrosine phosphorylation was a direct consequence of Epo receptor activation. After tyrosine phosphorylation, GAB1 associated with the PI 3-kinase, the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP2, the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 5-phosphatase SHIP, and the molecular adapter SHC. GAB1 was also associated with the molecular adapter GRB2 in unstimulated cells, and this association dramatically increased after Epo stimulation. Thus, GAB1 could be a scaffold protein able to couple the Epo receptor activation with the stimulation of several intracellular signaling pathways. Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB1 was also observed in normal human erythroid progenitors isolated from cord blood. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and thrombopoietin (TPO) also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB1 in UT-7 cells, indicating that this molecule participates in the signal transduction of several cytokine receptors.","['Lecoq-Lafon, C', 'Verdier, F', 'Fichelson, S', 'Chretien, S', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Lacombe, C', 'Mayeux, P']","['Lecoq-Lafon C', 'Verdier F', 'Fichelson S', 'Chretien S', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Lacombe C', 'Mayeux P']","['Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire (ICGM), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM U363), France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (GAB1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48943-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 15;93(8):2578-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distinct requirement of factors for proliferation coincides with the differential temporal expression of the subunits of cytokine receptors during early stem cell differentiation. In this study, we explored the underlying mechanism of the requirement of costimulation in a hematopoietic progenitor cell line TF-1. We found that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) optimally activated proliferation of TF-1 cells regardless of the presence or absence of stem cell factor (SCF). However, interleukin-5 (IL-5) alone sustained survival of TF-1 cells and required costimulation of SCF for optimal proliferation. The synergistic effect of SCF was partly due to its anti-apoptosis activity. Overexpression of the IL-5 receptor alpha subunit (IL5Ralpha) in TF-1 cells by genetic selection or retroviral infection also resumed optimal proliferation due to correction of the defect in apoptosis suppression. Exogenous expression of an oncogenic anti-apoptosis protein, Bcl-2, conferred on TF-1 cells an IL-5-dependent phenotype. In summary, our data suggested SCF costimulation is only necessary when the expression level of IL5Ralpha is low and apoptosis suppression is defective in the signal transduction of IL-5. Expression of Bcl-2 proteins released the growth restriction of the progenitor cells and may be implicated in leukemia formation.","['Huang, H M', 'Li, J C', 'Hsieh, Y C', 'Yang-Yen, H F', 'Yen, J J']","['Huang HM', 'Li JC', 'Hsieh YC', 'Yang-Yen HF', 'Yen JJ']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Transfection']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48942-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 15;93(8):2569-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus was detected in 12% of Japanese blood donors. The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence and clinical influence of TTV in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. Sera from 25 BMT recipients obtained 6 to 12 weeks after the transplant were examined for TTV-DNA by the seminested polymerase chain reaction. Serial samples were additionally analyzed in patients with TTV-DNA. Fifteen of 25 recipients (60%) were positive for TTV-DNA after transplant, whereas it was detected in only two of 20 BMT donors (10%). In patients positive for TTV-DNA before BMT, the amount of TTV-DNA decreased to an undetectable level during the myelosuppressed period after BMT. We also found that there was a novel group of TTV, G3, classified by the nucleotide sequences. The median peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 135.0 IU/L and 116.5 IU/L (normal range, 4 to 36 IU/L) in TTV-positive and TTV-negative recipients, respectively. In one of the seven TTV-positive patients who developed hepatic injury (ALT > 150 IU/L), a serial change in the serum TTV titer showed a good correlation with the ALT level. We concluded that (1) the prevalence of TTV is high in BMT recipients, (2) TTV might be replicated mainly in hematopoietic cells, (3) transfusion-transmitted TTV may cause persistent infection, (4) a novel genetic group of TTV, G3, was discovered, and (5) TTV does not seem to frequently cause hepatic injury, although one patient was strongly suggested to have TTV-induced hepatitis.","['Kanda, Y', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Kami, M', 'Saito, T', 'Asai, T', 'Izutsu, K', 'Yuji, K', 'Ogawa, S', 'Honda, H', 'Mitani, K', 'Chiba, S', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Kanda Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Kami M', 'Saito T', 'Asai T', 'Izutsu K', 'Yuji K', 'Ogawa S', 'Honda H', 'Mitani K', 'Chiba S', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine and the Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Transfusion', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Viruses/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Sequence Alignment']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48932-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 15;93(8):2485-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been considered to be potentially synergistic with ATRA in this regard. Accordingly, we randomized 215 patients with newly diagnosed AML (153 patients) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB] or RAEB-t, 62 patients) to receive fludarabine + ara-C + idarubicin (FAI) alone, FAI + ATRA, FAI + G-CSF, or FAI + ATRA + G-CSF. Eligibility required one of the following: age over 71 years, a history of abnormal blood counts before M.D. Anderson (MDA) presentation, secondary AML/MDS, failure to respond to one prior course of chemotherapy given outside MDA, or abnormal renal or hepatic function. For the two treatment arms containing ATRA, ATRA was given 2 days (day-2) before beginning and continued for 3 days after completion of FAI. For the two treatment arms including G-CSF, G-CSF began on day-1 and continued until neutrophil recovery. Patients with white blood cell (WBC) counts >50,000/microL began ATRA on day 1 and G-CSF on day 2. Events (death, failure to achieve complete remission [CR], or relapse from CR) have occurred in 77% of the 215 patients. Reflecting the poor prognosis of the patients entered, the CR rate was only 51%, median event-free survival (EFS) time once in CR was 36 weeks, and median survival time was 28 weeks. A Cox regression analysis indicated that, after accounting for patient prognostic variables, none of the three adjuvant treatment combinations (FAI + ATRA, FAI + G, FAI + ATRA + G) affected survival, EFS, or EFS once in CR compared with FAI. Similarly, there were no significant effects of either ATRA ignoring G-CSF, or of G-CSF ignoring ATRA. As previously found, a diagnosis of RAEB or RAEB-t rather than AML was insignificant. There were no indications that the effect of ATRA differed according to cytogenetic group, diagnosis (AML or MDS), or treatment schedule. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, after accounting for prognosis, addition of G-CSF +/- ATRA to FAI improved CR rate versus either FAI or FAI + ATRA, but G-CSF had no effect on the other outcomes. We conclude that addition of ATRA +/- G-CSF to FAI had no effect on CR rate, survival, EFS, or EFS in CR in poor prognosis, newly diagnosed AML or high-risk MDS.","['Estey, E H', 'Thall, P F', 'Pierce, S', 'Cortes, J', 'Beran, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Keating, M J', 'Andreeff, M', 'Freireich, E']","['Estey EH', 'Thall PF', 'Pierce S', 'Cortes J', 'Beran M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ', 'Andreeff M', 'Freireich E']","['Department of Leukemia, Division of Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. eestey@odin.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",1999/04/09 00:00,1999/04/09 00:01,['1999/04/09 00:00'],"['1999/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48931-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 15;93(8):2478-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a study of priming filgrastim followed by cladribine and then filgrastim again to determine if filgrastim would lead to a reduction of neutropenia and febrile episodes. Thirty-five patients received filgrastim and cladribine and were compared with 105 historic controls treated with cladribine alone. Cladribine was administered at 0.1 mg/kg/d by continuous infusion for 7 days. Filgrastim was administered at 5 micrograms/kg/d subcutaneously on days -3, -2, and -1 and then again after the completion of cladribine until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was >/=2 x 10(9)/L on 2 consecutive days (days +8, +9, etc). After filgrastim priming, the median ANC increased from 0.9 x 10(9)/L to 2.26 x 10(9)/L (2.5-fold increase), and after cladribine, the median nadir ANC in the filgrastim-treated group was 0.53 x 10(9)/L compared with 0.29 x 10(9)/L among historic controls (P =. 04). The median number of days to an ANC greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/L was 9 days in the filgrastim-treated group versus 22 days among historic controls (P < 10(-5)). The percentage of febrile patients, number of febrile days, and frequency of admissions for antibiotics were not statistically different in the two groups. Filgrastim regularly increases the ANC in patients with HCL and shortens the duration of severe neutropenia after cladribine. This phase II study, with comparison to historical controls, failed to detect any clinical advantage from the use of filgrastim and cladribine in the treatment of HCL. Accordingly, the routine adjunctive use of filgrastim with cladribine in the treatment of HCL cannot be recommended.","['Saven, A', 'Burian, C', 'Adusumalli, J', 'Koziol, J A']","['Saven A', 'Burian C', 'Adusumalli J', 'Koziol JA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Ida M. and Cecil H.

The patient was in complete remission; he had persistent lymphopenia and CD4+ T lymphocytopenia. Diagnosis was complicated by the chronic and subacute nature of symptoms; some originally thought to be secondary to depression and chemotherapy related toxicity. Treatment was further complicated by the unusual phenomenon of paradoxical progression of disease while on appropriate therapy. This case illustrates the importance of consideration of mycobacteriosis in the differential diagnosis of chronic unexplained fever complicating treatment for acute leukemia. The natural history and essential aspects of diagnosis and treatment of CNS tuberculosis are reviewed.

These cells showed typical characteristics of apoptosis, when they were cultured at 32 degrees C. In this process, p53 recovered the wild-type p53 function and the expression of the p21 (waf1/cip1/sdi1), cyclin G1 and gadd45 genes was increased. However, no significant changes were detected in the expression of the mdm2, bcl-2, bax, fas and fasl genes, suggesting the existence of other genes associated with apoptosis. Genes up-regulated by p53 were screened by the mRNA differential display method. One of the up-regulated genes was identified as the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) gene. EF-1 alpha is also a microtubule-severing protein. Upon the temperature-shift, the cells developed the morphology and the localization of alpha-tubulin similar to those of the cells treated with vincristine, a drug that affects microtubules. The microtubule-severing associated with up-regulation of EF-1 alpha by p53 may be a cause of the cell death. On the other hand, the function of cyclin G1 is not so clear despite the fact that 1-2-3 cells showed a significant increase of the cyclin G1 gene during the early stage of apoptosis. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify cyclin G1-associated proteins. One is a cytochrome c (Cyt c) oxidase subunit II (COXII). Cyclin G1 and COXII were co-immunoprecipitated from an extract of human osteosarcoma cell line that expressed high levels of cyclin G1. COX activity was also increased by temperature-shift in this cell line. The pattern of changes in COX activity was closely reflected by the expression of the cyclin G1 gene. Cyclin G1 and COXII associate physically with each other in vivo and that activation of COXII by binding to cyclin G1 upregulated by p53 may be associated with apoptosis. These two new pathways, p53-EF-1 alpha-microtubule-severing (-distortion of cytoskeleton) and p53-cyclin G1-COXII (-CytC, ATP-caspase-3 activation), may cooperate to induce apoptosis in this cell line.","['Kato, M V']",['Kato MV'],"['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Tsukuba Life Science Center, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan. mkato@rtc.riken.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CCNG1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccng1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin G)', '0 (Cyclin G1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death/genetics/physiology', 'Cyclin G', 'Cyclin G1', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'Peptide Elongation Factors/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909093740 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Mar;33(1-2):181-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199909093740.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve patients fulfilled Galton's original clinical and hematological criteria, presented with prominent splenomegaly and hyperleukocytosis and showed rapid progression soon after diagnosis. Twelve cases with gradually increasing spleen size and prolymphocyte count had an indolent course. Seven of this group are alive 68 to 164 months after diagnosis, whereas five died from causes unrelated to PLL. Eleven patients who never developed impressive leukocytosis had a variable prognosis. In the group of 17 patients treated with chlorambucil and prednisone (CP) or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone (COP) 8 achieved a partial remission (PR) with a median response of 32 months. In the group of six cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) treated patients one achieved a complete remission and two PR (median response was maintained for 30 months). Three patients treated with 2CdA achieved good PR. Six patients remained untreated. Median survival was 65 months and the probability of overall survival for 3, 5, and 10 years was 63%, 56% and 35%, respectively. Anemia < 11 g/dl and lymphocytosis > 100 x 10(9)/l were predictors of shorter survival in this group of patients. Age over 70, gender, B-symptoms at presentation, spleen size, thrombocytopenia, low IgG and complement levels, presence of paraproteinemia and the pattern of bone marrow infiltrate were not significant. Our findings show that all B-PLL may not have such a poor prognosis as described in earlier reports. The existence of prior symptoms evolving gradually after years to obvious PLL and cases with mild prolymphocytosis could possibly lead to underdiagnosis of the entity. Identification and follow-up of such cases may suggest a different natural history, variable prognostic features and different survival curves for B-PLL patients. In the light of the above, we suggest that the therapeutic approach for B-PLL should always relate to the severity of the disease.","['Shvidel, L', 'Shtalrid, M', 'Bassous, L', 'Klepfish, A', 'Vorst, E', 'Berrebi, A']","['Shvidel L', 'Shtalrid M', 'Bassous L', 'Klepfish A', 'Vorst E', 'Berrebi A']","['Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Hebrew University Medical School and Hadassah, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*diagnosis/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/diagnosis', 'Survival Rate']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909093739 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Mar;33(1-2):169-79. doi: 10.3109/10428199909093739.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have here extended these findings by testing the activity of loxoribine in combination with fludarabine and mafosfamide. As we have previously demonstrated, loxoribine enhances the activity of fludarabine at all concentrations, while only lower doses of mafosfamide seem to be positively affected by loxoribine. The combination of fludarabine and mafosfamide is synergistic on CLL cells, and the cytotoxic activity is increased by the addition of loxoribine. We have also evaluated the pro-apoptotic activity of each drug, both alone and in combination; these results are concordant with the cytotoxicity data, thus demonstrating that, even though loxoribine is more active in combination with fludarabine than with mafosfamide, the efficacy of the triple combination is higher than that obtained with any other agent alone or in double combination.","['Pellacani, A', 'Tosi, P', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Albertini, P', 'Magagnoli, M', 'Tura, S']","['Pellacani A', 'Tosi P', 'Zinzani PL', 'Ottaviani E', 'Albertini P', 'Magagnoli M', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9CAS0V66OI (loxoribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Guanosine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909093736 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Mar;33(1-2):147-53. doi: 10.3109/10428199909093736.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the systemic administration of TNF for malignancy results in poor response and severe toxicity, future efforts should concentrate on local treatment. Here we examined the suppressive effect of TNF alpha on leukemic cells engrafted in scid mice. NALM6 cells derived from pre-B ALL were injected in scid mice subcutaneously with or without Matrigel. In mice with Matrigel, subcutaneous tumors rapidly increased with time, whereas none of the mice without Matrigel showed any obvious signs of disease or apparent tumors. High levels of leukemic infiltration were observed in peripheral organs in mice with Matrigel by flow cytometry and PCR for human beta-actin mRNA expression, while mice without Matrigel showed low or undetectable infiltration in these organs. Human TNF alpha was also coinjected subcutaneously with NALM6 cells and Matrigel into scid mice. Mice with 10 ng of TNF alpha showed small subcutaneous tumors at 8 weeks, which slowly increased. They were found to have a small number of leukemic cells in peripheral organs by flow cytometry. By PCR, all organs with the exception of lung and brain showed low or undetectable expression of beta-actin. However, a large dose of TNF alpha (100 ng) had no suppressive effect on tumor growth and leukemic infiltration in mouse organs. Similar results were obtained in colony formation of leukemic cells in vitro. To examine the mechanism of the suppressive effect of TNF alpha, the expression of TNF receptors in tumor cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Parental NALM6 expressed both TNF alpha receptors I (TNFR60) and II (TNFR80), but these expressions were suppressed in tumor cells from mice with Matrigel. Only TNFR80 expression was induced in tumor cells of mice with 10 ng of TNF alpha. The induction of Fas expression was also detected, whereas neither DNA fragmentation nor apoptotic change in histology was observed in tumor cells of mice with TNF alpha. These results suggest that the suppressive effect of TNF alpha on the growth of leukemic cells in scid mice is mediated through the activation of TNFR80 without apoptotic signal.","['Yoshida, N', 'Ishii, E', 'Mohri, S', 'Nagumo, F', 'Yoshidomi, S', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Yoshida N', 'Ishii E', 'Mohri S', 'Nagumo F', 'Yoshidomi S', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Collagen/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis', 'Laminin/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteoglycans/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909093731 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Mar;33(1-2):107-18. doi: 10.3109/10428199909093731.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The well-described involvement of this ligand-receptor pair in physiological hematopoiesis raised the question whether FL and FLT3 also play a role in the pathobiology of leukemia. Following the early discovery of high receptor expression by myeloid leukemia cells, several investigators have focused their attention on these cells, both primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and continuous human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Regardless of the morphological FAB subtype, the vast majority of AML cases were FLT3-positive both at the mRNA and protein level; among the myeloid cell lines, predominantly the monocytic and myelocytic cell lines were FLT3-positive whereas the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic cell lines were FLT3-negative. Virtually all cell lines studied expressed FL transcripts; the finding that some cell lines displayed both ligand and receptor indicates the possibility of autocrine, intracrine or paracrine stimulatory loops. In vitro growth assays showed that FL caused a proliferative response in a high percentage of AML cases. Only constitutively growth factor-dependent myelocytic cell lines increased their proliferation upon incubation with FL whereas all growth factor-independent cell lines were refractory to FL stimulation. Combinations of FL with various cytokines (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, M-CSF, PIXY-321, SCF) had synergistic or additive mitogenic effects. Finally, FL had significant anti-apoptotic, survival-promoting effects on primary AML cells and myeloid cell lines under serum-free culture conditions. On the strength of the above findings, it can be concluded that the FL-FLT3 signaling system may play a certain, albeit probably not causal role in the development of human leukemias. Dissection of the exact molecular pathways that lead to proliferation and/or anti-apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells as well as the detailed elucidation of the possible contribution of the FL-FLT3 genes to leukemogenesis remain future challenges.","['Drexler, H G', 'Meyer, C', 'Quentmeier, H']","['Drexler HG', 'Meyer C', 'Quentmeier H']",['The DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganism & Cell Cultures Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures Braunschweig. hdr@gbf.de'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199909093728 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Mar;33(1-2):83-91. doi: 10.3109/10428199909093728.,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric neoplasm of vascular origin and perhaps viral etiology. Four forms of KS are known: classic or Mediterranean, endemic or African, posttransplant, and epidemic or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated KS. In its classic form KS mainly affects elderly people and often has a long and indolent course that occasionally allows other malignancies to appear. Previous studies of the possible association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative KS and lymphoproliferative disorders (LDs) have produced discordant results. METHODS: To verify a possibly significant association between HIV negative KS and LDs, data relating to 250 evaluable Italian patients with HIV negative KS were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 250 KS patients, only 6 (2.4%) were found to have had an LD: 2 with Hodgkin lymphoma, 1 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1 with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 1 with acute promyelocytic leukemia, and 1 with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: No significant association was found between HIV negative KS and LDs in the patient population in the current study. The authors believe that age, LD, or therapy-related immunodepression played a role in the cases in which KS appeared after the LD by determining the passing to the lytic phase of the herpes-virus HHV8 already present in anatomic sites of latency/persistence.","['Fossati, S', 'Boneschi, V', 'Ferrucci, S', 'Brambilla, L']","['Fossati S', 'Boneschi V', 'Ferrucci S', 'Brambilla L']","['Institute of Dermatology, State University, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/complications', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*complications', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications']",1999/04/08 02:03,2000/05/08 09:00,['1999/04/08 02:03'],"['1999/04/08 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/08 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990401)85:7<1611::AID-CNCR25>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990401)85:7<1611::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-m [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Apr 1;85(7):1611-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990401)85:7<1611::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-m.,,,['Cancer. 2000 Feb 1;88(3):708-9.

The authors investigated whether IL-2 may improve the duration of complete remission (CR) and survival in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients in first CR. METHODS: Eighteen patients were included after achieving a CR and receiving at least two courses of consolidation chemotherapy. Therapy was comprised of IL-2 4.5 x 10(5) U/m2 daily by continuous infusion (CI) for 12 weeks, plus boluses of 1 x 10(6) U/m2 on Day 8 and weekly thereafter while continuing the CI. No further chemotherapy was given after the administration of IL-2 was started. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 50 years (range, 18-73 years), and 7 patients (39%) had an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD). The median CR duration was 12 months, with 6 patients still alive in CR at a median follow-up of 64 months (range, 50-82 months). Long term CR by cytogenetics occurred in 2 of 5 patients with a normal karyotype (CR duration of 68+ months and 72+ months, respectively), 1 of 3 patients with t(8;21) (CR duration of 82+ months), 1 patient with inv(16) (CR duration of 67+ months), none of 2 patients with -5/-7 (1 patient died in CR after 10 months), 1 of 2 patients with abnormalities in chromosome 11 (CR duration of 60+ months), and 1 of 4 patients with miscellaneous abnormalities (CR duration of 74+ months). The median survival was 47 months. To assess the significance of these results, the authors selected two historic controls receiving long term postremission chemotherapy per each IL-2 case. The controls had remained in CR for at least as long as the cases when the latter underwent treatment initiation with IL-2 and were matched for the number of induction courses required to achieve CR, AHD, cytogenetic abnormalities, and age. Six of 18 IL-2 patients (33%) were alive in CR at 3 years compared with 7 of 36 controls (19%) (P = 0.31). Nine IL-2 patients (50%) were alive at 3 years compared with 10 controls (28%) (P = 0.13).

We investigated responses to neurotensin in human promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells. 2. Neurotensin increased the cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a concentration-dependent manner and also produced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). 3. Among the tested neurotensin analogues, neurotensin 8-13, neuromedin-N, and xenopsin also increased [Ca2+]i, whereas neurotensin 1-11 and neurotensin 1-8 did not elicit detectable responses. 4. SR48692, an antagonist of NTR1 neurotensin receptors, blocked the neurotensin-induced [Ca2+]i increase, whereas levocabastine, which is known as an NTR2 neurotensin receptor antagonist, did not attenuate the neurotensin-evoked effect. 5. The expression of NTR1 neurotensin receptors was confirmed by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 6. During 1.25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-triggered granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, the neurotensin-induced [Ca2+]i rise became gradually smaller and completely disappeared 4 days after treatment with DMSO. The mRNA level for neurotensin receptors was also decreased after differentiation. 7. The results show that HL-60 cells express NTR1 neurotensin receptors and suggest that granulocytic differentiation involves transcriptional regulation of the receptors resulting in down-regulation of the neurotensin-induced signalling.","['Choi, S Y', 'Chae, H D', 'Park, T J', 'Ha, H', 'Kim, K T']","['Choi SY', 'Chae HD', 'Park TJ', 'Ha H', 'Kim KT']","['Department of Life Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Neurotensin)', '146362-70-1 (SR 48692)', '39379-15-2 (Neurotensin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*chemistry/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Neurotensin/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Neurotensin/*analysis']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0702378 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1999 Feb;126(4):1050-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0702378.,PMC1571214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to assess its frequency and potential usefulness as a marker for leukemic cells and to detect potential clinical correlations, 180 adult patients (aged > 15 years) with newly diagnosed acute leukemia including 133 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 47 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were tested for its presence in leukemic blasts at diagnosis by Southern blot technique and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 3 sets of primers (P550, P566, P1400), amplifying the most frequent sites of hypermethylation upstream or within the gene. In AML, 92 patients (69%) had hypermethylation detected by Southern blot at diagnosis. This hypermethylation could be confirmed by PCR in 18 of 36 tested cases (50%). Hypermethylation was not significantly associated to any clinical or hematological characteristic of the disease. In ALL, 44 patients (94%) had hypermethylation detected by Southern blot at diagnosis. This hypermethylation could be confirmed by PCR in 33 of the 43 tested cases (77%).

We here report a very sensitive method for assessing MRD in complete hematological remission (CHR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients as defined by the international workshop on CLL (IWCLL). PATIENTS: Twelve CLL patients in CHR and complete phenotypic remission (CPR) were included in the study. Eight of them received Fludarabine (FDR), one was treated by Chop regimen, and the remaining 3 were rescued by polychemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). METHODS: DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of each patient was amplified with VH family specific and framework 3 primers in 5' and a consensus JH primer in 3', before treatment and sequentially after the CPR completion. When no clonal rearrangement could be detected by this assay, the CDR3 sequence specific probe of the clone was used as the 3' primer, associated to the VH family specific primer in 5'. PCR products were analyzed by classical procedures in agarose and/or acrylamide gels. RESULTS: Mixtures of leukemic cells and normal PBL showed detection of a single leukemic cell among more than 10(5) normal cells. Four out of the 12 patients achieved molecular remission (MR) when employing CDR3 amplification. All 3 autografted patients were in MR, whereas only one out of the 9 patients treated by chemotherapy alone achieved MR. When using a clone specific probe, a clonal signal was observed in all cases but one (ABMT). Results presented here confirm that MR may be achieved in a few cases of B-CLL. Further studies are needed to determine the exact relationship between MRD and clinical outcome.","['Magnac, C', 'Sutton, L', 'Cazin, B', 'Laurent, C', 'Binet, J L', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Dighiero, G', 'Maloum, K']","['Magnac C', 'Sutton L', 'Cazin B', 'Laurent C', 'Binet JL', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Dighiero G', 'Maloum K']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains/*analysis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-999-0013-y [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1999 Feb;41(1):13-8. doi: 10.1007/s00282-999-0013-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENT AND METHODS: All but one patients were mobilized with a combination of chemotherapy (including high-dose cyclophosphamide and VP16 or adriamycin, aracytin with cysplatyl) and recombinant human Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (rhG-CSF). RESULTS: A median of 3 (range, 1 to 9) aphereses yielded 15.35 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range, 4.45 to 70.88). A median of 5.01 x 10(6) adsorbed CD34+ cells/kg (range 2.01 to 24.13) was obtained after selection (median purity: 86%; range, 59-99%). The CD34 PBSC were infused one day after either one of two conditioning regimens: 11 patients received the association of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and TBI (8Gy), and 5 patients received the BEAM regimen. No recombinant hematopoietic growth factor was used after cell reinfusion. Median days to 0.5 x 10(9)/l neutrophils and 50 x 10(9)/l platelets were 13 (range, 9 to 18) and 16 (range, 11 to 35), respectively. The median number of red blood cell (RBC) unit transfusions was 4 (range, 0 to 10). The median number of platelet transfusions was 3.5 (range, 0 to 8).

METHODS: DNA was obtained from archival testicular and bone marrow samples from boys with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed in the testes. Overlapping DJH clone specific primers derived from clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in each case were used to analyse testicular or bone marrow DNA. RESULTS: Histologically normal end of treatment testicular biopsies in the five patients in longterm remission were all MRD negative, but MRD positive in three of six boys with subsequent testicular relapse. Histologically normal bone marrow samples taken at the end of treatment were MRD negative in five of seven cases, but MRD positive in all cases at the time of isolated testicular relapse. Three boys with unilateral testicular relapse underwent unilateral orchidectomy, rather than bilateral testicular irradiation, as part of their treatment. Two of these boys were MRD positive in the histologically uninvolved testes, and both had subsequent relapses either in the testes or the bone marrow, while the MRD negative patient has not had a testicular relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MRD in testicular tissue can be assayed with a PCR based method to detect clone specific antigen receptor gene rearrangements. In this setting, PCR is more sensitive than conventional testicular histology for predicting clinical outcomes. MRD assays might be useful in the management of boys at the time of isolated testicular relapse, to confirm the presence of unilateral testicular disease.","['Lal, A', 'Kwan, E', 'al Mahr, M', 'Zhou, L', 'Ferrara, D', 'Tobias, V', ""O'Gorman Hughes, D"", 'Haber, M', 'Norris, M D', 'Marshall, G M']","['Lal A', 'Kwan E', 'al Mahr M', 'Zhou L', 'Ferrara D', 'Tobias V', ""O'Gorman Hughes D"", 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Marshall GM']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Testis/*pathology']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/mp.51.5.277 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pathol. 1998 Oct;51(5):277-81. doi: 10.1136/mp.51.5.277.,PMC395652,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to clarify the mechanism of EBV-induced NK cell proliferation and its relationship with high incidence of leukaemias or lymphomas in HMB patients, we studied clonally expanded NK cells from three HMB patients and succeeded in establishing an EBV-infected NK-like cell line designated KAI3. Immunoblotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that KAI3 cells as well as infected NK cells exhibited an EBV latent infection type II, where EBV gene expression was limited to EBNA 1 and LMP1. As KAI3 was established by culture with IL-2, IL-2 responsiveness of peripheral blood NK cells from patients was examined. The results represented markedly augmented IL-2-induced IL-2R alpha expression in NK cells. This characteristic property may contribute to the persistent expansion of infected NK cells. However, KAI3 cells as well as the NK cells from patients were not protected from apoptosis induced by either an anti-Fas antibody or NK-sensitive K562 cells. Preserved sensitivity to apoptosis might explain the relatively regulated NK cell numbers in the peripheral blood of the patients. To our knowledge, KAI3 is the first reported NK-like cell line established from patients of severe chronic active EBV infection (SCAEBV) before the onset of leukaemias or lymphomas. KAI3 cells will contribute to the study of EBV persistency in the NK cell environment and its relationship with high incidence of leukaemias or lymphomas in HMB patients.","['Tsuge, I', 'Morishima, T', 'Morita, M', 'Kimura, H', 'Kuzushima, K', 'Matsuoka, H']","['Tsuge I', 'Morishima T', 'Morita M', 'Kimura H', 'Kuzushima K', 'Matsuoka H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Child', 'Culicidae/*immunology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*etiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Insect Bites and Stings/*complications/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Male']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2249.1999.00836.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1999 Mar;115(3):385-92. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1999.00836.x.,PMC1905265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of regions on chromosome 13q containing the BRCA2 and RB1 genes has also been reported in sporadic breast cancers.

Consistent with these observations, a significant depletion of cellular glutathione was observed in ricin-treated cells, and NAC prevented the decrease in cellular glutathione. On the other hand, among the caspase inhibitors tested, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, which inhibited ricin cytotoxicity, also suppressed ricin-mediated glutathione depletion, while NAC did not affect the generation of caspase-3 like activity in ricin-treated cells. These results suggest that glutathione loss takes place downstream from caspase activation during the ricin-induced apoptotic process. Treatment with a specific inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) failed to induce apoptosis, and had no effect on the overall extent of ricin-induced apoptosis, even though the glutathione level was decreased to less than 5% of the control level. However, NAC still protected against ricin-induced apoptosis in the BSO-treated cells. We conclude that glutathione loss is one of several apoptotic changes caused by ricin, but is not a sufficient factor for the progress of apoptosis. NAC may prevent ricin-induced apoptosis through maintaining an intracellular reducing condition by acting as a thiol supplier.","['Oda, T', 'Iwaoka, J', 'Komatsu, N', 'Muramatsu, T']","['Oda T', 'Iwaoka J', 'Komatsu N', 'Muramatsu T']","['Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University, Japan. t-oda@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ricin/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1271/bbb.63.341 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 1999 Feb;63(2):341-8. doi: 10.1271/bbb.63.341.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may be induced by prolonged exposure of cells to drugs such as doxorubicin, etoposide and vinca alkaloids. Once MDR develops in clinical tumors, it is a major obstacle for the improvement of treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Several specific mechanisms have been identified in clinical refractory MM patients including typical MDR, which is associated with P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and Lung Resistance Protein (LRP). The expression of the proteins associated with these genes seems to depend on exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, reversal of MDR by non-cytotoxic agents such as verapamil, cyclosporin A and PSC 833 (Valdospar) was explored in acute leukemia and multiple myeloma. Preliminary results from clinical phase I/II trials indicate that reversal of MDR is possible and that it may lead to alterations of the plasma pharmacokinetics of the cytostatic agents, in addition to P-glycoprotein inhibition in tumor cells. The potential implications of P-glycoprotein reversal are discussed.","['Sonneveld, P']",['Sonneveld P'],"['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Rotterdam Dijkzigt, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,,IM,"['*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy']",1999/04/08 00:00,1999/04/08 00:01,['1999/04/08 00:00'],"['1999/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 1999 Feb;47(2):182-7.,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple myeloma must be differentiated from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma. The plasma cell labeling index and the presence of circulating plasma cells in the peripheral blood are helpful in the differential diagnosis. Plasma cell leukemia, osteosclerotic myeloma (POEMS syndrome), and plasmacytomas are discussed. The heavy-chain diseases consist of alpha, gamma, and mu heavy-chain disease.

These data strongly suggest that alterations of RAR alpha might predispose for myeloid and lymphoid disorders.","['Parrado, A', 'West, R', 'Jordan, D', 'Bastard, C', 'McKenna, S', 'Whittaker, J A', 'Bentley, P', 'White, D', 'Chomienne, C', 'Padua, R A']","['Parrado A', 'West R', 'Jordan D', 'Bastard C', 'McKenna S', 'Whittaker JA', 'Bentley P', 'White D', 'Chomienne C', 'Padua RA']","[""Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics']",1999/04/07 00:00,1999/04/07 00:01,['1999/04/07 00:00'],"['1999/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01240.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Mar;104(4):738-41. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01240.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NB4 cells, radiolabelled with (111)Indium, showed a 2-3-fold increase (P < 0.001) in adhesion to fibronectin and thrombospondin upon RA (3 x 10(-7) microM) treatment, whereas adhesion to collagen I, laminin and vitronectin was not modified. The increase in cell adhesion, observed as early as day 1, preceded cell differentiation and was concomitant with tyrosine phosphorylation events. Using flow cytometry, we analysed the expression of major receptors for fibronectin (alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1) and for thrombospondin (alpha(v)beta3, alpha(IIb)beta3, CD36 and CD47) on NB4 cells before and after RA treatment. Except for alpha(IIb)beta3, which was induced on RA-treated cells, we found no significant increase in the expression of the other receptors, and a decrease in the expression of CD36, upon RA treatment. Preincubation of RA-treated cells with blocking antibodies demonstrated a role for alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 in cell adhesion to fibronectin and alpha5beta1, alpha(IIb)beta3, CD36 and CD47 in cell adhesion to thrombospondin. Experiments with the synthetic peptides GRGDS (0.2 mM) and CSVTCG (0.2 mM) confirmed the participation of integrins, and integrins and CD36, in adhesion of RA-treated cells to fibronectin and thrombospondin, respectively. Further inhibition by heparin (10 microg/ml) and/or recombinant heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin (TSP18) indicated the additional participation of heparin-like receptors in cell adhesion to thrombospondin. Our results indicate that increase in NB4 cell adhesion to fibronectin and thrombospondin upon RA treatment is likely to occur through a modulation of the functional state of several receptors for these proteins.","['Touhami, M', 'Bourge, J F', 'Legrand, C']","['Touhami M', 'Bourge JF', 'Legrand C']","['Proteines Adhesives et Proteases des Cellules Vasculaires et Sanguines, Unite 353 INSERM, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Thrombospondins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Thrombospondins/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/pharmacology']",1999/04/07 00:00,1999/04/07 00:01,['1999/04/07 00:00'],"['1999/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01235.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Mar;104(4):706-14. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01235.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach has several shortcomings (it is only applicable to patients with aberrant phenotypes, requires a diagnostic sample, and is patient-specific) and therefore a search for simpler alternatives is warranted. The present study is based on the hypothesis that in precursor-B-ALL patients the persistence of residual leukaemic cells may induce abnormalities in the precursor-B-cell compartment in bone marrow (BM) and these could be used as a criteria to predict relapse. These abnormalities may include: (1) the presence of an increase in the frequencies of immature B cells (CD34+/CD19+ or CD20-/CD19+) or (2) the existence of an altered B-cell differentiation pathway due to a blockade or to the presence of B cells outside the normal pathway. A total of 180 BM samples from 45 consecutive precursor-B-ALL patients who achieved morphological complete remission (CR) were analysed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Our results show that a significant increase in immature B-cell subsets or an altered B-cell differentiation predicts a high relapse rate (P<0.01) and a shorter disease-free survival (P<0.01). Moreover, abnormalities in either of these two criteria detected at specific time points during follow-up (end of induction, maintenance, or after treatment) were associated with a significantly shorter disease-free survival (P<0.01). In summary, the investigation of abnormalities in B-cell differentiation is a relatively simple and cheap approach for predicting relapse in precursor-B-ALL patients.","['Ciudad, J', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Garcia Marcos, M A', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Vazquez, L', 'del Canizo, M C', 'Lopez, A', 'Van Dongen, J J', 'Orfao, A']","['Ciudad J', 'San Miguel JF', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Garcia Marcos MA', 'Gonzalez M', 'Vazquez L', 'del Canizo MC', 'Lopez A', 'Van Dongen JJ', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio General de Citometria, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",1999/04/07 00:00,1999/04/07 00:01,['1999/04/07 00:00'],"['1999/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01236.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Mar;104(4):695-705. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01236.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study whether relapse is accompanied by genetic alterations, we compared N-ras, p53 and FLT3 gene mutations in paired samples obtained at initial diagnosis and first relapse. 28 patients with relapsed AML were studied, and their duration of complete remission ranged from 133 to 989 d (mean 318 d). Karyotype changes were observed at relapse in 11 patients. Point mutations of the N-ras gene were positive at both stages (+/+) in three patients, positive at initial diagnosis and negative at relapse (+/-) in three patients, and negative at initial diagnosis and positive at relapse (-/+) in two patients. Internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) were +/+ in five patients, +/- in one patient, and -/+ in six patients. The p53 gene mutations were +/+ in two patients, +/- in one patient, and -/- in 25 patients. FLT3/ITD and mutant p53 at relapse were associated with short survival after relapse. These results indicate that relapse is frequently accompanied by molecular alterations that include the loss and/or acquisition of mutations.

PBSC were mobilized by chemotherapy and G-CSF and were collected by leukapheresis on a CS3000 cell separator on 2 consecutive days. The two apheresis products were pooled for CD34 selection. The pooled apheresis products from each patient were divided into two equal portions to be separated on each of the two devices. Cell selection was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Enumeration of CD34+ cells was performed by flow cytometry using the HPCA-2 MAb. Purity and yield were significantly better with Isolex than with CEPRATE. Median purity was 93.0% (range 80%-98%) for Isolex and 61.5% (range 27%-72%) for CEPRATE (p = 0.03); median yields for Isolex and for CEPRATE were 48.0% (range 18%-73%) and 23.0% (range 17%-29%), respectively (p = 0.03).

Thus, the Isolex 300i device gave products of higher purity and recovered a higher proportion of the CD34+ cells in the harvest before separation.

A survey of 742 cases and further characterization of rare CD43+ follicular lymphomas.,488-94,"CD43 expression on B cells is an immunophenotypic feature suggestive of malignancy. In the light of its diagnostic importance, we performed a comprehensive survey of CD43 expression in various types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and determined the frequency of its expression in routinely fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Tissue sections in 742 cases of NHL, pretreated by the heat-induced epitope retrieval technique, were immunostained using an anti-CD43 antibody. Three categories of CD43 positivity were found: (1) more than 90% of T-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma cases were positive; (2) 20% to 40% of nodal and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like B-cell lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma cases were positive; and (3) 0% to 6% of primary splenic MZL and various types of follicular lymphoma cases were positive. Most CD43+ follicular lymphomas were predominantly large cell type with focally diffuse areas; their follicular center cell origin in 4 of 8 cases was supported by the presence of CD10 immunoreactivity and/or t(14;18) fusion gene product. CD43 is frequently detectable in a subset of B-NHL, and, thus, it seems to be a highly sensitive marker for these tumors. CD43 also may be a useful marker for classifying B-cell NHLs by virtue of its differential expression in these tumors.","['Lai, R', 'Weiss, L M', 'Chang, K L', 'Arber, D A']","['Lai R', 'Weiss LM', 'Chang KL', 'Arber DA']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*analysis', 'Tissue Embedding']",1999/04/07 00:00,1999/04/07 00:01,['1999/04/07 00:00'],"['1999/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/111.4.488 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1999 Apr;111(4):488-94. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/111.4.488.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frequently, immunophenotyping identifies myeloid antigen expression in ALL, causing a potential diagnostic problem. To evaluate the immunophenotype of ALL, we studied 210 cases of pediatric and adult ALL by flow cytometry and compared the results with the French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group classification and the karyotypic findings. Myeloid-associated antigens were expressed in 78 (45.6%) of precursor B-cell ALL cases. Pediatric precursor B ALLs had a higher frequency of myeloid antigen expression than did adult cases. All mature B-cell ALL cases were negative for TdT and myeloid antigens. Myeloid antigen expression was less frequent in T-cell ALL cases compared with precursor B-cell ALL cases. Of the 192 cases submitted for cytogenetic analysis, 147 were abnormal. The most common chromosomal translocation was the Philadelphia chromosome, which was more likely to have L2 blast morphology and a precursor B immunophenotype. Myeloid antigen expression was present in 70.8% of Ph-positive cases (P = .008). Chromosome rearrangements involving 11q23 also showed an increased frequency of myeloid antigen expression. Chromosome translocations involving regions of T-cell receptor genes were present in 24% of T-cell ALL cases. A high percentage of ALL cases, however, had various other cytogenetic abnormalities, many of which involved less well-studied chromosomal regions.","['Khalidi, H S', 'Chang, K L', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Brynes, R K', 'Slovak, M L', 'Murata-Collins, J L', 'Arber, D A']","['Khalidi HS', 'Chang KL', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Brynes RK', 'Slovak ML', 'Murata-Collins JL', 'Arber DA']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', '*Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']",1999/04/07 00:00,1999/04/07 00:01,['1999/04/07 00:00'],"['1999/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/111.4.467 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1999 Apr;111(4):467-76. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/111.4.467.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve resolution and to identify errors in the databases, a radiation hybrid breakpoint map was developed for the interval, which included hybrids from both Stanford G3 and GeneBridge 4 panels. This novel approach facilitated the integration of one RH panel with another and enabled the identification and localization of new, previously unmapped ESTs from the radiation hybrid databases. ESTs were assembled into overlapping transcription units and ordered with respect to polymorphic markers in the region, resulting in a comprehensive map that incorporates markers from multiple different types of maps. This map of 5q31 will facilitate gene discovery efforts for several disorders, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1A and the genes deleted in acute myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasia.

We sought to identify parameters that could predict the yield of PBPC after mobilization with chemotherapy (CT) with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in cancer patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients underwent 627 PBPC collections during the recovery phase following CT with (n = 469) or without (n = 142) G-CSF. Hemogram, CFC-assays and CD34+ cell count were performed on peripheral blood and leukaphereses products. After log transformation of the data, differences between groups were assessed with the unpaired t-test or one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Seventeen and two patients required 2 and 3 mobilization cycles respectively to reach our target of 15x10(4) CFU-GM/kg. In patients with lymphoma but not in those with leukemia, the yields of both CFU-GM and CD34+ cells/kg were dramatically increased when G-CSF was added to CT for mobilization. In collections primed with CT and G-CSF, better yields were obtained in patients with breast cancer or small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) as opposed to other solid tumors and leukemia. Among potential predictive factors of CT- and G-CSF-primed harvests, we found that the CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood (PB) was strongly correlated with both the CFU-GM and CD34+ cell yields.

The objective of the present study was to ascertain whether the initial features of CML have changed over time, as well as the possible impact on survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: The initial features of 167 patients diagnosed with chronic phase Ph-positive CML from 1972 to 1985 were compared with those of 174 such patients diagnosed at the same institution from 1985 to 1998. The survival of the two groups was also compared. RESULTS: CML patients diagnosed since 1985 were significantly older at presentation (mean age 47+17 vs 43+17 years, p = 0.04), were more often asymptomatic (36% vs 19%, p = 0.0003), less often had constitutional symptoms (30% vs 45%, p = 0.004), less frequently had splenomegaly (59% vs 75%, p = 0.0008) and hepatomegaly (35% vs 49%, p = 0.01), had less marked leukocytosis (mean WBC count 139+/-124x10(9)/L vs 179+/-132x10(9)/L, p = 0.007), with 30% of them showing an initial WBC count below 50x10(9)/L (vs 19%, p = 0.02), and showed less marrow blast cell infiltration (p = 0.0003). No significant differences were observed in the distribution by Sokal's risk groups. Median survival of patients diagnosed since 1985 was 5. 33 years (95% CI: 4.3-6.36), vs 4.06 years (95% CI: 3.28-4.84) for patients diagnosed before (p = 0.07). Finally, patients asymptomatic at diagnosis had a longer survival (median survival 5.7 years, 95% CI: 4.5-6.9, vs 4.1 years, 95% CI: 3.4-4.7, p = 0.03). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of CML patients are currently diagnosed early in the course of the disease. The effect of earlier diagnosis on survival prolongation in such patients should be taken into account.","['Cervantes, F', 'Hernandez-Boluda, J C', 'Ferrer, A', 'Cid, J', 'Montserrat, E']","['Cervantes F', 'Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Ferrer A', 'Cid J', 'Montserrat E']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Villarroel 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Apr;84(4):324-7.,,,['Haematologica. 1999 Apr;84(4):289-90.

Its current use as front-line therapy of CLL is still a matter of debate both because of the controversial results of the clinical trials so far reported and because of the toxicity profile of the drug. In order to contribute to clarifying the possible role of FAMP, we report a retrospective analysis of the results obtained with the purine analog in CLL patients in different phases of the disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients affected by advanced CLL, 36% untreated, 31.9% relapsed and 31.9% resistant, were treated with FAMP 25 mg/m2/day, either for 4 days every 3 weeks in 29 cases, or for 5 days every 4 weeks in 18. The median number of FAMP cycles was 6 (range 2-11). Response was defined according to total tumor mass (TTM) score reduction and toxicity was expressed according to WHO grading criteria. The median follow-up of the series was 13 months from the beginning of FAMP therapy. RESULTS: Out of 47 evaluable patients the response rate was 74.4%, with 34% complete response (CR). The overall response rate was 94%, 80% and 46.6% in untreated, relapsed and resistant cases, respectively; a significantly higher number of responses was associated with no previous treatment and number of FAMP cycles. Fifty-three percent of all cases and 58.8% of untreated ones did not experience any toxicity. Treatment-related side effects were mainly autoimmune phenomena in untreated patients and infectious complications in treated ones. One heavily pre-treated patient died because of neurologic complications. Median time to re-treatment was18 months (range 1-30) and was influenced by age and previous treatment. The overall median survival was 35.7 months with a significantly higher proportion of surviving cases among RAI 0-II stages, responders and patients receiving more than 5 FAMP cycles. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The present report confirms the high efficacy of FAMP in previously pre-treated cases with acceptable toxicity and encourages its use as front-line treatment provided that the results of randomized trials demonstrate its superiority over conventional chemotherapy. The possible development of autoimmune phenomena should, however, be considered seriously.","['Stelitano, C', 'Morabito, F', 'Kropp, M G', 'Callea, V', 'Iuliano, F', 'Oriana, V', 'Levato, D', 'Nobile, F', 'Molica, S', 'Brugiatelli, M']","['Stelitano C', 'Morabito F', 'Kropp MG', 'Callea V', 'Iuliano F', 'Oriana V', 'Levato D', 'Nobile F', 'Molica S', 'Brugiatelli M']","['Dipartimento di Emato-Oncologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, 89100 Reggio Calabria, Italy. morctmo@tin.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Apr;84(4):317-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As thrombopoietin (TPO) is the main regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, we measured TPO levels in patients with thrombocytosis in an attempt to understand the regulation and potential utility of distinguishing thrombocytoses. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum TPO levels, platelet counts, mean platelet volume, hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and age were evaluated in 25 patients with clonal thrombocytosis (15 with essential thrombocythemia, 6 with polycythemia vera and 4 with chronic myeloid leukemia) and in 50 patients with reactive thrombocytosis distributed in three groups: 1) patients in post-surgical states; 2) patients with solid tumors; and 3) patients with inflammatory diseases. RESULTS: TPO levels were slightly increased in patients with clonal (135+/-50 pg/mL) and reactive (147+/-58 pg/mL) thrombocytosis compared with controls (121+/-58 pg/mL). Analyzing the different groups, patients with essential thrombocythemia had the lowest TPO levels (120+/-28 pg/mL) and patients with solid tumors the highest levels (162+/-59 pg/mL). Patients with clonal thrombocytosis were older, had higher platelet counts, mean platelet volume and hemoglobin, and lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate than patients with reactive thrombocytosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Minor differences were observed in TPO levels between patients with primary and secondary thrombocytoses. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, but not TPO levels, may be a useful tool for discriminating both types of thrombocytoses.","['Espanol, I', 'Hernandez, A', 'Cortes, M', 'Mateo, J', 'Pujol-Moix, N']","['Espanol I', 'Hernandez A', 'Cortes M', 'Mateo J', 'Pujol-Moix N']","[""Departament d'Hematologia, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications', 'Platelet Count', 'Thrombocytosis/*blood/complications', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Apr;84(4):312-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its effects are mediated through two membrane-bound receptors: TNF-R I (p55; CD 120a) and TNF-R II (p75; CD 120b). The aim of our study was to investigate the relative roles of these receptors. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed in 16 acute myeloid leukemia cases whether TNF-alpha could induce in vitro maturation and apoptosis. We then investigated which of the two receptors was provoking monocytic maturation and which was responsible for apoptosis by using the agonistic MoAb HTR-9, directed at CD120a, and the CD120b antagonistic MoAb UTR-1. RESULTS: Monocytic maturation (morphologic and immunologic) was induced in all cases studied, although to different rates, by TNF-alpha and by HTR-9 incubation. The addition of UTR-1 to TNF-alpha did not abolish maturation, nor did it affect apoptosis, which was present in primary AML cultures after 4 and 10 days. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We present here evidence that the sole stimulation of CD 120a, but not of CD120b, by TNF-alpha is responsible for bot monocytic maturation and apoptosis of primary AML blasts.","['Santini, V', 'Gozzini, A', 'Scappini, B', 'Rossi Ferrini, P']","['Santini V', 'Gozzini A', 'Scappini B', 'Rossi Ferrini P']","['Dept. of Hematology, Policlinico di Careggi, viale Morgagni 85, 50134 Florence, Italy. santini@unifi.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD11 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Apr;84(4):291-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cells express Fas antigen and show apoptosis after treatment with an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. We established the ATL cell line KOB, which showed resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis, and found that KOB expressed two forms of Fas mRNA, the normal form and a truncated form. The truncated transcript lacked 20 base pairs at exon 9, resulting in a frame shift and the generation of a premature stop codon at amino acid 239. The same mutation was detected in primary ascitic cells and peripheral blood cells. The mutation was not detected in lymph node cells, however, although all of the primary ATL cells were of the same clonal origin. A retroviral-mediated gene transfer of the truncated Fas to Jurkat cells rendered the cells resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, suggesting a dominant negative interference mechanism. These results indicate that an ATL subclone acquires a Fas mutation in the lymph nodes, enabling the subclone to escape from apoptosis mediated by the Fas/Fas ligand system and proliferate in the body. Mutation of the Fas gene may be one of the mechanisms underlying the progression of ATL.","['Maeda, T', 'Yamada, Y', 'Moriuchi, R', 'Sugahara, K', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Joh, T', 'Atogami, S', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kamihira, S']","['Maeda T', 'Yamada Y', 'Moriuchi R', 'Sugahara K', 'Tsuruda K', 'Joh T', 'Atogami S', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Aichi 464-0221, Japan. tmaeda@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Ascites/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Disease Progression', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*genetics/immunology']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.189.7.1063 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1999 Apr 5;189(7):1063-71. doi: 10.1084/jem.189.7.1063.,PMC2193006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although their mechanisms of action are believed to be distinct, these two drugs both induce the catabolism of the oncogenic promyelocytic leukemia (PML)/RARalpha fusion protein. While APL cell lines resistant to one agent are sensitive to the other, the benefit of combining RA and arsenic in cell culture is controversial, and thus far, no data are available in patients. Using syngenic grafts of leukemic blasts from PML/RARalpha transgenic mice as a model for APL, we demonstrate that arsenic induces apoptosis and modest differentiation, and prolongs mouse survival. Furthermore, combining arsenic with RA accelerates tumor regression through enhanced differentiation and apoptosis. Although RA or arsenic alone only prolongs survival two- to threefold, associating the two drugs leads to tumor clearance after a 9-mo relapse-free period.

The postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 at the thymidine kinase locus was demonstrated for L5178Y (LY)-S1 cells that are deficient in repair of DNA DSBs. Less postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 was observed in LY-R16 and LY-SR1 cells, which are relatively efficient in DSB repair. Postirradiation treatment with WR-1065 had only a small stimulatory effect on DSB rejoining. A 3-h incubation of irradiated LY cells with WR-1065 caused slight changes in the distribution of cells in the phases of the cell cycle that differed between LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells. Both LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells were protected against the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of radiation when WR-1065 was present 30 min before and during the irradiation. We conclude that the differential postirradiation effects of WR-1065 in the LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells are not caused by differences in cellular uptake of the radioprotector or in its radical scavenging activity. Possible mechanisms for the postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 are discussed.","['Evans, H H', 'Horng, M F', 'Ricanati, M', 'McCoy, E C']","['Evans HH', 'Horng MF', 'Ricanati M', 'McCoy EC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4942, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Mercaptoethylamines)', '05P3K9I49L (N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimutagenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Mercaptoethylamines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Apr;151(4):391-7.,,,,,,,,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Radiation Health', 'Non-NASA Center']",,,,,,,['Evans HH'],"['Evans, H H']","['Case Western Res U, Cleveland, OH']",

In each hybridization two different pairs of chromosomes were stained. Defined stage positions of metaphases on a slide were stored on a hard disk and an automatic scan of images according to these positions was performed after six successive hybridizations. In this way we obtained six different images of the same metaphase with differently stained pairs of chromosomes and centromeres. The comparison of these images enabled the identification of mutual exchanges between chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 14, 18 and 22. The frequencies of exchanges were not linearly proportional to the molecular weight of interacting chromosomes. The most significant were exchanges between chromosomes 14/18, 14/8, 18/8, 8/3, 1/14, 1/8, 3/18, 3/14 and 9/22. The results indicate significant interactions between chromosomes involved in translocations in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic myeloid leukemia. We propose that the reason for the high frequency of exchanges between these chromosomes is their proximity in the cell nucleus. It may also be one of the reasons for the induction of specific translocations leading to malignant transformation of cells.","['Lukasova, E', 'Kozubek, S', 'Kozubek, M', 'Kroha, V', 'Mareckova, A', 'Skalnikova, M', 'Bartova, E', 'Slotova, J']","['Lukasova E', 'Kozubek S', 'Kozubek M', 'Kroha V', 'Mareckova A', 'Skalnikova M', 'Bartova E', 'Slotova J']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, Brno.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human/*radiation effects', '*Fast Neutrons', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Male', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Apr;151(4):375-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of proteolysis and especially plasminogen activation is less clear in hematopoietic malignancies than in solid tumors. However, patients with leukemia have an increased tendency to bleeding, not always attributable to thrombocytopenia, and tissue infiltration by leukemic cells, processes in which plasminogen activation may be involved. Several studies have indicated that plasminogen activators (PAs) are highly expressed by cultured leukemia cells. Furthermore, differing from adherent tumor cells, leukemic cells have an enhanced capacity to activate pro-uPA and mainly the active form of uPA is released to culture medium. Ex vivo studies have shown that uPAR, uPA and its inhibitors can be found on the surface of normal blood cells and on the blast cell surfaces from patients with acute leukemia as well as from plasma samples. Elevated levels of PAs and their inhibitors have been detected in leukemic cell lysates. Few studies have tried to demonstrate a correlation between prognosis of leukemia and levels of plasminogen activators. More in vivo studies are needed to show, if any of the factors of the plasminogen activation process can be used as tools in subclassification or as markers for prognosis in leukemia. This review article will focus on the in vivo studies of plasminogen activation in leukemia and will present several in vitro findings on PAs in normal leukocytes and leukemic cell lines.","['Mustjoki, S', 'Alitalo, R', 'Stephens, R W', 'Vaheri, A']","['Mustjoki S', 'Alitalo R', 'Stephens RW', 'Vaheri A']","['Haartman Institute, Department of Virology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Plasminogen/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/*physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1699-0463.1999.tb01537.x [doi]'],ppublish,APMIS. 1999 Jan;107(1):144-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1699-0463.1999.tb01537.x.,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cells, however, although adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels were lower than in the control cells, the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (delta psi m), detected by rhodamine 123 (R123) and diSC3(5) staining, remained unchanged until the final stage of apoptosis. No evidence was obtained to relate this finding to R-PK mutation due to difficulty in cloning stable, conditionally inducible R-PK gene transfectants. However, low delta psi m in the apoptotic cell population of the control T3-K-1 (K-1) and T3-CI-2-0 (2-0) Friend erythroleukemia cells supports a possible relationship, as do results obtained in two Friend erythroleukemia cells recently isolated from normal CBA/N mice.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. All HCL patients diagnosed from 1975 to 1996. SETTING: Haematology clinics of the Universitas and Pelonomi Hospitals in Bloemfontein. SUBJECTS: All HCL patients diagnosed from 1975 to 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To determine the clinical and demographic profile, as well as response to treatment, of HCL patients in this region. RESULTS: A total of 16 HCL patients were studied. There were more males (13) than females and the mean age of the patients was 58 years (35 to 82 year; SD14.8). No Black patients were diagnosed. The patients mostly presented with a cytopenia and splenomegaly was present in 12 of the 14 patients for which spleen size was noted. All of the patients had a splenectomy and six were also treated with 2'-deoxycoformycin (Pentostatin). All six of the patient showed a response to treatment with this purine analogue.

We designed a phase II study to assess the efficacy and side effects of a time sequential application of mitoxantrone plus intermediate-dose Ara-C followed by HDAra-C plus etoposide (GEMIA) in adult patients with refractory or relapsed AML. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with refractory or relapsed AML were eligible for GEMIA salvage therapy, which comprised mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2/day on days 1-3, Ara-C 500 mg/m2/day as a 24-hour continuous infusion on days 1-3, followed by HDAra-C 2 g/m2/12-hourly on days 6-8 and etoposide 100 mg/m2/12-hourly on days 6-8. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was started on day 14. In patients above the age of 55 the dose of Ara-C in the first sequence (days 1-3) was reduced to 250 mg/m2. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included, of whom 12 achieved complete remission after GEMIA (60%, 95% CI 40-80%), one was refractory and five died early from infection. Two additional patients achieved partial remission after GEMIA and complete remission after consolidation chemotherapy, for a final CR rate of 70% (95% CI 48-88%). Neutrophils recovered at a median of 27 days (range, 22-43) and platelets 46 days (range, 25-59) after the start of treatment. The median duration of remission was 133 days (range, 36-417+) whereas overall survival time lasted for a median of 153 days (range, 13-554+). Treatment-associated toxicity was comprised predominantly of infection, mucositis and diarrhea that reached World Health Organization grades III-V in 40%, 40% and 30% of patients, respectively. Despite the intention to rapidly proceed to a hematopoietic stem cell transplant in patients in remission, only five patients reached the transplant. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The GEMIA time sequential chemotherapy regimen appears effective in obtaining remissions in refractory and relapsed adult AML. The high toxicity seen, however, suggests that its design is amenable to further improvements, especially in more elderly patients. Since remissions are short-lived, more innovative post-remission strategies are needed.","['Martino, R', 'Guardia, R', 'Altes, A', 'Sureda, A', 'Brunet, S', 'Sierra, J']","['Martino R', 'Guardia R', 'Altes A', 'Sureda A', 'Brunet S', 'Sierra J']","[""Servei d'Hematologia Clinica, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Av.

RESULTS: Three patients had severe gut complications: 2 cases of enterocolitis and 1 case of gall bladder overdistension in the absence of calculi. In all cases the abnormality was documented by US examination: US scan showed thickening of the intestinal wall (two cases), and gall bladder overdistension with biliary sludge (one case). Immediate medical care included bowel rest, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, antimycotic treatment, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. All patients recovered from the complication. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the favorable outcome obtained in our small series can be attributed to early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has improved the detection of this cytogenetic abnormality and has made detection possible in all phases of the cell cycle. The presence of the trisomy 12 positive (+12) cell population has generally been investigated in leukemic cells obtained from the peripheral blood of CLL patients. To ascertain whether trisomy 12 is expressed homogeneously in cells of different hemopoietic tissues, we applied FISH to lymph node, peripheral blood and bone marrow samples obtained simultaneously from 23 untreated B-CLL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three newly diagnosed patients with B-CLL, 15 in stage B and 8 in stage C, were included in the present study. Peripheral blood smears, bone marrow aspirate smears and lymph node touch imprints were collected from each patient at diagnosis. Cytologic preparations were examined by light microscopy in order to assess the lymphocyte morphology. Immunophenotyping was performed by cytofluorimetric analysis of the peripheral blood, bone marrow and lymph node mononuclear cell suspensions. The diagnosis was supported in all cases by histologic findings in bone marrow biopsy and lymph node biopsy specimens. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on smears of blood and aspirated bone-marrow and lymph node touch imprints obtained by fresh tissue apposition. RESULTS: In 6 of the 23 cases (26%) trisomy 12 was clearly present in all tissues examined. A comparative analysis of the three different hemopoietic tissues was performed. A higher percentage of leukemic CD5+CD23+ cells was detected in lymph nodes than in peripheral blood and bone marrow. A significantly higher proportion of trisomic cells was observed in lymph nodes samples than in peripheral blood or bone marrow smears of trisomy 12 positive CLL patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Several previous reports show that only a proportion of malignant B-CLL cells carry trisomy 12 when analyzed by interphase FISH. The higher proportion of +12 cells in lymph nodes than in peripheral blood or bone marrow of CLL patients with trisomy 12 could reflect different cell distributions in different tissues, or lymph node specific tropism, or proliferative advantage in selected tissue. At present, the role of trisomy 12 in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disorders is unclear.","['Liso, V', 'Capalbo, S', 'Lapietra, A', 'Pavone, V', 'Guarini, A', 'Specchia, G']","['Liso V', 'Capalbo S', 'Lapietra A', 'Pavone V', 'Guarini A', 'Specchia G']","['Hematology, University of Bari, Policlinico, piazza Giulio Cesare 11, 70124 Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*ultrastructure', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Organ Specificity', '*Trisomy']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Mar;84(3):212-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the autocrine role played by IL-8 in the process of cell accumulation characteristic of this disease we tried to investigate clinico-biological implications of increased serum levels of this cytokine in an unselected series of B-cell CLL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum levels of IL-8 were determined at the time of diagnosis in 58 previously untreated B-CLL patients using an immunoenzyme assay. Results were correlated with main clinico-hematologic features as well as with the risk of disease progression. Finally, we looked for associations between IL-8 and molecules directly involved in apoptosis, such as intracellular bcl-2 and soluble APO-1/Fas. RESULTS: Increased serum levels of IL-8 were found in 15 out of 58 (25.8%) B-cell CLL patients. Serum levels of IL-8 did not reflect clinico-biological features representative of tumor mass such as clinical stage, histopathologic pattern of bone marrow (BM) involvement, b2-microglobulin, sCD23 and sCD27 titers. Interestingly, circulating levels of IL-8 paralleled those of intracellular bcl-2 (r = 0.522; p = 0.01), thus confirming that the antiapoptotic effect of IL-8 can be exerted through a bcl-2 dependent pathway. Levels of IL-8 did not match those of soluble Apo-1/Fas (r = -0.013; p = 0.943). Finally, stage A patients with levels of IL-8 above the median value (i.e. 4.5 pg/mL) were more likely to progress to a more advanced clinical stage than those with levels below the median value (p < 0.05). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 is an interesting marker in B-cell CLL, closely involved in the pathogenesis of disease. Furthermore, it is useful for predicting the pace of disease progression in early clinical stages.","['Molica, S', 'Vitelli, G', 'Levato, D', 'Levato, L', 'Dattilo, A', 'Gandolfo, G M']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Levato D', 'Levato L', 'Dattilo A', 'Gandolfo GM']","['Divisione Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera ""Pugliese-Ciaccio"", viale Pio X, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-8/*blood/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood/physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE/blood', 'Risk Factors', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Mar;84(3):208-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have combined our previously established quantitative assay relating the amount of release of [3H]-membrane lipid to the degree of apoptosis with electron microscopy (EM) at a series of timepoints to study apoptosis of lymphoid cells exposed to vincristine or etoposide. We find that the [3H]-membrane lipid release assay correlates well with EM studies showing the formation and release of apoptotic bodies and cell death, and both processes are regulated in parallel by inducers or inhibitors of apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or inhibition of caspases by DEVD inhibited equally well the activation of caspases as indicated by PARP cleavage. They also inhibited [3H]-membrane lipid release and release of apoptotic bodies. EM showed that cells overexpressing Bcl-2 displayed near-normal morphology and viability in response to vincristine or etoposide. In contrast, DEVD did not prevent cell death. Although DEVD inhibited the chromatin condensation, PARP cleavage, release of apoptotic bodies, and release of labeled lipid, DEVD-treated cells showed accumulation of heterogeneous vesicles trapped in the condensed cytoplasm. These results suggest that inhibition of caspases arrested the maturation and release of apoptotic bodies. Our results also imply that Bcl-2 regulates processes in addition to caspase activation.","['Zhang, J', 'Reedy, M C', 'Hannun, Y A', 'Obeid, L M']","['Zhang J', 'Reedy MC', 'Hannun YA', 'Obeid LM']","['Veterans Administration Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center and the Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM043825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM043825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG16583-01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG016583/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (tyrosyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartal)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1/physiology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Size', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1999/04/06 00:00,1999/04/06 00:01,['1999/04/06 00:00'],"['1999/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.145.1.99 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1999 Apr 5;145(1):99-108. doi: 10.1083/jcb.145.1.99.,PMC2148221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we considered the hypothesis that a panel of 22 transport-defective mutants of the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein might be defective in ER assembly. Upon cell cotransfection with wild-type envelope, however, the vast majority of these transport-defective mutants (21 of 22) exerted a specific trans-dominant negative effect. This effect was due to random dimerization of the mutated and wild-type glycoproteins that prevented the intracellular transport of the latter. This unexpected result suggests that association of glycoprotein monomers precedes the completion of folding. The only mutation that impaired this early assembly was located at the NH2 terminus of the protein. COOH-terminally truncated, soluble forms of the glycoprotein were also trans-dominant negative provided that their NH2 terminus was intact.

These AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL do not efficiently recognize tumor cells induced by Friend/Moloney/Rauscher (FMR) MuLV, which express the highly homologous peptide RSPWFTTL. In this report, we not only confirm the inefficient recognition of FMR tumors by AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL, but also demonstrate that RSPWFTTL is poorly immunogenic in C57BL/6 mice. To gain insight into the mechanism(s) contributing to the inefficient recognition of FMR MuLV-induced tumors, we examined the RSPWFTTL dissociation rate from H-2K(b) as well as the ability for RSPWFTTL to diminish CTL effector functions by T-cell antagonism. In contrast to immunogenic peptides, which form stable MHC class I-peptide complexes having slow dissociation rates, poorly immunogenic peptides characteristically have faster dissociation rates. On the basis of a cell-surface MHC class I peptide stabilization assay, the dissociation rate of RSP-WFTTL from H-2K(b) is characterized by a half-life that is nearly identical to the half-life of KSPWFTTL. In addition, we could find no evidence for antagonistic inhibition of AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL over a wide concentration range of RSPWFTTL. Analysis of the role of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), by use of recombinant vaccinia and Sindbis viruses expressing a hydrophobic amino-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting sequence coupled to RSPWFTTL, indicated that RSPWFTTL cell-surface presentation can be dramatically enhanced when directly targeted into the ER.","['Kim, V', 'Green, W R']","['Kim V', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School and The Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI-07363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tap1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', '*Genetic Variation', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1999/04/03 00:00,1999/04/03 00:01,['1999/04/03 00:00'],"['1999/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vim.1998.11.197 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 1998;11(4):197-213. doi: 10.1089/vim.1998.11.197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between 1987-1995, 774 children with ALL were treated on 2 consecutive protocols and were evaluable to assess the time required to attain CR. The authors compared presenting characteristics and outcomes of patients based on their remission status after 1 month of induction chemotherapy: CR (n = 656), protracted hypoplasia (low peripheral blood counts and/or hypocellular marrow) (n = 95), and persistent leukemia (M2 or M3 bone marrow and/or evidence of extramedullary leukemia) (n = 23). The median follow-up was 5.2 years. RESULTS: Presenting features that predicted persistent leukemia included a leukocyte count > 100,000/mm3 and T-cell phenotype. Approximately 91% of patients with persistent leukemia and 100% with protracted hypoplasia eventually achieved CR. The 5-year event free survival (EFS) (95% confidence intervals [95% CI] in parentheses) for patients with persistent leukemia after 1 month was 16% (95% CI, 0%, 31%), which was significantly worse (P < 0.001) than that for those who achieved CR within 1 month (5-year EFS, 82%; 95% CI, 79%, 86%) and that for those with protracted hypoplasia (5-year EFS, 79%; 95% CI, 70%, 87%). For patients with persistent leukemia, there was no significant difference in survival based on bone marrow status (M2 or M3) after 1 month or on the number of induction cycles received before achieving CR. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with persistent leukemia at the end of 1 month of therapy have a dismal prognosis, regardless of when they subsequently achieve CR. More intensive and/or novel therapies should be considered for this subset of patients.","['Silverman, L B', 'Gelber, R D', 'Young, M L', 'Dalton, V K', 'Barr, R D', 'Sallan, S E']","['Silverman LB', 'Gelber RD', 'Young ML', 'Dalton VK', 'Barr RD', 'Sallan SE']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure']",1999/04/03 03:16,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/03 03:16'],"['1999/04/03 03:16 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/03 03:16 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990315)85:6<1395::AID-CNCR25>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990315)85:6<1395::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Mar 15;85(6):1395-404. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990315)85:6<1395::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the largest case-control studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) conducted to date, the authors evaluated leukemia risk relative to parental self-report of cigarette smoking. METHODS: In telephone interviews in which a structured questionnaire was used, parents of 1842 ALL patients, 517 AML patients, and their matched controls were asked about their cigarette smoking habits before, during, and after the pregnancy with the index child. Risk of leukemia was examined by histologic type, age of the child at diagnosis, immunophenotype (for ALL), and French-American-British morphology group (for AML). RESULTS: The risk of ALL was not associated with the father's ever having smoked (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.20) or the mother's ever having smoked (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.91-1.19). Similarly, no significant risk of AML was observed for paternal (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.67-1.16) or maternal smoking (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.74-1.22). The relative risk of leukemia was not significantly different from the null for parental smoking in any time period during or around the index pregnancy, nor was it related to the number of cigarettes, the number of years of smoking, or the number of pack-years. A small number of sporadic, statistically significant associations were found, but overall there appeared to be no association between parental cigarette smoking and ALL or AML, or any subgroup of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Parental smoking while pregnant or exposure to cigarette smoke shortly after birth is unlikely to contribute substantially to the risk of childhood leukemia in North America.","['Brondum, J', 'Shu, X O', 'Steinbuch, M', 'Severson, R K', 'Potter, J D', 'Robison, L L']","['Brondum J', 'Shu XO', 'Steinbuch M', 'Severson RK', 'Potter JD', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Epidemiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA48051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Male', '*Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",1999/04/03 03:16,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/03 03:16'],"['1999/04/03 03:16 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/03 03:16 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990315)85:6<1380::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Mar 15;85(6):1380-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bryostatin has been demonstrated to possess both in vivo and in vitro anti-leukaemic potential. In samples derived from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients, it has been demonstrated that bryostatin-1 induces a macrophage differentiation, suppresses colony growth in vitro and promotes cytokine secretion from accessory cells. We investigated the effect of bryostatin-1 treatment on colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) capacity in the presence of accessory cells, using mononuclear cells, as well as in the absence of accessory cells using purified CD34-positive cells. Cells were obtained from 14 CML patients as well as from nine controls. Moreover, CD34-positive cells derived from CML samples and controls were analysed for stem cell frequency and ability using the long-term culture initiating cell (LTCIC) assay at limiting dilution. Individual colonies derived from both the CFU-GM and LTCIC assays were analysed for the presence of the bcr-abl gene with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to evaluate inhibition of malignant colony growth. The results show that at the CFU-GM level bryostatin-1 treatment resulted in only a 1.4-fold higher reduction of CML colony growth as compared to the control samples, both in the presence and in the absence of accessory cells. However, at the LTCIC level a sixfold higher reduction of CML growth was observed as compared to the control samples. Analysis of the LTCICs at limiting dilution indicates that this purging effect is caused by a decrease in output per malignant LTCIC combined with an increase in the normal stem cell frequency. It is concluded that bryostatin-1 selectively inhibits CML growth at the LTCIC level and should be explored as a purging modality in CML.","['Thijsen, S F', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'van Oostveen, J W', 'Theijsmeijer, A P', 'van der Hem, K G', 'Odding, J H', 'Drager, A M', 'Ossenkoppele, G J']","['Thijsen SF', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'van Oostveen JW', 'Theijsmeijer AP', 'van der Hem KG', 'Odding JH', 'Drager AM', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Haematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/04/03 00:00,1999/04/03 00:01,['1999/04/03 00:00'],"['1999/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690225 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(9-10):1406-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690225.,PMC2362710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether the modest chemical modification of bis-indol structure is responsible for the lack of anti-calmodulin potency and for the different pharmacological effects, new derivatives have been synthesized for comparative studies. The synthesis of the KAR derivatives are presented. The comparative studies showed that the spiro-oxazolidino ring and the substitution of a formyl group to a methyl one were responsible for the lack of anti-calmodulin activities. The new derivatives, similar to the mother compounds, inhibited the tubulin assembly in polymerization tests in vitro, however their inhibitory effect was highly dependent on the organization state of microtubules; bundled microtubules appeared to be resistant against the drugs. The maximal cytotoxic activities of KAR derivatives in in vivo mice hosting leukaemia P388 or Ehrlich ascites tumour cells appeared similar to that of vinblastine or vincristine, however significant prolongation of life span could be reached with KAR derivatives only after the administration of a single dose. These studies plus data obtained using a cultured human neuroblastoma cell line showed that KAR compounds displayed their cytotoxic activities at significantly higher concentrations than the mother compounds, although their antimicrotubular activities were similar in vitro. These data suggest that vinblastine/vincristine damage additional crucial cell functions, one of which could be related to calmodulin-mediated processes.","['Orosz, F', 'Comin, B', 'Rais, B', 'Puigjaner, J', 'Kovacs, J', 'Tarkanyi, G', 'Acs, T', 'Keve, T', 'Cascante, M', 'Ovadi, J']","['Orosz F', 'Comin B', 'Rais B', 'Puigjaner J', 'Kovacs J', 'Tarkanyi G', 'Acs T', 'Keve T', 'Cascante M', 'Ovadi J']","['Institute of Enzymology, Biological Research Center, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (KAR 3)', '0 (KAR 4)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PBV11IO5E (deacetoxyvinzolidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Calmodulin/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry']",1999/04/03 00:00,1999/04/03 00:01,['1999/04/03 00:00'],"['1999/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690218 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(9-10):1356-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690218.,PMC2362735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that two hammerhead ribozymes against AML1/MTG8 cleave this fusion transcript and also inhibit the proliferation of myeloid leukaemia cell line Kasumi-1 which possesses t(8;21)(q22;q22). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of inhibition of proliferation in myeloid leukaemic cells with t(8;21)(q22;q22) by ribozymes. These ribozymes specifically inhibited the growth of Kasumi-1 cells, but did not affect the leukaemic cells without t(8;21)(q22;q22). We observed the morphological changes including chromatin condensation, fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies in Kasumi-1 cells incubated with ribozymes for 7 days. In addition, DNA ladder formation was also detected after incubation with ribozymes which suggested the induction of apoptosis in Kasumi-1 cells by the AML1/MTG8 ribozymes. However, the ribozymes did not induce the expression of CD11b and CD14 antigens in Kasumi-1 cells. The above data suggest that these ribozymes therefore inhibit the growth of myeloid leukaemic cells with t(8;21)(q22;q22) by the induction of apoptosis, but not differentiation. We conclude therefore that the ribozymes targeted against AML1/MTG8 may have therapeutic potential for patients with AML carrying t(8;21)(q22;q22) while, in addition, the product of the chimeric gene is responsible for the pathogenesis of myeloid leukaemia.","['Matsushita, H', 'Kizaki, M', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Muto, A', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Matsushita H', 'Kizaki M', 'Kobayashi H', 'Muto A', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Haematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'RNA, Catalytic/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/03 00:00,1999/04/03 00:01,['1999/04/03 00:00'],"['1999/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690214 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(9-10):1325-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690214.,PMC2362727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In immunocompetent patients, the course of varicella is generally benign. For varicella zoster, post-herpetic neuralgia is the most common complication. In immunocompromised patients (particularly those with AIDS), transplant recipients and cancer patients, VZV infections can be life-threatening. For these patients and also for immunocompetent patients at risk such as pregnant women or premature infants, the current treatment of choice is based on either intravenous or oral aciclovir (acyclovir). The low oral bioavailability of aciclovir, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, have stimulated efforts towards the development of new compounds for the treatment of individuals with VZV infections. Among these new compounds, penciclovir, its oral prodrug form famciclovir and the oral pro-drug form of aciclovir (valaciclovir), rank among the most promising. As with aciclovir itself, all of these drugs are dependent on the virus-encoded thymidine kinase (TK) for their intracellular activation (phosphorylation), and, upon conversion to their triphosphate form, they act as inhibitors/alternative substrate of the viral DNA polymerase. Therefore, cross-resistance to these drugs may be expected for those virus mutants that are TK-deficient and thus resistant to aciclovir. Other classes of nucleoside analogues dependent for their phosphorylation on the viral TK that have been pursued for the treatment of VZV infections include sorivudine, brivudine, fialuridine, fiacitabine and netivudine. Among oxetanocins, which are partially dependent on viral TK, lobucavir is now under clinical evaluation. Foscarnet, which does not require any previous metabolism to interact with the viral DNA polymerase, is used in the clinic when TK-deficient VZV mutants emerge during aciclovir treatment. TK-deficient mutants are also sensitive to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i.e. [s]-1-[3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl]cytosine; HPMPC); these agents do not depend on the virus-encoded TK for their phosphorylation but depend on cellular enzymes for conversion to their diphosphoryl derivatives which then inhibit viral DNA synthesis. Vaccination for VZV has now come of age. It is recommended for healthy children, patients with leukaemia, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or those with chronic diseases. The protection induced by the vaccine seems, to some extent, to include zoster and associated neuralgia. Passive immuniatin based on specific immunoglobulins does not effectively prevent VZV infection and is therefore restricted to high risk individuals (i.e. immunocompromised children and pregnant women).","['Snoeck, R', 'Andrei, G', 'De Clercq, E']","['Snoeck R', 'Andrei G', 'De Clercq E']","['Rega Institute for Medical Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. robert.snoeck@rega.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chickenpox/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Herpes Zoster/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence/drug effects', 'Immunocompromised Host/drug effects', '*Viral Vaccines/therapeutic use']",1999/04/03 00:00,1999/04/03 00:01,['1999/04/03 00:00'],"['1999/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199957020-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1999 Feb;57(2):187-206. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199957020-00005.,,230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase via caspase-3.,10654-60,"Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, has been recognized as an inducer of apoptosis in various cell lines. Here, we demonstrated the intracellular formation of ceramide, a lipid signal mediator, in SNP-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells and investigated the mechanisms of ceramide generation. The levels of intracellular ceramide increased to, at most, 160% of the control level in a time- and dose-dependent manner when the cells were treated with 1 mM SNP. SNP also decreased the sphingomyelin level to approximately 70% of the control level and increased magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity to 160% of the control activity 2 h after treatment. Neither acid SMase nor magnesium-independent N-SMase was affected by SNP. Caspases are thought to be key enzymes in apoptotic cell death. Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde, a synthetic tetrapeptide inhibitor of caspases, inhibited magnesiumdependent N-SMase, ceramide generation, and apoptosis. Moreover, recombinant purified caspase-3 increased magnesium-dependent N-SMase in a cell-free system. These results suggest that the findings that SNP increased ceramide generation and magnesium-dependent N-SMase activity via caspase-3 are interesting to future study to determine the relation between caspases and sphingolipid metabolites in NO-mediated signaling.","['Takeda, Y', 'Tashima, M', 'Takahashi, A', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Okazaki, T']","['Takeda Y', 'Tashima M', 'Takahashi A', 'Uchiyama T', 'Okazaki T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Clinical Sciences for Pathological Organs, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-Kawaharamachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8397, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Magnesium/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitroprusside/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism']",1999/04/03 00:00,1999/04/03 00:01,['1999/04/03 00:00'],"['1999/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.15.10654 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73761-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 9;274(15):10654-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.15.10654.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant wild-type or mutant gp91(phox) was expressed in a human myeloid leukemia cell line in which the endogenous gp91(phox) gene was disrupted by gene targeting. NADPH oxidase activity was measured in a cytochrome c reduction assay following granulocytic differentiation of cells that expressed recombinant gp91(phox). Expression of a gp91(phox) mutant in which amino acids 89-97 were replaced with nine alternate amino acids abolished NADPH oxidase activity. Expression of gp91(phox) mutants R89T, D95A, D95R, R96A, R96E, or K102T did not significantly affect NADPH oxidase activity. However, mutations of individual or paired arginine residues at positions 91 and 92 had substantial effects on superoxide generation. The R91E/R92E mutation completely abolished both NADPH oxidase activity and membrane-translocation of the cytosolic oxidase proteins p47(phox), p67(phox), Rac1, and Rac2. The phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced rate of superoxide production was reduced by approximately 75% in cells expressing R91T/R92A, R91E, or R92E gp91(phox) along with an increased lag time to the maximal rates of superoxide production relative to cells expressing wild-type gp91(phox). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Arg91 and Arg92 of gp91(phox) are essential for flavocytochrome b558 function in granulocytes and suggest that these residues participate in the interaction of gp91(phox) with the cytosolic oxidase proteins.","['Biberstine-Kinkade, K J', 'Yu, L', 'Dinauer, M C']","['Biberstine-Kinkade KJ', 'Yu L', 'Dinauer MC']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Departments of Pediatrics (Hematology/Oncology), James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '9064-78-2 (cytochrome b558)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome b Group/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/*enzymology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/03 00:00,1999/04/03 00:01,['1999/04/03 00:00'],"['1999/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.15.10451 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73733-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Apr 9;274(15):10451-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.15.10451.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By screening a mammalian cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid cloning technique, we isolated a ubiquitin-homology protein, DAP-1, which specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic death domain of TNF-R1. Sequence analysis reveals that DAP-1 shares striking sequence homology with the yeast SMT3 protein that is essential for the maintenance of chromosome integrity during mitosis (Meluh, P. B., and Koshland, D. (1995) Mol. Biol. Cell 6, 793-807). DAP-1 is nearly identical to PIC1, a protein that interacts with the PML tumor suppressor implicated in acute promyelocytic leukemia (Boddy, M. N., Howe, K., Etkin, L. D., Solomon, E., and Freemont, P. S. (1996) Oncogene 13, 971-982), and the sentrin protein, which associates with the Fas death receptor (Okura, T., Gong, L., Kamitani, T., Wada, T., Okura, I., Wei, C. F., Chang, H. M., and Yeh, E. T. (1996) J. Immunol. 157, 4277-4281). The in vivo interaction between DAP-1 and TNF-R1 was further confirmed in mammalian cells. In transient transfection assays, overexpression of DAP-1 suppresses NF-kappaB/Rel activity in 293T cells, a human kidney embryonic carcinoma cell line. Overexpression of either DAP-1 or sentrin causes apoptosis of TNF-sensitive L929 fibroblast cell line, as well as TNF-resistant osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS. Furthermore, the dominant negative Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) protein blocks the cell death induced by either DAP-1 or FADD.

The 40 patients enrolled (22 rhGM-CSF, 18 placebo) could have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease, be of any age, and were undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation in a metropolitan cancer research centre. Main outcome measures consisted of initial hospital lengths of stay (LOS), total and department charges, rehospitalisation rates and charges, and outpatient charges, all inclusive of the first 100 days following bone marrow infusion. The perspective of the study is that of the third party payer. Initial hospitalisation charges were $US54 100 for patients who received rhGM-CSF and $US68 600 for patients who received placebo (p = 0.05). The difference of $US14 500 was 21% less in patients who received rhGM-CSF, mainly due to lower average LOS with rhGM-CSF (24.2 days) compared with placebo (30.8 days). Outpatient charges were $US9500 (rhGM-CSF) and $US6800 (placebo) {p = 0.18}. Total charges, including readmission (10 per group) were $US12 200 lower in the rhGM-CSF group ($US70 300 vs $US82 500, p = 0.19).

Development of genetically engineered drugs is very expensive and as these products become available the impact on healthcare costs could be vast. The cost-benefit ratio of biotechnology products needs to be established, but few relevant pharmacoeconomic studies are available. Issues in pharmacoeconomic analysis of genetically engineered drugs can be exemplified by the data available for alteplase, epoetin and interferon alpha-2b. One study concluded that thrombolysis with streptokinase rather than alteplase would substantially reduce the percentage of total hospital costs that were not reimbursed. However, differences in efficacy were not accounted for. Based on the superior efficacy of alteplase, a more extensive pharmacoeconomic analysis found that alteplase was more cost-effective than streptokinase when the agents were combined with aggressive reocclusion management. However, this conclusion may be altered by the finding of a more recent study that streptokinase may be at least as effective as alteplase. Economic factors involved in epoetin treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal disease have been studied thoroughly. However, cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis was not attempted, and improvement in quality of life with epoetin therapy also needs to be considered, to facilitate cost-utility analysis. Compared with chlorambucil, the use of interferon alpha-2b for hairy cell leukaemia resulted in significant direct and indirect cost savings, in a retrospective cost-benefit analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jones-Grizzle, A J', 'Bootman, J L']","['Jones-Grizzle AJ', 'Bootman JL']","['College of Pharmacy, Center for Pharmaceutical Economics, University of Arizona, Tucson.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)']",,"['Anemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Biotechnology/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Therapy/economics', '*Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/economics', 'Genetic Engineering/*economics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*economics', 'Research']",1991/12/10 00:00,1991/12/10 00:01,['1991/12/10 00:00'],"['1991/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00019053-199201010-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1992 Jan;1(1):45-53. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199201010-00009.,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: Professional literature and authors' experience. DATA SYNTHESIS: Novel technologies for evaluating bone marrow specimens that have prognostic and therapeutic value in chronic and acute leukemia have been recently developed. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays that are useful in detecting chromosomal translocations in CML and AML are relevant to diagnosis and initial therapy. These assays can also be used to detect minimal residual disease after therapy and thus have prognostic value. In addition, a novel and elegant technique for determining leukemic cell resistance to chemotherapy agents (in vitro drug sensitivity) has prognostic and therapeutic value in AML. Use of these assays may lead to greater diagnostic precision, improved prognostication and more effective therapy. CONCLUSION: Cutting edge technologies that have utility in the evaluation of bone marrow specimens include polymerase chain reaction based assays for detecting specific chromosomal translocations, particularly useful in CML and AML, as well as in vitro drug sensitivity testing in AML.","['Larson, R S', 'McCurley, T L']","['Larson RS', 'McCurley TL']","['Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lab Sci,Clinical laboratory science : journal of the American Society for Medical Technology,8806547,,,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods/*standards', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis']",1996/10/04 00:00,1996/10/04 00:01,['1996/10/04 00:00'],"['1996/10/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Lab Sci. 1996 Nov-Dec;9(6):354-7.,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reasonable caution exists regarding the use of allogeneic PBSC for transplantation because of donor toxicities due to rhG-CSF administration and the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in the recipient because of the large number of T-cell infused. We present preliminary data on allogeneic PBSC collections and transplantation in ten patients affected by advanced leukemia (eight patients), severe aplastic anemia (one patient) and sickle cell anemia (one patient). Seven donors were HLA-identical siblings, while the other three were mismatched for three, two and one locus, respectively. All donors received rhG-CSF at a dose of 12 micrograms/kg for a mean of 5 days. Leukaphereses were performed with the aim of collecting a minimum of 5 x 10(6)/kg (recipient's weight) CD 34+ cells. Collection timing was determined by monitoring CD 34+ cells in the donor's peripheral blood from the second day of rhG-CSF therapy. The PBSC collections yielded a mean of 10.05 x 10(8) MNCs/kg and of 10.48 x 10(6) CD 34+ cells/kg (recipient's weight). PBSC were immediately infused after collection in patients given myeloablative therapy. Engraftment was observed in each patient at a mean of 13.2 days for an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) more than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and of 26.5 days for a platelet count of more than 20 x 10(9)/L. Eight patients experienced no or moderate acute GVHD, whereas two patients died of grade 4 GVHD, notwithstanding GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine and prednisone. Two other patients died of viral and fungal infections, respectively, despite prophylaxis. The remaining six patients are alive between 58 and 430 days after transplant. Our results document that allogeneic PBSC are capable of engraftment after a myeloablative regimen. Controlled trials are necessary to compare the potential benefits of this approach with the results obtained in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Perotti, C', 'Torretta, L', 'Locatelli, F', 'Salvaneschi, L']","['Perotti C', 'Torretta L', 'Locatelli F', 'Salvaneschi L']","['Servizio di Immunoematologia e Trasfusione, I.R.C.C.S.

Five patients had monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance, two had lung cancer, one breast cancer, one hairy cell leukemia and later carcinoma of the pancreas; two had hepato-splenomegaly and hemolytic anemia; nine were idiopathic (two with autoimmune markers). Plasmapheresis varied from 4 to 31 plasma volumes and procedures with a median of 12, always with 5% albumin. Two excellent responses, one very good, two moderate transient and 12 had no change in clinical or conduction status. Best response occurred in paraproteinemias.

In all of these diseases, the optimisation of indications, conditioning schemes, stem cell harvest techniques and supportive care with growth factors is subject to continuous preclinical research and clinical phase II and III studies. Recently, the administration of peripheral blood stem cell preparations to cancer patients as rescue therapy after high dosage antitumour therapy has been received with much enthusiasm. At first glance, the technique looks rather easy to perform. The faster recovery of haemopoiesis, compared with ABMT, leads to shorter durations of hospitalisation. Moreover, in most studies, peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT) resulted in fewer septic episodes, fewer intensive care admissions, fewer red blood cell and platelet transfusions, reduced use of anti-infectives and parenteral nutrition, and reduced hospital costs compared with ABMT. The overall conclusion is that the treatment costs of PBPCT are 15 to 30% lower than the treatment costs of ABMT. However, a formal comparison between PBPCT and ABMT, assessing the differences in toxicity, costs and quality of life, is still awaited.","['Uyl-de Groot, C A', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Rutten, F F']","['Uyl-de Groot CA', 'Huijgens PC', 'Rutten FF']","['Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/economics', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics/methods', 'Humans', 'Quality of Life']",1996/06/06 00:00,1996/06/06 00:01,['1996/06/06 00:00'],"['1996/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00019053-199610010-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1996 Jul;10(1):23-35. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199610010-00004.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared 2 innovative pharmaceutical options (oral fluconazole and intravenous liposomal amphotericin) with existing standard practice (oral polyenes). Costs were measured over a 12-week treatment period, and were compared with the 2 effectiveness measures: (i) the avoidance of colonisation or infection; and (ii) the patients' ability to continue with prophylaxis in an uninfected state. The costs and effectiveness of BMT itself were not considered in this evaluation. The costs per successfully treated patient over a 12-week period were 28,956 pounds (1 pound = $US1.60, June 1995) for oral fluconazole, 53,225 pounds for liposomal amphotericin and 32,768 pounds for oral polyenes. Sensitivity analysis showed that the costs of liposomal amphotericin always exceeded those of the oral comparators, reflecting its high acquisition, preparation and administration costs.","['Stewart, A', 'Powles, R', 'Hewetson, M', 'Antrum, J', 'Richardson, C', 'Mehta, J']","['Stewart A', 'Powles R', 'Hewetson M', 'Antrum J', 'Richardson C', 'Mehta J']","['Personal Social Services Research Unit/Canterbury Business School, University of Kent at Canterbury, England.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Polyenes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/economics/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Carriers', 'Fluconazole/economics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Models, Economic', 'Mycoses/*economics/*prevention & control', 'Oropharynx/microbiology', 'Polyenes/economics/therapeutic use', 'Probability', 'United Kingdom']",1995/09/05 00:00,1995/09/05 00:01,['1995/09/05 00:00'],"['1995/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00019053-199508040-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1995 Oct;8(4):350-61. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199508040-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival, however, is not necessarily inferior if recipient incompatibility is limited to one HLA locus. Available methods for post-transplant immunosuppression have not allowed similar success with transplants incompatible for two or three HLA loci. GVHD incidence and severity can be decreased by depletion of donor T cells from the marrow inoculum. However, the potential benefit is offset by increased graft failure and leukemia relapse with no improvement in survival. Since fewer than 30% of the patients in North America or Europe have an HLA-matched sibling and less than 5% have a one HLA-locus mismatched relative, most candidates for an allogeneic marrow transplant are in need of an unrelated donor. As of October 1993, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has accrued more than 1 million volunteers typed for HLA-A and B, including 200,000 typed for HLA-DR, and has provided donors for more than 2000 transplants. The probability of finding an HLA-A, B, DR match at the initial search has increased from 10-15% in 1987, to 50-55% in 1992. An additional 12% of patients will find a match when available HLA-A and B matched donors are typed for DR, and 20% of patients have a one HLA-locus incompatible unrelated donor. Through an international network of regional registries a search for an unrelated donor can now be conducted among 1.7 million volunteers worldwide. Unrelated donor transplants have allowed long-term disease-free survival of patients with a variety of hematological disorders. When compared to HLA-matched sibling transplants, unrelated donor transplants are associated with an increase in the incidence of graft failure and GVHD. Such an increase may be due to undetected HLA disparities or to non-HLA-linked histocompatibility genes. At our center patients with CML in chronic phase, the most common indication for unrelated donor transplantation, have a 50-55% probability of survival 2-6 years after an unrelated donor transplant, whereas patients with aplastic or refractory anemia have a 25-35% probability of survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Anasetti, C', 'Hansen, J A']","['Anasetti C', 'Hansen JA']","['Immunogenetics Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Transfus Sci,Transfusion science,9001514,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Tissue Donors']",1994/08/06 00:00,1994/08/06 00:01,['1994/08/06 00:00'],"['1994/08/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/06 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0955-3886(94)90134-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0955-3886(94)90134-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Sci. 1994 Sep;15(3):221-30. doi: 10.1016/0955-3886(94)90134-1.,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, asparaginase therapy is associated with a high incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (up to 73%), including life-threatening anaphylaxis, and its half-life of approximately 20 hours necessitates daily administration. Pegaspargase, a modification of L-asparaginase, has a longer half-life (357 hours), a decreased incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, and when doses every 14 days, provides comparable efficacy to asparaginase; however, it is much more expensive per single-dose vial ($980.00 vs $52.38). To determine the pharmacoeconomic impact of the two agents, we conducted a cost-minimization analysis for three common adult ALL protocols.

CONCLUSION: Flow cytometry is especially useful in monitoring immunodeficiencies, leukemias, and other malignancies, but it has other uses, as well. Improvements in instruments, reagents, and methods will cause an increase in the number of applications for flow cytometry.

DESIGN: Prospective, open, non-randomised study. SETTING: University Hospital, medical intensive care unit. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Eighteen haematological patients with acute respiratory failure which occurred before, during or just after therapeutic aplasia were ventilated with Ni-IPPV delivered via an individual nasal mask or a standard facial mask. Non-invasive ventilation was achieved until weaning (success (S)) or intubation (failure (F)). RESULTS: Twelve patients were ultimately intubated and died (F group). Seven needed intubation within 3 hours following admission because of the inability of Ni-IPPV to provide adequate ventilation in six patients and after cardiac arrest, probably related to cardiac aspergillosis in one patient. Six patients were not intubated and were discharged alive (S group). Of 11 patients who received Ni-IPPV for more than 3 hours, the respiratory rate decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from 33 +/- 7 breaths/min to 24 +/- 5 breaths/min with Ni-IPPV and the PaO2 increased significantly from 6.6 +/- 1.7 kPa upon admission to 17.7 +/- 5.5 kPa during Ni-IPPV. Mean daily ventilation was 12 +/- 7 hours for a mean duration of 5.5 +/- 4.4 days. Pressure support was used in nine patients and appeared the most efficient ventilation mode of non-invasive ventilation. The duration per day of Ni-IPPV was shorter and PaCO2 values during Ni-IPPV were lower in the S group than in the F group. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is able to provide adequate ventilatory support for many haematological patients and allows avoidance of ventilation in some.","['Tognet, E', 'Mercatello, A', 'Polo, P', 'Coronel, B', 'Bret, M', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Moskovtchenko, J F']","['Tognet E', 'Mercatello A', 'Polo P', 'Coronel B', 'Bret M', 'Archimbaud E', 'Moskovtchenko JF']","['Service de reanimation, Hopital E Herriot, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Intensive Care,Clinical intensive care : international journal of critical & coronary care medicine,9101410,['142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)'],,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carbon Dioxide/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intermittent Positive-Pressure Ventilation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Partial Pressure', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology/*therapy', 'Time Factors']",1993/12/09 00:00,1993/12/09 00:01,['1993/12/09 00:00'],"['1993/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Intensive Care. 1994;5(6):282-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale of this approach is to overcome the chemotherapy resistance of tumour cells by increasing the dose of cytotoxic drugs. However, the clinical benefit of dose-intensification has been difficult to prove. Almost all studies of ABMT have been done without randomised comparisons with the standard form of therapy for a specific condition. From an economic perspective, the cost of ABMT has been steadily decreasing with improvements in supportive care primarily. Still, current ABMT cost estimates range from $US70 000 to $US150 000 for each uncomplicated procedure. Despite the lack of compelling evidence in support of dose-intensification, ABMT has become a default standard of care after relapse for many patients with lymphoma or leukaemia. We used a decision analysis model to estimate the cost effectiveness of the timing of ABMT in relapsed Hodgkin's disease. The model illustrates the difficulty of using available clinical trial data when follow-up of promising early reports is not available. The model showed that in most situations the optimal strategy is ABMT in second relapse despite growing consensus that immediate ABMT is the treatment of choice. ABMT for women with high-risk or early metastatic breast cancer is one of the most controversial areas in clinical oncology. In the US, several ongoing major randomised trials are addressing the role of ABMT in breast cancer. Using a Markov process we found that ABMT is the preferred strategy under almost all assumptions. The size of the benefit and cost effectiveness of ABMT varied markedly depending on the assumptions made. The model does not supplant the need for randomised trials that concurrently measure efficacy, quality of life, and resource utilisation. However, such analyses point out the critical areas where costs could be cut substantially without effecting efficacy. Drawing conclusions about the cost effectiveness of ABMT for all conditions is hampered by the lack of randomised comparisons of efficacy. Concurrent economic appraisals of selected phase III comparative trials should be considered since the supportive care costs associated with ABMT appear to be stabilising. However, the most important point is that randomised trials are the only mechanism for estimating the therapeutic effect of high dose chemotherapy.","['Hillner, B E', 'Smith, T J', 'Desch, C E']","['Hillner BE', 'Smith TJ', 'Desch CE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*economics/trends', 'Breast Neoplasms/economics/*therapy', 'Cost Savings', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Therapy/economics', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/economics/*therapy', 'Models, Econometric', 'Technology Assessment, Biomedical', 'Transplantation, Autologous/economics/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/07/07 00:00,1994/07/07 00:01,['1994/07/07 00:00'],"['1994/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00019053-199406020-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1994 Aug;6(2):114-26. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199406020-00004.,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it also demonstrates efficacy as monotherapy, and is of use in relapsed or refractory disease, most comparative clinical trials have administered idarubicin intravenously in combination with cytarabine in newly diagnosed patients. These trials indicate that improved survival and response rates, and rapid achievement of remission, are more likely with idarubicin than with daunorubicin, when both agents are given in combination with cytarabine. In elderly patients, however, response rates are lower than in younger patients, and there is less disparity in efficacy between idarubicin and daunorubicin induction therapy. Although AML is an expensive disease to treat, the majority of costs are associated with the length of hospitalisation, with the acquisition cost of the chemotherapy agents contributing less than 10% to overall expenditure. Idarubicin combined with cytarabine therapy achieved higher response rates with the first cycle of therapy than daunorubicin, thereby reducing the requirements for a second cycle of therapy and further hospitalisation. Compared with daunorubicin plus cytarabine induction treatment, idarubicin plus cytarabine reduced the costs of achieving a complete response by between 22 and 39% in patients with a median age less than 60 years. In patients with a median age of 62 years, who are more representative of the AML population, costs of achieving a complete response were reduced by 3 to 6%. Thus, idarubicin is more cost effective than daunorubicin as induction therapy in combination with cytarabine, in adult patients with AML.

DATA SOURCES: Recent texts, professional journals, and authors' experiences. STUDY SELECTION: Not specified. DATA EXTRACTION: Not specified. DATA SYNTHESIS: The B- and T-cell rearrangement test can detect a monoclonal population of B- and T-cells, strongly indicative of neoplasia. This is accomplished through the use of DNA probes. The presence of a unique band on the Southern blot signifies a monoclonal gene rearrangement, which can make or confirm a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder and classify the lineage as B- or T-cell. T-cell neoplasms generally behave more aggressively than B-cell neoplasms, which can have important implications for prognosis and therapy. The unique gene rearrangement ""signature"" can be followed during and after therapy to document remission or recurrence. The most commonly examined samples are from the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, but any tissue or fluid suspected of harboring a lymphoid neoplasm can be examined.

These patients are usually initially treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy that provides broad spectrum coverage. In a study evaluating a conventional regimen of vancomycin 40 mg/kg/d plus ceftazidime 100 mg/kg/d given in three divided doses to 41 febrile children with leukemia or lymphoma, the response rate was 87% after a mean treatment duration of 16 days. A once-daily regimen of an investigational antibiotic, teicoplanin, 10 mg/kg/d and ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/d evaluated in 47 febrile children with leukemia was found to produce an equivalent rate of success and require the same mean duration of therapy. A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the economic impact of replacing the conventional regimen with once-daily teicoplanin-ceftriaxone revealed that a 16-day course of the latter treatment would produce cost savings in terms of the cost of the antibiotics and other nonreusable materials, as well as in nursing time. Using French drug pricing data, the savings calculated for drugs and materials were 478 FF ($80 US). The teicoplanin-ceftriaxone regimen saved approximately 14 hours in nursing time per patient. Extrapolations based on estimates of hospital occupancy and the ratio of days a patient receives antibiotic therapy to the total duration of hospital stay suggest that an average hospital ward could achieve monthly costsavings of 7,641 FF ($1,273 US) for antibiotics and materials.","['Schaison, G S']",['Schaison GS'],"['Hospital St. Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hosp Formul,Hospital formulary,7508609,"['61036-62-2 (Teicoplanin)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)']",,"['Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', 'Ceftriaxone/economics', 'Child', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/*economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/nursing', 'Paris', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/economics/*prevention & control', 'Teicoplanin/economics']",1993/01/01 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hosp Formul. 1993 Jan;28 Suppl 1:20-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The case chosen for this attempt is pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The basis for setting the price of treatment is the division of the illness into episodes of care that correspond to medical events. There is a fixed fee schedule for each episode, and this fee schedule covers all the expenditures incurred during the episode. The fee schedule is fixed at the onset of the disease and depends solely on medical risk factors. Physicians can use the combination of resources they consider best for their patients and hospital management must find a cost-effective way to provide the required care. The advantage to patients is that they no longer have to obtain payers' agreement but receive state-of-the-art treatment in a teaching hospital.","['Durand-Zaleski, I']",['Durand-Zaleski I'],"['Hopitaux de Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Health Policy,"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8409431,,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contract Services/economics', 'Cost Control/methods', '*Episode of Care', 'Fee Schedules/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Teaching/*economics/organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Managed Care Programs/*economics', 'Models, Econometric', 'New England', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*economics/therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index']",1992/04/08 00:00,1992/04/08 00:01,['1992/04/08 00:00'],"['1992/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-8510(92)90129-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0168-8510(92)90129-y [doi]']",ppublish,Health Policy. 1992 May;21(1):65-76. doi: 10.1016/0168-8510(92)90129-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their biophysical properties include the relatively fast kinetics of the inactivation gate and much slower kinetics of the activation gate. In order to elucidate how the complex time- and voltage-dependent activation properties of ERG channels underlies distinct roles in excitability, we investigated different types of ERG channels intrinsically present in cells or heterologously expressed in mammalian cells or Xenopus oocytes. Voltage-dependent activation curves were highly dependent on the features of the eliciting protocols. Only very long preconditioning times produced true steady-state relationships, a fact that has been largely neglected in the past, hampering the comparison of published data on ERG channels. Beyond this technical aspect, the slow activation property of ERG can be responsible for unsuspected physiological roles. We found that around the midpoint of the activation curve, the time constant of ERG open-close kinetics is of the order of 10-15 s. During sustained trains of depolarizations, e.g. those produced in neuronal firing, this leads to the use-dependent accumulation of open-state ERG channels. Accumulation is not observed in a mutant with a fast activation gate. In conclusion, it is well established that other K+ channels (i.e. Ca2+-activated and M) control the spike-frequency adaptation, but our results support the notion that the purely voltage-dependent activation property of ERG channels would allow a slow inhibitory physiological role in rapid neuronal signalling.","['Schonherr, R', 'Rosati, B', 'Hehl, S', 'Rao, V G', 'Arcangeli, A', 'Olivotto, M', 'Heinemann, S H', 'Wanke, E']","['Schonherr R', 'Rosati B', 'Hehl S', 'Rao VG', 'Arcangeli A', 'Olivotto M', 'Heinemann SH', 'Wanke E']","['Department of General Physiology and Biochemistry, Laboratory of Electrophysiology, University of Milan, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (KCNH6 protein, human)', '0 (Kcnh2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cation Transport Proteins', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating/*physiology', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Oocytes/physiology', 'Potassium Channels/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated', 'Rats', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/physiology', 'Xenopus']",1999/04/02 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1999/04/02 00:00'],"['1999/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00493.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1999 Mar;11(3):753-60. doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00493.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To detect residual CML after bone marrow transplantation, mRNA from at least 10(5) leukocytes should be analyzed, but the RNase activity of the cells precludes simple leukocytes lysis as an alternative to RNA extraction. We sought to identify the main source of RNase activity of leukocytes. METHODS: We used a three-step chromatographic process and amino acid sequence analysis. We selected eosinophil-free granulocytes by using a biotinylated CD16 antibody and selected mononuclear cells by fractionating the leukocytes with a Ficoll-Paque(R) density gradient. RESULTS: Chromatography and amino acid sequencing identified eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) as the main source of leukocyte RNase. Depletion of eosinophils reduced the EDN content of cell lysates by approximately 90%, allowing a signal from a lysate of 50 K562 Ph1-positive cells mixed with 10(5) CD16(+) granulocytes that was equivalent to 77% of the signal in the absence of leukocytes. A similar lysate with mononuclear cells gave a signal equivalent to 53% of that without mononuclear cells. RNA extraction gave a signal equivalent to only 24% of the leukocyte-free control. CONCLUSION: The depletion of eosinophils during the preparation of leukocyte samples for RT-PCR efficiently reduces the risk of mRNA degradation by ribonucleases, enabling RT-PCR analysis directly from cell lysates with a better signal than can be obtained by RNA extraction.","['Hamalainen, M M', 'Eskola, J U', 'Hellman, J', 'Pulkki, K']","['Hamalainen MM', 'Eskola JU', 'Hellman J', 'Pulkki K']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Turku, Finland. mauham@utu.fi']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.- (Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin', 'Eosinophils/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Leukocytes/*chemistry/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Ribonucleases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1999/04/02 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1999/04/02 00:00'],"['1999/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Chem. 1999 Apr;45(4):465-71.,,,['Clin Chem. 1999 Apr;45(4):449-50.

Adenoviral but not retroviral vectors efficiently infected intact pancreatic islets and fetal islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) in suspension. When islets and ICCs were plated in monolayer culture, infection efficiency with all three viral vectors increased. Ad-GFP infected 90-95% of the cells, whereas infection with MLV-GFP and Lenti-GFP increased only slightly. Both exposure to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and dispersion of the cells by removal from the culture dish and replating had substantial positive effects on the efficiency of infection with retroviral vectors. Studies of virus entry and cell replication revealed that cell dispersion and stimulation by HGF/SF may be acting through both mechanisms to increase the efficiency of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Although HGF/SF and cell dispersion increased the efficiency of infection with MLV-GFP, only rare cells with weak staining for insulin were infected, whereas approximately 25% of beta-cells were infected with Lenti-GFP. We conclude that adenovirus is the most potent vector for ex vivo overexpression of foreign genes in adult endocrine pancreatic cells and is the best vector for applications where high-level but transient expression is desired. Under the optimal conditions of cell dispersion plus HGF/SF, infection with MLV and lentiviral vectors is reasonably efficient and stable, but only lentiviral vectors efficiently infect pancreatic beta-cells.","['Leibowitz, G', 'Beattie, G M', 'Kafri, T', 'Cirulli, V', 'Lopez, A D', 'Hayek, A', 'Levine, F']","['Leibowitz G', 'Beattie GM', 'Kafri T', 'Cirulli V', 'Lopez AD', 'Hayek A', 'Levine F']","['Center for Molecular Genetics, Whittier Institute, UCSD School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,,IM,"['Adenoviridae Infections/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytological Techniques', 'Fetus/physiology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans/embryology/*physiology/virology', 'Lentivirus/physiology', 'Lentivirus Infections/virology', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/virology', 'Rhabdoviridae Infections/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/classification/physiology', 'Viruses/*genetics']",1999/04/02 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1999/04/02 00:00'],"['1999/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2337/diabetes.48.4.745 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetes. 1999 Apr;48(4):745-53. doi: 10.2337/diabetes.48.4.745.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spi-1/PU.1 is expressed in the disease induced by the original Friend virus SFFV(F-MuLV) complex in adult mice. In contrast, FLI-1 is overexpressed in about 75% of the erythroleukemias induced by the F-MuLV helper virus in newborn mice. To analyse the consequences of the enforced expression of FLI-1 on erythroblast differentiation and proliferation and to compare its activity to that of PU.1/Spi-1, we used a heterologous system of avian primary erythroblasts previously described to study the cooperation between Spi-1/PU.1 and the other molecular alterations observed in SFFV-induced disease. FLI-1 was found: (i) to inhibit the apoptotic cell death program normally activated in erythroblasts following Epo deprivation; (ii) to inhibit the terminal differentiation program induced in these cells in response to Epo and; (iii) to induce their proliferation. However, in contrast to Spi-1/PU.1, the effects of FLI-1 on erythroblast, differentiation and proliferation did not require its cooperation with an abnormally activated form of the EpoR. Enhanced survival of FLI-1 expressing erythroblasts correlated with the upregulation of bcl2 expression. FLI-1 also prevented the rapid downregulation of cyclin D2 and D3 expression normally observed during Epo-induced differentiation and delayed the downregulation of several other genes involved in cell cycle or cell proliferation control. Our results show that overexpression of FLI-1 profoundly deregulates the normal balance between differentiation and proliferation in primary erythroblasts. Thus, the activation of FLI-1 expression observed at the onset of F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia may provide a proliferative advantage to virus infected cells that would otherwise undergo terminal differentiation or cell death.","['Pereira, R', 'Quang, C T', 'Lesault, I', 'Dolznig, H', 'Beug, H', 'Ghysdael, J']","['Pereira R', 'Quang CT', 'Lesault I', 'Dolznig H', 'Beug H', 'Ghysdael J']","['CNRS UMR146, Institut Curie-Section de Recherche, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Ccnd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transfection']",1999/04/02 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1999/04/02 00:00'],"['1999/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202534 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Feb 25;18(8):1597-608. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202534.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the 6th day of chemotherapy, she was in a drowsy state following generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting 20 minutes. MR images revealed extensive cortical and subcortical white matter brain edema. Alertness returned over the 24 hr following by the discontinuation of BH-AC and intravenous administration of diphenylhydantoin, although she complained of intermittent headaches and visual disturbance. She gradually recovered from these symptoms during subsequent 7 days. Previously noted abnormal signal intensities have nearly disappreared on follow-up MRI obtained on the 22nd day after the first seizure. She was discharged without any neurologic sequela.

Four synthesizing enzymes, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), LTA4 hydrolase and LTC4 synthase, and an enzyme associated protein, 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) are involved in the generation of LTC4 and LTB4. We examined the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for these LT synthesizing enzymes and an associated protein in DMSO differentiated HL-60 cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The production of LTC4 and LTB4, measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), was increased after the incubation with DMSO for more than 3 days. Messenger RNA abundance for 5-LO, LTC4 synthase and LTA4 hydrolase was increased, that for FLAP was stable, but that for cPLA2 was decreased. These results indicate that DMSO induced increase of LT synthesis is associated with the increase of mRNA expression of 5-LO, LTC4 synthase and LTA4 hydrolase, although the precise regulatory mechanisms of the increased mRNA expression are not determined. We also investigated an action of dexamethasone (DEX) on DMSO-induced enhancement of LT synthesis. DEX suppressed DMSO induced increase of LTC4 synthesis, but rather enhanced DMSO induced LTB4 production. The DEX attenuated the DMSO-induced increase of mRNA expression for LTC4 synthase, but showed no effect on that for LTA4 hydrolase. The inhibition of LTC4 synthesis is associated with the suppression of mRNA expression for LTC4 synthase. However, increased LTB4 synthesis by DEX is regulated by the mechanisms which are independent from mRNA level of LTA4 hydrolase.","['Zaitsu, M', 'Hamasaki, Y', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Kita, M', 'Hayasaki, R', 'Muro, E', 'Kobayashi, I', 'Matsuo, M', 'Ichimaru, T', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Zaitsu M', 'Hamasaki Y', 'Yamamoto S', 'Kita M', 'Hayasaki R', 'Muro E', 'Kobayashi I', 'Matsuo M', 'Ichimaru T', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",8802730,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Leukotriene A4)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukotriene A4/metabolism', 'Leukotriene C4/metabolism', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1999/04/02 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1999/04/02 00:00'],"['1999/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0952-3278(98)90100-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 1998 Dec;59(6):385-93. doi: 10.1016/s0952-3278(98)90100-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For 35 long-time survivors (median follow-up 7 y) serial evaluations before and after ABMT included ECG, chest radiography, echocardiography and equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography (RVG). One patient had frequent supraventricular ectopic beats after ABMT, a finding not previously noted. The mean left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDD) was 104% of expected before ABMT (95% confidence interval 99-110). During the first year post-transplant LVDD was about 110% of expected, but thereafter normalization occurred. The mean shortening fraction before ABMT was 31% (CI 29-34), compared with the mean value of 34% for healthy children in our laboratory, and it ranged between 29% and 33% during the follow-up period. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction determined by RVG was 65% (CI 61-69) and mean right ventricular ejection fraction was 46% (CI 43-49) before ABMT, and they did not change during follow-up.

However, the optimal form of preventive CNS therapy remains debatable. PROCEDURE: To address this issue, we evaluated the efficacy of CNS preventive therapy for 572 children with ALL who achieved complete remission in the Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group (CCLSG) ALL874 (1987-1990) and ALL911 (1991-1993) studies. They received risk-directed therapy based on age and leukocyte count. In the ALL 874 study, the non-high-risk (low-risk [LR] + intermediate risk [IR]) patients were randomly assigned to the conventional cranial irradiation (CRT) regimen (L874A and I874A) and the high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) regimen without CRT (L874B and I874B). The former patients received 18-Gy CRT plus 3 doses of intrathecal (i.t.) MTX and the latter patients received 3 courses of HDMTX at 2 g/m2 plus 13 doses of ITMTX (L874B) or 4 courses of HDMTX at 4.5 g/m2 plus 1 dose of ITMTX (I874B). RESULTS: The 7-year probabilities (+/- SE) of CNS relapse-free survival were 97.3% +/- 2.6% (L874A, n = 41) vs. 90.3% +/- 5.3% (L874B, n = 39) (P = 0.25) in the LR patients, and 100% (I874A, n = 55) vs. 78.5% +/- 6.5% (I874B, n = 54) (P = 0.002) in the IR patients. The corresponding disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 79.4% +/- 6.5% vs. 74.4% +/- 7.3% (P = 0.62) in the LR group and 63.3% +/- 6.8% vs. 58.3% +/- 7.2% (P = 0.66) in the IR group. Thus, the HDMTX regimen could not provide better protection of CNS relapse as compared with the CRT regimen, although their overall efficacy was not significantly different. In the ALL 911 study, intensive systemic chemotherapy with extended i,t, injections of MTX plus cytarabine achieved a high CNS relapse-free survival (98% +/- 1.9% at 7 years) and a favorable DFS (85.5% +/- 5% at 7 years) in the IR patients. The patients in the high-risk (HR) group in both ALL874 and ALL911 studies received the 18-Gy or 24-Gy CRT with intensive systemic chemotherapy. Their 7-year probabilities of CNS relapse-free survival ranged from 88% to 95%, among which the T-ALL patients had a risk of CNS leukemia, which was 3-4 times higher compared with B-precursor ALL patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that long-term intrathecal CNS prophylaxis as well as appropriate systemic therapy for the non-high-risk patients can provide protection against CNS relapse equivalent to that provided by cranial irradiation.","['Tsurusawa, M', 'Katano, N', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Hirota, T', 'Koizumi, S', 'Watanabe, A', 'Takeda, T', 'Hatae, Y', 'Yatabe, M', 'Mimaya, J', 'Gushiken, T', 'Nishi, K', 'Anami, K', 'Kikuta, A', 'Kanegane, H', 'Asami, K', 'Nishikawa, K', 'Sekine, I', 'Kawano, Y', 'Iwai, A', 'Furuyama, T', 'Ijichi, O', 'Miyake, M', 'Mugishima, H', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Tsurusawa M', 'Katano N', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Hirota T', 'Koizumi S', 'Watanabe A', 'Takeda T', 'Hatae Y', 'Yatabe M', 'Mimaya J', 'Gushiken T', 'Nishi K', 'Anami K', 'Kikuta A', 'Kanegane H', 'Asami K', 'Nishikawa K', 'Sekine I', 'Kawano Y', 'Iwai A', 'Furuyama T', 'Ijichi O', 'Miyake M', 'Mugishima H', 'Fujimoto T', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Japan. tsuru@aichi-med-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/04/02 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/02 03:02'],"['1999/04/02 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/02 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199904)32:4<259::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199904)32:4<259::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Apr;32(4):259-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199904)32:4<259::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: There were 23 events in these children with 3 progressive disease (PD), 8 partial remissions (PR), and 12 relapses. In the stage I patients, there were 8 events (35%). There was no association between the number of events and the stage of HD. Massive mediastinal disease at diagnosis was present in 16 patients, 11 of whom had an event with 3 PD, 3 PR, and 5 relapses. For all patients with an event at 6-24-month follow-up, all but two patients were salvaged with either alkylating agent-based chemotherapy alone or with irradiation and chemotherapy. The event-free survival for the whole group with median follow-up of 33 months was 59%, but only 31% for massive mediastinal disease. Disease-free survival was 78% and overall survival at 60 months was 92%, with one death due to drug-induced aplasia and another from acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that VEEP chemotherapy in childhood HD used as the only treatment modality has an unacceptably high treatment failure rate in patients with massive mediastinal disease and 35% incidence of treatment failure in stage I disease.","['Ekert, H', 'Toogood, I', 'Downie, P', 'Smith, P J', 'Macfarlane, S', 'White, L']","['Ekert H', 'Toogood I', 'Downie P', 'Smith PJ', 'Macfarlane S', 'White L']","[""Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. ekerth@cryptic.rch.unimelb.edu.au""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VEEP regimen']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Failure', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1999/04/02 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/04/02 03:02'],"['1999/04/02 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/04/02 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199904)32:4<255::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199904)32:4<255::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Apr;32(4):255-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199904)32:4<255::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: The Paediatric Oncology Unit at Parirenyatwa Teaching Hospital. SUBJECTS: 76 consecutive newly diagnosed cases of malignancy between May 15 and November 15 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV serostatus. RESULTS: 27 out of 64 children were HIV seropositive, giving a seroprevalance rate of 42.2% (95% CI 30.1 to 54.3%). The four commonest diagnosed malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (22.4%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (19.7%), Wilm's tumour (19.7%) and Kaposi's sarcoma (15.8%). These tumours accounted for 77.6% of all malignancies. Nine of a total of 17 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were HIV positive and all 12 patients with Kaposi's were also HIV positive. No cases of Burkitt's lymphoma were seen. Although there was increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) compared to previous years, there was no significant association with the HIV serostatus. A significant association between Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and HIV serostatus was observed (p < 0.001). Children with KS were more likely to be HIV seropositive. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilm's tumours (WT) were 83 and 88% less likely to be HIV seropositive, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HIV has transformed the pattern of childhood malignancy in Zimbabwe. The two tumours mostly affected are NHL and KS.","['Chitsike, I', 'Siziya, S']","['Chitsike I', 'Siziya S']","['Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Zimbabwe Medical School, Avondale, Harare, Zimbabwe.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Zimbabwe,Cent Afr J Med,The Central African journal of medicine,0372566,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications', '*HIV Seroprevalence', '*HIV-1', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*virology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*virology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*virology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Wilms Tumor/*virology', 'Zimbabwe']",1999/04/02 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1999/04/02 00:00'],"['1999/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cent Afr J Med. 1998 Oct;44(10):242-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Descriptive, retrospective study of clinical records of all CLL patients diagnosed at the Haematology clinics of the Universitas and Pelonomi Hospitals in Bloemfontein from 1975 to 1996. METHODS: Age, sex and race distribution of CLL patients were analysed. The peripheral blood, bone marrow, clinical presentation and stage at time of diagnosis, were studied. Treatment modalities, response to treatment and survival of patients were also analysed. Categorical variables were summarised by frequencies and percentages, and numerical variables by means of percentiles. Subgroup comparisons were done by 95% confidence intervals (CI) for differences in percentages, medians or means. RESULTS: A total of 185 CLL patients were studied. There were more males (62.7%) than females and the mean age of the patients was 63 years (19 to 98 years). Eighty six percent of the patients were older than 50 years. Racial distribution was as follow: 106 White, 77 Black and two patients of mixed race. Black patients more often presented with advanced disease and higher lymphocyte counts. A response to therapy was noted for 118 (82.5%) of the 143 patients who received treatment. A complete remission or partial response was noted for 38 (32.2%) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of CLL in the Bloemfontein academic hospitals is similar to what is seen world-wide. This is the first study describing CLL in a large number of Black patients and demonstrates that although Black patients presented more often at a younger age and had high risk disease, their clinical course and progression according to stage, also correlated with what is described in the literature.","['Nel, T', 'Joubert, G', 'van der Ryst, E', 'Bester, I']","['Nel T', 'Joubert G', 'van der Ryst E', 'Bester I']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Zimbabwe,Cent Afr J Med,The Central African journal of medicine,0372566,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Racial Groups', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'South Africa', 'Survival Analysis']",1999/04/02 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1999/04/02 00:00'],"['1999/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cent Afr J Med. 1998 Aug;44(8):195-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insights into the pathobiology of this disease have given rise to novel treatment strategies which exploit basic biological disturbances. Myelodysplastic bone marrow progenitors from patients with low leukaemia burden display an accelerated senescence phenotype which is characterised by impaired response to trophic signals and premature apoptotic death of primitive haematopoietic progenitors. Elaboration of aptogenic cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta may reinforce this sequence by up-regulating cellular expression of fas ligand and its cognate receptor, suppressing responsiveness to growth factor stimulation, and accelerating apoptotic cell death. Inactivation of p15 or other tumour suppressor genes antedate disease progression and the emergence of blast populations with reduced capacity for fas mediated cell death.

Distribution and regulation of LIF release.,834-41,"The distribution and regulation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its receptor (LIFR) in human lung tissue is unknown. We recently found that LIF was immunolocalized to several cell types in human airways, and that exogenous LIF modulated neural and contractile responses of explanted airways. The present study aimed to determine the cellular distribution and regulation of gene transcripts for LIF and LIFR in human lung, and measured the release of LIF in response to anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)E, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6. Exposure of human lung to IL-1beta (100 pg/ml) resulted in the rapid induction of LIF messenger RNA (mRNA) (1 h) and subsequent protein release (6 h). Similar results were observed when lung tissue was exposed to anti-IgE (6 U/ml). Gene transcripts for LIF were observed in nine pulmonary cell types, with the greatest expression occurring in fibroblasts. LIFR transcripts were also widely expressed in these cell types. In cultures of nontransformed epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, and airway smooth-muscle cells, IL-1beta (100 pg/ml) induced the rapid accumulation of LIF mRNA and protein release, with fibroblasts liberating the greatest amount. IL-6 also induced the expression of LIF mRNA and release of LIF in airway smooth-muscle cells, whereas exogenous LIF itself had no effect. Expression of LIFR mRNA was not influenced by exposure to IL-1beta or LIF in any of the cell lines used. These results highlight the widespread distribution and rapid release of LIF in human lung tissue and, in conjunction with our previous report, suggest that this cytokine may play an important role in lung inflammatory processes and neuroimmune interactions.","['Knight, D A', 'Lydell, C P', 'Zhou, D', 'Weir, T D', 'Robert Schellenberg, R', 'Bai, T R']","['Knight DA', 'Lydell CP', 'Zhou D', 'Weir TD', 'Robert Schellenberg R', 'Bai TR']","[""University of British Columbia Pulmonary Research Laboratory, St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Bronchi/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Endothelium, Vascular/immunology', 'Epithelial Cells/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lung/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/immunology', 'Pulmonary Artery/*immunology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/immunology']",1999/04/01 00:00,1999/04/01 00:01,['1999/04/01 00:00'],"['1999/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb.20.4.3429 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1999 Apr;20(4):834-41. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb.20.4.3429.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this Phase I study was to escalate targeted systemic exposure to paclitaxel, rather than dose, to attenuate the impact of pharmacokinetic variability at each escalation level. Children with recurrent acute leukemias received paclitaxel as 24-h infusions at escalating levels of paclitaxel systemic exposure [i.e., area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC)]. Plasma paclitaxel concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV detection. A Bayesian algorithm using a two-compartment model with saturable distribution and saturable elimination was used to estimate clearance during the first 8 h of infusion; the infusion rate was adjusted 12 h after the start of infusion to achieve the target AUC. Toxicity and evidence of activity were assessed after each course. Six boys and one girl received eight courses of paclitaxel. The target AUC ranged from 31.5 to 45 microM x h. Five of the seven evaluable courses had AUCs between 75% and 125% of the target after adjustment (median, 100.2%; range, 51-151%), whereas none of the seven courses was projected to be in the target range had no change in dose been made (P = 0.021). The ratio of the achieved AUC to the target AUC was inversely related to clearance (r = -0.857; P = 0.014). Mucositis was the exposure-limiting toxicity, at AUCs lower than were expected based on Phase I studies in children with solid tumors. Pharmacokinetically-guided dosing strategies reduced variability in systemic exposure. Alternatives to traditional Phase I studies may be important in the setting of childhood leukemias because these patients show poor tolerance to Phase I therapy.","['Woo, M H', 'Relling, M V', 'Sonnichsen, D S', 'Rivera, G K', 'Pratt, C B', 'Pui, C H', 'Evans, W E', 'Pappo, A S']","['Woo MH', 'Relling MV', 'Sonnichsen DS', 'Rivera GK', 'Pratt CB', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE', 'Pappo AS']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Paclitaxel/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1999/04/01 00:00,1999/04/01 00:01,['1999/04/01 00:00'],"['1999/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Mar;5(3):543-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to analyze the therapeutic role of IFN alpha in this setting. The experience of a single institution and the published results on this topic were evaluated. We have included patients who received IFN alpha as a single agent, excluding those patients who received previous or simultaneous donor leukocyte infusions. The outcomes of 11 patients treated in our center and those of 108 previously reported patients have been analyzed. Five out of 11 patients treated in our institution obtained a complete cytogenetic response (CGR). Two patients continue in complete cytogenetic response 3.5 and 8.2 years later, and the qualitative RT-PCR is negative for bcr-abl RNA. The CGR has been transient in one patient, and follow-up is short in the other two. Secondary effects have been acceptable, with myelosuppression as the main toxic effect. Graft-versus-host disease did not occur. The literature review identified 108 patients treated with IFN alpha as sole therapy for relapsed CML. Cytogenetic response and CGR seem to be better in patients with cytogenetic relapse, as compared to patients with hematologic relapse (61% vs. 45% and 45% vs. 28%, respectively). Several patients remained in CGR for more than 5 years. This overview also suggests that CGR is more frequent when IFN alpha is used in patients relapsing after non T-depleted BMT. IFN alpha induces complete cytogenetic response in nearly half of the patients with CML who relapse after allogeneic BMT, with acceptable toxicity. We believe that these results using IFN alpha as a front-line therapy for CML relapsing after BMT warrant a randomized comparison with donor lymphocyte infusions.","['Steegmann, J L', 'Casado, L F', 'Tomas, J F', 'Sanz-Rodriguez, C', 'Granados, E', 'de la Camara, R', 'Alegre, A', 'Vazquez, L', 'Ferro, M T', 'Figuera, A', 'Arranz, R', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Steegmann JL', 'Casado LF', 'Tomas JF', 'Sanz-Rodriguez C', 'Granados E', 'de la Camara R', 'Alegre A', 'Vazquez L', 'Ferro MT', 'Figuera A', 'Arranz R', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/04/01 00:00,1999/04/01 00:01,['1999/04/01 00:00'],"['1999/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701607 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Mar;23(5):483-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimaerism was assessed by PCR amplification of VNTRs in 30 evaluable patients: 19 non-CML and 11 CML cases which were also evaluated for the BCR-ABL transcript by RT-PCR. All but one had complete engraftment with a donor profile early post-BMT. At the end of the study period, 12 of 30 patients displayed MC (40%). The overall disease-free survival for MC patients was clearly unfavourable when compared to those who exhibited a donor profile (24.7% vs. 100%, P = 0.005). However, we found that only two of five patients with MC in the non-CML group relapsed, whereas a clear correlation could be made between MC and relapse in CML (seven showed MC, preceding cytogenetic or haematological relapse in six of them, which displayed a prior BCR-ABL mRNA positivity). In addition, a quantitative-PCR approach enabled us to demonstrate that increasing amounts of MC are invariably associated with subsequent relapse, whereas a low stable level of host or complete donor haemopoiesis is consistent with clinical complete remission. Although these results suggest that the clinical impact of MC may depend on the underlying disease, it is compatible with the concept that the graft-versus-leukaemia effect against CML is mainly exerted by donor CD4+ lymphocytes.

Total depletion of CD4+ and partial depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes was carried out by an immunomagnetical method. All patients were considered as having high risk for developing GVHD by at least one of the following criteria: patient age >35 years; donor age >35 years; donor multiparity or marrow from an unrelated donor. Twenty-four cases received marrow from an identical sibling and six from an unrelated donor. In order to assess the role of methotrexate (MTX) in addition to cyclosporin A (CsA) after transplant, patients were randomly assigned to received either CsA alone (n = 15) or CsA plus a short course of MTX (n = 15). No case of primary graft failure was observed, but two patients developed late graft failure. Six patients presented grade II acute GVHD and no case of severe III-IV GVHD was seen. The actuarial probability of developing grade II-IV acute GVHD was 25.9+/-9.6% for the entire population. Patients receiving post-transplant CsA + MTX had significantly less probability of acute GVHD than those receiving CsA exclusively (6.7+/-6.4% vs. 50.5+/-17.8%, P = 0.03) and the schedule of post-transplant immunosuppression was the only factor associated with the incidence of acute GVHD in a multivariate analysis. The actuarial incidence of chronic GVHD for the entire population was 31.8+/-12.5, and there was no significant difference between both groups with additional prophylaxis. Four patients with CML and three with ANLL relapsed: the actuarial probability of remaining in complete remission for all patients was 53.6+/-17.3%. For patients with acute leukemia, the probability of remaining in complete remission did not differ significantly between those transplanted in first complete remission and those receiving a transplant in more advanced phases of the disease (87.5+/-11.6% vs. 72.9+/-16.5%; P = 0.44). The incidence of mixed chimerism assessed by PCR was 34%. Nineteen patients are alive between 2 and 43 months post-transplant, the probability of overall survival being 57.8+/-10.4%.

Serum samples were obtained from all patients before treatment and after cessation of the therapy from malignant lymphoma cases and during remission from leukemic patients. Twelve age-matched healthy children were included as a control group. The serum ICAM-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD) than those in the control group (median values: 350.9, 286.4, and 138.4 ng/mL, respectively; P < .01 in each comparison). However, there were no significant differences concerning serum ICAM-1 levels between the control group and each of the acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) case groups (median values: 235.7, 222.7, 195.9, and 138.4 ng/mL, respectively; P > .05 in each comparison). Moreover, serum soluble ICAM-1 levels significantly declined in ALL or HD patients who were in complete remission (median values: 185.0 and 145.4 ng/mL, respectively; P < .05 in each comparison). In HD patients high levels of serum ICAM-1 could be correlated with high ESR (P < .01), whereas no statistically significant difference could be found when serum ICAM-1 titers were compared with stages, B symptoms, and histological subgroups, probably because of the inadequate number of patients in each group. Expression of ICAM-1 was mainly attributed to lymphocytes, vessels, and weakly to Hodgkin's cells, and this was significantly high in patients who were in advanced stages of disease. High serum sICAM-1 level was also associated with poor outcome and survival. Determination of serum level and/or tumor tissue expression of ICAM-1 in HD and ALL might represent an additional, but probably not independent, disease-associated marker to be used in the evaluation and/or monitoring of treatment response in patients with HD and ALL.","['Tacyildiz, N', 'Yavuz, G', 'Gozdasoglu, S', 'Unal, E', 'Ertem, U', 'Duru, F', 'Ikinciogullari, A', 'Babacan, E', 'Ensari, A', 'Okcuoglu-Cavdar, A']","['Tacyildiz N', 'Yavuz G', 'Gozdasoglu S', 'Unal E', 'Ertem U', 'Duru F', 'Ikinciogullari A', 'Babacan E', 'Ensari A', 'Okcuoglu-Cavdar A']","['Ankara University Department of Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate']",1999/04/01 00:00,1999/04/01 00:01,['1999/04/01 00:00'],"['1999/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/088800199277470 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1999 Mar-Apr;16(2):149-58. doi: 10.1080/088800199277470.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six healthy adult volunteers were studied for controls. WT1 was detectable in 7 out of 10 ALLs and all 3 AMLs, but not in 2 ALLs in remission and the controls. The expression levels were higher for AMLs than for ALLs. According to the types of ALL, WT1 was detectable in 2 out of 2 non-T group II, 4 out of 6 non-T group III, but not in one CD20+ non-T group IV, while one T-ALL showed a relatively high level. WT1 expression was detectable more frequently in ALL-L2 than in ALL-L1 and with higher levels for ALL-L2. WT1 expression was frequently noted in children with acute leukemia.

In contrast, in terms of CD13 receptor content, HL60 cells agitated at 300 rpm with Methocel A15LV, PEG, or PVA behaved like cells agitated at 80 rpm with no media additives (McDowell and Papoutsakis, 1998). That is, Methocel A15LV, PEG, and PVA prevented the transduction of mechanical forces which affect CD13 cell content. HL60 cells cultured with 0.1% A15LV, PEG or PVA under conditions of mild agitation (60 rpm) in spinner flasks exhibited glucose consumption and lactate production rates that were approximately 20% lower than values of cultures containing no additive. Under conditions of agitation at 300 rpm in the 2 L bioreactor, the presence of A15LV, PEG, and PVA reduced the HL60 glucose consumption and lactate production rates by approximately 50%.

METHODS: We studied a newly described receptor for fibrinolytic proteins, annexin II, in cells from patients with APL or other leukemias. We examined initial rates of in vitro generation of plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in the presence of APL cells that did or did not have the characteristic translocation of APL, t(15;17). We also determined the effect of all-trans-retinoic acid on the expression of annexin II and the generation of cell-surface plasmin. RESULTS: The expression of annexin II, as detected by a fluorescein-tagged antibody, was greater on leukemic cells from patients with APL than on other types of leukemic cells (mean fluorescence intensity, 6.9 and 2.9, respectively; P<0.01). The t(15;17)-positive APL cells stimulated the generation of cell-surface, t-PA-dependent plasmin twice as efficiently as the t(15;17)-negative cells. This increase in plasmin was blocked by an anti-annexin II antibody and was induced by transfection of t(15;17)-negative cells with annexin II complementary DNA. The t(15;17)-positive APL cells contained abundant messenger RNA for annexin II, which disappeared through a transcriptional mechanism after treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormally high levels of expression of annexin II on APL cells increase the production of plasmin, a fibrinolytic protein. Overexpression of annexin II may be a mechanism for the hemorrhagic complications of APL.","['Menell, J S', 'Cesarman, G M', 'Jacovina, A T', 'McLaughlin, M A', 'Lev, E A', 'Hajjar, K A']","['Menell JS', 'Cesarman GM', 'Jacovina AT', 'McLaughlin MA', 'Lev EA', 'Hajjar KA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA. menellj@sjhmc.org']",['eng'],"['HL 42493/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 46403/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 58981/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Annexin A2/drug effects/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antibodies/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibrinolysin/*biosynthesis', 'Fibrinolysis/drug effects/immunology', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/04/01 00:00,1999/04/01 00:01,['1999/04/01 00:00'],"['1999/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199904013401303 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1999 Apr 1;340(13):994-1004. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199904013401303.,,,['N Engl J Med. 1999 Apr 1;340(13):1035-6.

Various attempts to design antisense oligonucleotides that specifically cleave abnormal L6 BCR-ABL fusion mRNA have not been successful. Because b2a2 mRNA cannot be effectively cleaved by hammerhead ribozymes near the BCR-ABL junction, it has proved very difficult to engineer specific cleavage of this chimeric mRNA. Nonspecific effects associated with using antisense molecules make the use of such antisense molecules questionable. RESULTS: The usefulness of DNA enzymes in specifically suppressing expression of L6 BCR-ABL mRNA in mammalian cells is demonstrated. Although the efficacy of DNA enzymes with natural linkages decreased 12 hours after transfection, partially modified DNA enzymes, with either phosphorothioate or 2'-O-methyl groups at both their 5' and 3' ends, remained active for much longer times in mammalian cells. Moreover, the DNA enzyme with only 2'-O-methyl modifications was also highly specific for abnormal mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: DNA enzymes with 2'-O-methyl modifications are potentially useful as gene-inactivating agents in the treatment of diseases such as CML. In contrast to conventional antisense DNAs, some of the DNA enzymes used in this study were highly specific and cleaved only abnormal BCR-ABL mRNA.","['Warashina, M', 'Kuwabara, T', 'Nakamatsu, Y', 'Taira, K']","['Warashina M', 'Kuwabara T', 'Nakamatsu Y', 'Taira K']","['National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research, AIST, Tsukuba Science City 305-8562, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1999/04/01 00:00,1999/04/01 00:01,['1999/04/01 00:00'],"['1999/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1074-5521(99)80039-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80039-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 1999 Apr;6(4):237-50. doi: 10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80039-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cancer mortality rate was 5% lower than that of England and Wales and 3% less than that of Cumbria. The significant excesses of deaths from cancer of the pleura and thyroid found in an earlier study persist with further follow-up (14 observed, 4.0 expected for pleura; 6 observed, 2.2 expected for thyroid). All of the deaths from pleural cancer were among radiation workers. For neither site was there a significant association between the risk of the cancer and accumulated radiation dose. There were significant deficits of deaths from cancers of mouth and pharynx, liver and gall bladder, and larynx and leukaemia when compared with the national rates. Among all radiation workers, there was a significant positive association between accumulated external radiation dose and mortality from cancers of ill-defined and secondary sites (10-year lag, P = 0.04), leukaemia (no lag, P = 0.03; 2-year lag, P = 0.05), multiple myeloma (20-year lag, P = 0.02), all lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers (20-year lag, P= 0.03) and all causes of death combined (20-year lag, P= 0.008). Among plutonium workers, there were significant excesses of deaths from cancer of the breast (6 observed, 2.6 expected) and ill-defined and secondary cancers (29 observed, 20.1 expected). No significant positive trends were observed between the risk of deaths from cancers of any specific site, or all cancers combined, and cumulative plutonium and external radiation doses. For no cancer site was there a significant excess of cancer registrations compared with rates for England and Wales. Analysis of trends in cancer incidence showed significant increases in risk with cumulative plutonium plus external radiation doses for all lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms for 0-, 10- and 20-year lag periods. Taken as a whole, our findings do not suggest that workers at Sellafield who have been exposed to plutonium are at an overall significantly increased risk of cancer compared with other radiation workers.","['Omar, R Z', 'Barber, J A', 'Smith, P G']","['Omar RZ', 'Barber JA', 'Smith PG']","['London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['53023GN24M (Plutonium)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Electric Power Supplies', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality/urine', '*Nuclear Energy', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality/urine', 'Organ Specificity', 'Plutonium/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Tissue Distribution', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1999/03/31 00:00,1999/03/31 00:01,['1999/03/31 00:00'],"['1999/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690207 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(7-8):1288-301. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690207.,PMC2362215,,,,,,,,,,['Br J Cancer 1999 Apr;79(11-12):1946'],,,,,,,,

Here we have studied the frequency of detection of p53 mutations at relapse of both AML and B-precursor ALL. In those patients with detectable mutations at relapse we investigated whether the mutation was detectable at presentation and was thus an early initiating event or whether it had arisen as a late event associated with relapse. Bone marrow samples from 55 adults and children with relapsed AML (n = 41) or ALL (n = 14) were analysed for p53 gene alterations by direct sequencing of exons 5-9. For samples where a p53 mutation was found at relapse, analysis of presentation samples was carried out by direct sequencing of the exon involved, or by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the mutation could not be detected using direct sequencing. A p53 mutated gene was found at relapse in seven out of 55 cases. The frequency was higher in relapsed ALL (four out of 14 cases; 28.6%) compared to AML (three out of 41 cases; 7.3%). In five out of the seven cases presentation samples were available to study for the presence of the mutation. In two out of two AML patients the p53 mutation was detectable in the presentation sample by direct sequencing. In three ALL patients analysis of presentation material by direct sequencing showed a small mutant peak in one case, the other two being negative despite the sample analysed containing > 90% blast cells. However in both of these patients, the presence of p53 mutation was confirmed in the presentation sample using allele-specific PCR. In one of these patients the emergence of a subclone at relapse was confirmed by clonality analysis using IgH fingerprinting. Our results confirm that in ALL p53 mutations are present in a proportion of patients at relapse. Furthermore cells carrying the mutation are detectable at presentation in a minor clone suggesting that p53 mutations in ALL may be a mechanism contributing to disease relapse.","['Zhu, Y M', 'Foroni, L', 'McQuaker, I G', 'Papaioannou, M', 'Haynes, A', 'Russell, H H']","['Zhu YM', 'Foroni L', 'McQuaker IG', 'Papaioannou M', 'Haynes A', 'Russell HH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, University of Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/03/31 00:00,1999/03/31 00:01,['1999/03/31 00:00'],"['1999/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690183 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(7-8):1151-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690183.,PMC2362216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been attributed to expression of functional P-glycoprotein resulting in reduced drug accumulation. However, it has also been proposed that P-glycoprotein-expressing multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells are inherently defective for apoptosis. To distinguish between these different possibilities, we have compared the cell death process in a human AML cell line (HL-60) with a MDR subline (HL-60/Vinc) at doses that yield either similar intracellular daunorubicin concentrations or comparable cytotoxicity. Adjustment of the dose to obtain the same intracellular drug accumulation in the two cell lines did not result in equal cytotoxicity, suggesting the presence of additional resistance mechanisms in the P-glycoprotein-expressing HL-60/Vinc cells. However, at equitoxic doses, similar cell death pathways were observed. In HL-60 cells, daunorubicin induced rapid apoptosis at 0.5-1 microM and delayed mitotic cell death at 0.1 microM. These concentrations are within the clinical dose range. Similarly, HL-60/Vinc cells underwent apoptosis at 50-100 microM daunorubicin and mitotic cell death at 10 microM. These results show, for the first time, that anthracyclines can induce cell death by a dual mechanism in both sensitive and MDR cells. Our results also show that not only the cytotoxicity, but also the kinetics and mechanism of cell death, are dose dependent. Interestingly, regrowth was observed only in association with delayed cell death and the formation of enlarged, often polyploid, cells with micronucleation, suggesting that morphological criteria may be useful to evaluate treatment efficacy in patients with myeloid leukaemias.","['Come, M G', 'Skladanowski, A', 'Larsen, A K', 'Laurent, G']","['Come MG', 'Skladanowski A', 'Larsen AK', 'Laurent G']","['CJF INSERM 9503, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Area Under Curve', '*Cell Death', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism']",1999/03/31 00:00,1999/03/31 00:01,['1999/03/31 00:00'],"['1999/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690174 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(7-8):1090-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690174.,PMC2362243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of CD26 on leukaemic B-cells (CD20+ CD23+) was clearly induced in 22 out of 25 patients examined. Consequently, induced levels of CD26 cell surface expression on either normal activated and malignant B-cells coincided with the enhancement of DPP IV activity detected on the surface of these cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the transcript levels of the CD26 gene was higher in normal activated B-cells and B-CLL cells than in resting B-cells, suggesting that CD26 was expressed at the level of transcriptional activation.

Most CML cells are sensitive to IFN-alpha; however, its biological effects on leukaemic cells are incompletely characterized. Here, we provide evidence that IFN-alpha induces a significant increase in the S phase population in human CML leukaemic cell line, K562, and that the S phase accumulation was augmented by sodium butyrate. In contrast, neither sodium butyrate alone, nor sodium butyrate plus IFN-gamma, affected the cell cycle in K562 cells. These data suggest that the effect of sodium butyrate depended upon IFN-alpha-mediated signalling. The ability of leukaemic cells to exhibit the S phase accumulation after stimulation by IFN-alpha plus sodium butyrate correlated well with persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2, whereas treatment with IFN-gamma plus sodium butyrate did not affect its phosphorylation levels. Considering that dephosphorylation of cdc2 leads to entry to the M phase, the persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2 may be associated with the S phase accumulation induced by IFN-alpha and sodium butyrate. In addition, another human CML leukaemic cell line, MEG-01, also showed the S phase accumulation after stimulation with IFN-alpha plus sodium butyrate. Taken together, our studies reveal a novel effect of sodium butyrate on the S phase accumulation and suggest its clinical application for a combination therapy with IFN-alpha, leading to a great improvement of clinical effects of IFN-alpha against CML cells.","['Miyachi, T', 'Adachi, M', 'Hinoda, Y', 'Imai, K']","['Miyachi T', 'Adachi M', 'Hinoda Y', 'Imai K']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1999/03/31 00:00,1999/03/31 00:01,['1999/03/31 00:00'],"['1999/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690163 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(7-8):1018-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690163.,PMC2362223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the expression of LIF in normal rat pituitary could be demonstrated by ribonuclease protection assay. LIF (1 nM) caused a slight, but significant increase in ACTH secretion (43.7% increase versus control, P<0.01), while showing statistically no significant change of growth hormone and prolactin level in dispersed rat pituitary cells. CRH (10 nM) also induced ACTH secretion 2.5-fold (P<0.01), and co-treatment of LIF and CRH exhibited 2.8-fold increase of ACTH secretion but no statistical difference from CRH treated group. These findings suggest that LIF also has same enhancing effect of ACTH secretion in primary pituitary cultured cells of rat as in AtT-20 cell and LIF acts as a paracrine or autocrine factor to modulate neuroendocrine function in the pituitary.","['Kim, D S', 'Melmed, S']","['Kim DS', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Endocr Res,Endocrine research,8408548,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Growth Hormone/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pituitary Gland/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Prolactin/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred WF', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1999/03/31 00:00,1999/03/31 00:01,['1999/03/31 00:00'],"['1999/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07435809909066125 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr Res. 1999 Feb;25(1):11-9. doi: 10.1080/07435809909066125.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now describe the role of interleukin (IL)-11, another member of the IL-6 cytokine family, in the neuro-immuno-endocrine modulation of the HPA axis. In murine hypothalamus, pituitary and corticotroph AtT-20 cells, IL-11 messenger RNA (mRNA) was detectable by RT-PCR only, whereas IL-11R mRNA transcripts were demonstrated by Northern blot. Using RT-PCR, IL-11 and IL-11R gene expression were also detected in normal human pituitaries, as well as in corticotropic and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Incubation of AtT-20 cells for 24 h with 10(-9) M IL-11 stimulated ACTH secretion 1.4 +/- 0.1-fold (P < 0.01), whereas LIF at the same concentration caused a 1.5 +/- 0.1-fold increase (P < 0.001). POMC mRNA expression was induced by IL-11 (0.5 x 10(-9) M) and LIF (0.5 x 10(-9) M) 1.5 +/- 0.18-fold (P < 0.05) and 1.7 +/- 0.13-fold (P < 0.01), respectively. POMC promoter activity, assayed by a -706/+64 rat POMC promoter-luciferase construct, was stimulated by 0.5 x 10(-9) M IL-11 (1.9 +/- 0.06-fold; P < 0.001) and 5 mM Bu2cAMP (7.1 +/- 0.52-fold, P < 0.001), and combined treatment of IL-11 plus Bu2cAMP caused a synergistic 11.7+/-0.71-fold increase ofluciferase activity (P < 0.001 vs. Bu2cAMP alone). Gene expression of SOCS-3, an intracellular inhibitor of cytokine action, peaked as early as 60 min after incubation with IL-11 (0.5 x 10(-9) M) and was induced 3.5-fold. In comparison to mock-transfected AtT-20 cells (AtT-20M), stable overexpression of SOCS-3 (AtT-20S) resulted in significant inhibition of ACTH secretion induced by IL-11 alone (1.5 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.04-fold induction, P < 0.01) and IL-11 plus Bu2cAMP (2.1 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.06-fold, P < 0.05), but not by Bu2cAMP alone (1.5 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.06). In summary, human and murine pituitary express IL-11 and IL-11R transcripts. In murine corticotroph AtT-20 cells, IL- 11 induces POMC gene transcription and ACTH secretion. IL-11 induction of SOCS-3 indicates an intracellular negative feedback control of cytokine-induced POMC expression and ACTH secretion. Thus, IL-11 regulates the HPA axis similarly to LIF, providing further evidence for a redundant cytokine network in the neuro-immuno-endocrine regulation of the HPA axis.","['Auernhammer, C J', 'Melmed, S']","['Auernhammer CJ', 'Melmed S']","['Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['DK-50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs3 protein, rat)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",IM,"['Adenoma/chemistry', 'Adrenal Glands/*physiology', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/*physiology', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pituitary Gland/*physiology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/31 00:00,1999/03/31 00:01,['1999/03/31 00:00'],"['1999/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.140.4.6636 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1999 Apr;140(4):1559-66. doi: 10.1210/endo.140.4.6636.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typical treatment involves addressing the underlying cause if possible; eliminating nonessential and/or other drugs that can worsen confusion, manipulating the environment; and administering antipsychotic drugs to control symptoms and agitated behavior, and attempt to clear the patient's sensorium. The newer atypical antipsychotics may have potential in the treatment of delirium and also have the added benefit of causing less akithisia and other extrapyramidal side effects. This is illustrated by the case of a 59-year-old woman with leukemia and pain of unclear etiology who developed a delirium and a moderate to severe extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) in the setting of escalation of her pain medications and concomitant escalation of prochlorperazine. The patient presented with confusion and moderate to severe cogwheeling rigidity, masked facies, bradykinesia, and tremor. Additionally, the patient had a relatively recent history of subdural hematoma and one seizure. Conservative management including eliminating multiple nonessential medications (including the prochlorperazine); changing her opioid analgesic; providing a 24-hour companion: and administering low doses of haloperidol (0.5 mg-2.0 mg) were not effective in treating the patient's delirium. The patient's EPS was dramatically worse following haloperidol doses. After approximately I week without improvement, the patient was started on olanzapine 5 mg daily with initial improvement but with residual confusion in the evenings and overnight. The dose was titrated up to 10 mg nightly with 2.5 mg as needed during the day. After 3 days on this regimen, the patient's mental status exam was normal and she was discharged home.

There were large differences in the results of CD marker analysis among the six commercial laboratories. One possible reason for this result is the differences in gating condition and monoclonal antibodies used in each laboratory. However, there were the differences in the results even when the same gating condition and antibodies were used. The reasons for the difference in transport or treatment conditions for samples remain a matter of considerable controversy. In the present condition, it was suggested that the exchange of information about the origin of tumor cells between the physician in charge and examination experts is thought to be the best way to analyze proper cell surface antigen expression. Further, no national survey has been carried out, but the establishment of a standard assay is preferred to obtain proper data for the patients and medical parties concerned.","['Sato, K', 'Kimura, T', 'Araake, H', 'Kida, T', 'Kobayashi, D', 'Yagihashi, A', 'Kudoh, T', 'Sakamaki, S', 'Watanabe, N']","['Sato K', 'Kimura T', 'Araake H', 'Kida T', 'Kobayashi D', 'Yagihashi A', 'Kudoh T', 'Sakamaki S', 'Watanabe N']","['Dept. of Laboratory Diagnosis, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Previous studies have suggested that 2B4 is an activating molecule because cross-linking of this receptor results in increased cytotoxicity and gamma-interferon secretion as well as granule exocytosis. However, it was recently shown that the gene for 2B4 encodes two different products that arise by alternative splicing. These gene products differ solely in their cytoplasmic domains. One form has a cytoplasmic tail of 150 amino acids (2B4L) and the other has a tail of 93 amino acids (2B4S). To determine the function of each receptor, cDNAs for 2B4S and 2B4L were transfected into the rat NK cell line RNK-16. Interestingly, the two forms of 2B4 had opposing functions. 2B4S was able to mediate redirected lysis of P815 tumor targets, suggesting that this form represents an activating receptor. However, 2B4L expression led to an inhibition of redirected lysis of P815 targets when the mAb 3.2.3 (specific for rat NKRP1) was used. In addition, 2B4L constitutively inhibits lysis of YAC-1 tumor targets. 2B4L is a tyrosine phosphoprotein, and removal of domains containing these residues abrogates its inhibitory function. Like other inhibitory receptors, 2B4L associates with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Thus, 2B4L is an inhibitory receptor belonging to the Ig superfamily.","['Schatzle, J D', 'Sheu, S', 'Stepp, S E', 'Mathew, P A', 'Bennett, M', 'Kumar, V']","['Schatzle JD', 'Sheu S', 'Stepp SE', 'Mathew PA', 'Bennett M', 'Kumar V']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75235-9072, USA. schatzle.john@pathology.utswmed.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA036922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 25041/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 38938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cd244 protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Exocytosis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/31 00:00,1999/03/31 00:01,['1999/03/31 00:00'],"['1999/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.7.3870 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 30;96(7):3870-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.7.3870.,PMC22387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, 7 patients without ATL cell invasion into the lungs did not demonstrate any significant reactivity.

Two groups of patients, with 22 and 41 participants with B-cell and T-cell lymphoma, respectively, were analyzed. HTLV-I antibodies were detected in 24 (59%) patients with T-cell lymphoma of whom 19 (46%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). By comparison with other T-cell lymphomas, patients with ATLL were significantly younger (52 versus 63 years; p = .03), had a significantly higher incidence of hypercalcemia (60% versus 0%; p = .0001), a trend for higher incidence of digestive tract localization (21% versus 4%; p = .1) and significantly shorter median survival (6 versus 17 months; p = .03). Similar results were observed when all 24 HTLV-I-infected patients with T-cell lymphoma were compared with the 17 seronegative patients. Strongyloidiasis was diagnosed in 11 of 34 patients tested for Ss infection. All 4 Ss-infected (Ss-positive) ATLL patients treated with combination chemotherapy achieved complete remission (CR) versus only 2 of 7 Ss-negative ATLL patients (p = .04). In addition, survival of Ss-positive patients with ATLL was better than that of the uninfected patients: 27 versus 5 months, p = .04, respectively). P53 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry on lymph node biopsies from 37 patients including 18 B-cell lymphomas, 14 ATLL, and 5 other T-cell lymphomas. P53 overexpression (P53-positive) was observed in 6 samples that corresponded in all 6 patients with ATLL. All P53-positive ATLL patients had stage IV disease with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. By comparison with other ATLL patients studied for p53 expression, P53-positive ATLL were characterized by a lower response rate to combination chemotherapy (CR: 0 of 6 versus 4 of 6; p = .04) and a shorter survival (2 versus 9 months, p = .04). Our results suggest that ATLL represents almost 50% of T-cell lymphomas in Martinique; Ss infection during ATLL seems to be linked with a high response rate to chemotherapy and prolonged survival; and P53 overexpression is observed in almost 50% of aggressive ATLL from Martinique and, even in advanced clinical subtypes, is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and short-term survival.","['Agape, P', 'Copin, M C', 'Cavrois, M', 'Panelatti, G', 'Plumelle, Y', 'Ossondo-Landeau, M', 'Quist, D', 'Grossat, N', 'Gosselin, B', 'Fenaux, P', 'Wattel, E']","['Agape P', 'Copin MC', 'Cavrois M', 'Panelatti G', 'Plumelle Y', 'Ossondo-Landeau M', 'Quist D', 'Grossat N', 'Gosselin B', 'Fenaux P', 'Wattel E']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Haut-Leveque, CHU Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', '*Endemic Diseases', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Martinique/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Strongyloides stercoralis', 'Strongyloidiasis/*complications', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis']",1999/03/30 00:00,1999/03/30 00:01,['1999/03/30 00:00'],"['1999/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199904010-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1999 Apr 1;20(4):394-402. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199904010-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether positive autoregulation is a necessary component of glucocorticoid-induced cell death, a wild-type GR gene under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter was stably transfected into glucocorticoid-resistant cells lacking endogenous functional receptor. Transfectants grown in the presence of tetracycline contained about 15,000 receptors/cell, a value approximately equal to basal level GR expression in glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 cells before steroid treatment. Under these conditions, dexamethasone had a minimal effect on cell growth, elicited little internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and induced no cell cycle perturbation. In the absence of tetracycline, GR mRNA and protein expression increased 2-3-fold, and cells expressed 48,000 receptors, a level nearly equivalent to that present in 6TG1.1 cells after 18 h of autoinduction. Under these conditions, dexamethasone markedly inhibited cell growth, caused G1 arrest, and induced significant internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. These studies therefore suggest that basal level GR expression is inadequate to mediate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in glucocorticoid-sensitive T cells and that positive autoregulation is a necessary component of this process.","['Ramdas, J', 'Liu, W', 'Harmon, J M']","['Ramdas J', 'Liu W', 'Harmon JM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4799, USA.']",['eng'],['CA32226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/30 00:00,1999/03/30 00:01,['1999/03/30 00:00'],"['1999/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Mar 15;59(6):1378-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a 6-h exposure to 1 microM ara-C, cells stably transfected with a p21WAF1/CIP1 antisense construct were significantly more sensitive to the induction of classic apoptotic morphology, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, and underphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) than their empty-vector counterparts. Enhanced susceptibility of antisense-expressing cells to ara-C was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in clonogenic and suspension culture growth. The increased sensitivity of these cells to ara-C-mediated lethality could not be attributed to cytokinetic perturbations, nor did ara-CTP formation or (ara-C)DNA incorporation differ significantly between the cell lines. Moreover, synchronization of p21 antisense-expressing cells in S-phase by aphidicolin block resulted in a further increase in ara-C-mediated apoptosis, suggesting enhanced drug sensitivity of the S-phase cell fraction. After exposure to ara-C, p21 antisense-expressing cells displayed a greater decline in mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) and generation of reactive oxygen species than their empty-vector counterparts, as well as early potentiation (e.g., within 2-4 h) of cytochrome c release into the cytosolic S-100 fraction. Lastly, ara-C-mediated increases in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity over basal levels were attenuated in p21 antisense-expressing cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that dysregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 increases the susceptibility of U937 human leukemia cells to ara-C-related lethality, and this phenomenon occurs as a relatively early event that is independent of cell cycle or pharmacodynamic factors and is associated with mitochondrial perturbations implicated in activation of the apoptotic protease cascade.","['Wang, Z', 'Van Tuyle, G', 'Conrad, D', 'Fisher, P B', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Wang Z', 'Van Tuyle G', 'Conrad D', 'Fisher PB', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298-0230, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",1999/03/30 00:00,1999/03/30 00:01,['1999/03/30 00:00'],"['1999/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Mar 15;59(6):1259-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term daily dosing with gossypol is associated with minimal side effects and no myelosuppression. Since gossypol exhibits atropisomerism due to the restricted rotation about the 2,2' carbon bond, we have isolated the l- and d-isomers by Schiff's base formation using a chiral amine and regenerated the enantiomers by acid hydrolysis. The enantiomers and the proposed oxidative metabolite, gossypolone, were characterized by HPLC, 1H-NMR and optical rotation. The cytotoxicity was assessed in cell cultures derived from melanoma, lung, breast, cervix, and leukaemia using the MTT viability assay. The cytotoxicity of gossypolone was similar to racemic gossypol in five out of the six cell lines studied. The l-enantiomer of gossypol induced a dose-dependent cell kill in all cell lines with a mean IC50 of 20 microM and was significantly more potent than racemic gossypol, the d-enantiomer of gossypol and gossypolone. In addition, when the leukaemia line was exposed to l-gossypol (0.5-10 microM) over a 4-day period, a schedule-dependent decrease in cell viability was observed. l-Gossypol was also compared with respective drugs used to treat patients with melanoma, lung cancer and leukaemia. The data indicate that l-gossypol was significantly more active than cisplatin, melphalan and dacarbazine in the two melanoma lines, cisplatin and daunorubicin in the lung line and hydroxyurea and busulphan in the leukaemia line. Preliminary studies using one melanoma line showed that the l-isomer induced cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation, characteristics suggestive of apoptotic cell death.","['Shelley, M D', 'Hartley, L', 'Fish, R G', 'Groundwater, P', 'Morgan, J J', 'Mort, D', 'Mason, M', 'Evans, A']","['Shelley MD', 'Hartley L', 'Fish RG', 'Groundwater P', 'Morgan JJ', 'Mort D', 'Mason M', 'Evans A']","['Research Laboratories, Velindre NHS Trust Hospital, Whitchurch, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4547-72-2 (gossypolone)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1999/03/30 00:00,1999/03/30 00:01,['1999/03/30 00:00'],"['1999/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(98)00302-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00302-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1999 Jan 29;135(2):171-80. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00302-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current studies were undertaken to examine the effect of benzene, a bone marrow toxin and human leukemogen, on DNAPC levels in mouse bone marrow cells. Using a K+/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) precipitation assay for DNAPC determination, the results indicate increased DNA-protein cross-link levels in mouse bone marrow cells at 2 and 4 but not 8 h after a single ip injection of 440 mg/kg benzene. Following the administration of multiple hematotoxic benzene doses (440 or 880 mg/kg, 2x/d for 2 d), increases in DNA-protein cross-link levels were either slight or not present. These results suggest that DNAPC induced by benzene are neither cumulative nor persistent lesions. The toxicity of benzene is mediated by a number of number of ring-hydroxylated and ring-opened compounds; therefore the present studies also examined DNAPC levels in mice administered trans,trans-muconaldehyde (MUC), a ring-opened hematotoxic and genotoxic metabolite of benzene. No marked increases in DNAPC levels were observed in CD- mouse bone marrow cells 1-12 h following a single ip injection of 3 mg/kg muconaldehyde. It is possible that multiple doses of MUC are required to induce elevated DNAPC levels in bone marrow cells of mice, since multiple doses are required for MUC-induced hematotoxicity. Other reactive metabolites and/or an interaction of reactive intermediates may also be involved in DNAPC induced by benzene.","['Schoenfeld, H A', 'Witz, G']","['Schoenfeld HA', 'Witz G']","['Joint Graduate Program in Toxicology, Rutgers University/UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['ESO2558/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ESO5022/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ESO7148/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Optimal treatment should minimize infectious complications and preserve the child's growth. We report a case of cutaneous GVHD in a two year-old boy, who presented an eczema-like eruption and responded well to broad band UV-B therapy. CASE REPORT: A two year-old boy with acute myeloblastic leukemia had a heterologous bone marrow transplantation with a graft issued from an unrelated female donor. Three month later, he developed eczema-like lesions of the trunk, arms and legs associated with diffuse alopecia, despite oral corticosteroids and cyclosporine treatment. Histologic findings were consistent with GVHD. Topical corticosteroids and broad band UV-B therapy were initiated, while oral corticosteroids and cyclosporine doses were tappered off. GVHD lesions cleared, allowing withdrawal of oral corticosteroids and cyclosporine 3 and 12 months respectively after initiation of UV-B therapy. No relapse occurred 24 months after systemic treatment discontinuation and 12 months after broad band UV-B therapy was stopped. CONCLUSION: This observation suggests that broad band UV-B therapy is an effective treatment for eczema-like, cutaneous GVHD.","['Tanasescu, S', 'Balguerie, X', 'Thomine, E', 'Boullie, M C', 'Vannier, J P', 'Tron, P', 'Joly, P', 'Lauret, P']","['Tanasescu S', 'Balguerie X', 'Thomine E', 'Boullie MC', 'Vannier JP', 'Tron P', 'Joly P', 'Lauret P']","['Clinique Dermatologique, CHU de Rouen.']",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Eczema/diagnosis/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Scalp/pathology', '*Ultraviolet Therapy']",1999/03/30 00:00,1999/03/30 00:01,['1999/03/30 00:00'],"['1999/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AD-01-1999-126-1-0151-9638-101019-ART16 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1999 Jan;126(1):51-3.,,,,,,GVH cutanee eczematiforme traitee par UV-B therapie chez un enfant de deux ans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on a 29-year-old man with an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma presenting with an unusual leukemia-like picture. On admission, the patient suffered from diffuse bone pain and renal insufficiency. Peripheral blood analysis showed anaemia, thrombocythaemia and blast-like cells. A bone marrow aspirate revealed extensive infiltration by atypical blast-like cells which were interpreted as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although confirmation of this diagnosis by immunophenotyping did not succeed chemotherapy was started immediately and led to partial remission. Histologic analysis of a bone marrow biopsy from the iliac crest, however, revealed an extensive solid tumor with alveolar spaces, lined by primitive round cells with positive PAS-reaction in the cytoplasm. Immunostaining demonstrated a positive reaction of the tumor cells for desmin and in a few tumor cells for smooth-muscle-actin. Chromosomal analysis showed a t(2;13) translocation typical for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Although multiple lytic lesions of the skeletal system became evident during the further clinical course, the site of origin of the primary tumor could not be defined retrospectively. In conclusion, rhabdomyosarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of systemic diseases with extensive bone marrow infiltration by tumor cells that could otherwise be misinterpreted as a haematologic malignancy.","['Reinecke, P', 'Gerharz, C D', 'Thiele, K P', 'Janig, U', 'Gabbert, H E']","['Reinecke P', 'Gerharz CD', 'Thiele KP', 'Janig U', 'Gabbert HE']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol,Verhandlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Pathologie,7503704,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/03/30 00:00,1999/03/30 00:01,['1999/03/30 00:00'],"['1999/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol. 1998;82:336-9.,,,,,,Alveolares Rhabdomyosarkom unter dem Bild einer akuten Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe the identification, sequence, chromosomal localization, and expression of the human cognate, hDMP1. The hDMP1 cDNA contains a 2280bp open reading frame that shares a high degree of identity with the mDmp1 coding region. The 4.4kb hDMP1 messenger RNA is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, with highest levels in testis and substructures within the brain. By use of fluorescence in situ hybridization with a human genomic P1 probe, we assigned hDMP1 to chromosome 7, band q21. This chromosomal region is frequently deleted as part of the 7q-minus and monosomy 7 abnormalities of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We analyzed hDMP1 copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization in leukemic blasts from nine patients with abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 7, and in each case one allele of the hDMP1 gene was deleted. Functional analysis of the mDmp1 protein has shown that it negatively regulates cell proliferation, which suggests that this gene is a candidate suppressor of malignant transformation. Further study will be needed to determine whether gene-specific mutations implicate hDMP1 as a tumor suppressor in acute leukemias with deletions of the long arm of chromosome 7 or in other types of human malignancy.","['Bodner, S M', 'Naeve, C W', 'Rakestraw, K M', 'Jones, B G', 'Valentine, V A', 'Valentine, M B', 'Luthardt, F W', 'Willman, C L', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Downing, J R', 'Roussel, M F', 'Sherr, C J', 'Look, A T']","['Bodner SM', 'Naeve CW', 'Rakestraw KM', 'Jones BG', 'Valentine VA', 'Valentine MB', 'Luthardt FW', 'Willman CL', 'Raimondi SC', 'Downing JR', 'Roussel MF', 'Sherr CJ', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DMTF1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/30 00:00,1999/03/30 00:01,['1999/03/30 00:00'],"['1999/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(98)00591-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00591-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1999 Mar 18;229(1-2):223-8. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00591-5.,,,,,['GENBANK/AF084530'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In liver, progenitors progressively decrease to undetectable levels by day 175.

A number of chimeric ecotropic MuLV envelope (Env) proteins were constructed that contained anti-CD34 single-chain antibody variable fragments (scFvs). The scFv-Env proteins were generated either by replacing the receptor-binding domain of Env with the scFv or by inserting the scFv into the N terminus of the Env protein. Only chimeric Env proteins with scFv insertions between amino acids 6 and 7 were incorporated into viral particles, and coexpression of native MuLV Env did not rescue incorporation-defective proteins. In addition, the efficiency of incorporation varied with the specific anti-CD34 scFv that was used. Retroviral vectors containing the scFv-Env proteins bound to CD34+ cells and transduced NIH 3T3 cells expressing human CD34 (3T3-CD34 cells) at approximately twice the efficiency of the parental NIH 3T3 cells. However, the introduction of the mutation D84K, which prevents binding to the ecotropic MuLV receptor mcat-1, prevented transduction of both NIH 3T3 and 3T3-CD34 cells. Complementation cell-cell fusion assays [Zhao et al. (1997). J. Virol. 71, 6967-6972] in 3T3-CD34 cells revealed that although the scFv-Env proteins could contribute postbinding entry functions when bound to mcat-1, they were unable to do so when bound to CD34. Taken together, these data suggest that although the interaction with CD34 effectively increased the concentration of virus on 3T3-CD34 cells, entry could occur only through an interaction with mcat-1; CD34 alone was not capable of triggering the appropriate postbinding changes that lead to viral entry.","['Benedict, C A', 'Tun, R Y', 'Rubinstein, D B', 'Guillaume, T', 'Cannon, P M', 'Anderson, W F']","['Benedict CA', 'Tun RY', 'Rubinstein DB', 'Guillaume T', 'Cannon PM', 'Anderson WF']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],['CA59318-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/*genetics/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1999/03/27 00:00,1999/03/27 00:01,['1999/03/27 00:00'],"['1999/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430349950018625 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Mar 1;10(4):545-57. doi: 10.1089/10430349950018625.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the in vitro synergism of fludarabine with anthracyclines and on results showing a higher efficacy of CHOP against COP we attempted to improve treatment results with a combination of fludarabine and an anthracycline. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of the multicenter study was to evaluate the rate and duration of remissions and investigate the toxic and immunosuppressive effects of fludarabine and epirubicin in the treatment of CLL in Binet stages B and C as first-line therapy or in first relapse. Thirty-eight patients were treated with fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on days 1-5 and epirubicin 25 mg/m2 on days 4 and 5. RESULTS: The overall response rate (OR) was 82% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 66%-92%) with a CR rate of 32% (95% CI: 18%-49%). For the 25 previously untreated patients the OR was 92% (95% CI: 74%-99%) including 40% CRs (95% CI: 21%-61%). Granulocytopenia grade 3 occurred in 23% of all evaluable cycles, and grade 4 in 17%. The median remission duration was 19 months (range 6-37 months). CONCLUSION: The results show that the combination of fludarabine and epirubicin is tolerable and highly effective in the treatment of CLL. With the addition of epirubicin to fludarabine, it appears possible to achieve a higher response rate and a more rapid response, especially of nodal manifestations. This regimen can be administered in an outpatient facility except for the first cycle because of the risk of a tumour lysis. The possible benefit of the combination presented here in the treatment of CLL in comparison to single-agent fludarabine treatment is presently under study in a prospective randomized multicenter study.","['Rummel, M J', 'Kafer, G', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Jager, E', 'Reinhardt, U', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Bergmann, L']","['Rummel MJ', 'Kafer G', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Jager E', 'Reinhardt U', 'Mitrou PS', 'Hoelzer D', 'Bergmann L']","['Med.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (E1490).,177-82,"PURPOSE: Considerable morbidity and mortality and costs occur during induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) can shorten neutropenia, and may lower costs. We performed a cost-minimization analysis of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for AML patients > 55 to 70 years of age during an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data were from a randomized double-blind phase III trial of 117 AML patients. Estimates of costs were from financial accounts from seven participating institutions. Costs were reported from the third party payor perspective. Analyses were conducted utilizing a decision analytic model. The primary source of event probabilities was in-hospital care with or without an active infection. Sensitivity analyses were also reported. RESULTS: When compared to AML patients who received placebo. GM-CSF patients had fewer grade 4-5 infections (9.6% versus 36.2%, P = 0.002) and grade 3-5 infections (52% versus 70%. P = 0.07) and $2.310 in savings. Sensitivity analyses indicated that similar cost estimates applied over a range of clinical and economic assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis can serve as a template for cooperative group cost analyses. Cooperation on study methodologies may allow for results that are relevant to both clinicians and policy makers.","['Bennett, C L', 'Stinson, T J', 'Tallman, M S', 'Stadtmauer, E A', 'Marsh, R W', 'Friedenberg, W', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Kaminer, L', 'Golub, R M', 'Rowe, J M']","['Bennett CL', 'Stinson TJ', 'Tallman MS', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Marsh RW', 'Friedenberg W', 'Lazarus HM', 'Kaminer L', 'Golub RM', 'Rowe JM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Institute for Health Services Research and Policy Studies, Northwestern University Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Middle Aged']",1999/03/27 00:00,1999/03/27 00:01,['1999/03/27 00:00'],"['1999/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008318930947 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)57078-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999 Feb;10(2):177-82. doi: 10.1023/a:1008318930947.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to improve survival, we have used a more intensive treatment protocol, MCP841, and examined prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred thirty previously untreated patients < 25 years of age with ALL were entered on study at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. Treatment consisted of three successive induction cycles, consolidation and six maintenance cycles. CNS prophylactic therapy consisted of cranial irradiation (2000 cGy) for patients above two years and high-dose cytarabine for patients less than two years. The total treatment duration was two years. RESULTS: Most patients had hepatosplenomegaly (80%) and or lymphadenopathy (79%) and 21% were of T-cell immunophenotype, but very few (1.3%) had CNS disease. CR was achieved in 484 (91.3%) patients and 145 (29.9%) patients relapsed. There were 36 induction deaths and 49 remission deaths, but the toxic death rate was significantly lower after 1990. In patients treated since 1990, three risk groups could be discerned: 1) WBC < 60,000 per mm3 and no lymphadenopathy (77% event-free survival (EFS) at five years): 2) WBC < 60,000 per mm3 with lymphadenopathy (53% EFS) or, WBC > 60,000 per mm3 and Hb 6 gm/dl or above (48% EFS): and 3) WBC > 60,000 per mm3 and Hb below 6 gm dl (16% EFS). In a multivariate model, only WBC, Hb and lymphadenopathy were significantly associated with EFS (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The CR and EFS rates achieved represent a significant improvement over previous results at this institution. Bulky extramedullary disease was an important risk factor in this series, but age and WBC alone inadequately defined risk groups, suggesting that prognostic factors may vary in different world regions.","['Advani, S', 'Pai, S', 'Venzon, D', 'Adde, M', 'Kurkure, P K', 'Nair, C N', 'Sirohi, B', 'Banavali, S D', 'Hawaldar, R', 'Kolhatkar, B B', 'Vats, T', 'Magrath, I']","['Advani S', 'Pai S', 'Venzon D', 'Adde M', 'Kurkure PK', 'Nair CN', 'Sirohi B', 'Banavali SD', 'Hawaldar R', 'Kolhatkar BB', 'Vats T', 'Magrath I']","['Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1999/03/27 00:00,1999/03/27 00:01,['1999/03/27 00:00'],"['1999/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008366814109 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)57077-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999 Feb;10(2):167-76. doi: 10.1023/a:1008366814109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study population included 11 patients in the chronic phase of CML (6 in hematologic remission and 5 with active disease), 6 patients in the accelerated phase, and 4 in blastic phase of CML. Patients received three 5-day cycles administrated every other week. rIL-2 was given as intravenous bolus infusions of 8 x 10(6) IU/m2 three times a day during cycle 1 and twice a day during cycles 2 and 3. Response to rIL-2 was assessed on day 45. No hematologic response was achieved in the patients with evaluable disease. One patient in hematologic remission with rIL-2 achieved a major response (from 72% to 9% Ph+ metaphases), and two patients had some degree of reduction of Ph+ metaphases. Responses were short-lived (< 6 months), but two of these three patients achieved a new cytogenetic response with interferon given post-rIL-2. A significant immune activation was achieved with rIL-2 including a marked increase in CD3+/CD25+ cells, CD56+ cells, and in natural killer/lymphokine activated killer cell cytotoxic activity. These results confirm preclinical studies, which showed that IL-2 has antileukemic activity in CML.

There is, however, controversy about the role of fatty acids in cell proliferation kinetics, and it is still unknown whether cell proliferation can be regulated by fatty acid dietary intake in humans. Our objective was to investigate whether feasible changes in the human dietary food intake that induce significant changes in lipids, fatty acids and the oxidative state were able to influence proliferation kinetics of the leukaemia cell line HL-60. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy men and women were subjected to four consecutive dietary periods with increasing degree of unsaturation: saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs). Plasma lipids and oxidation parameters were controlled during each period. Serum from each subject in the four dietary periods was incubated for 3 days with the leukaemia cell line, HL-60 (250 x 10(3) cell mL-1), to study cell proliferation. RESULTS: In men, an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched diet showed a significant inhibition of DNA duplication with respect to a saturated-enriched diet, but the effect is not sufficient in blocking cell proliferation. However, as expected, the in vitro addition of fatty acids to HL-60 cells significantly halted proliferation. In addition, the HL-60 growth ratio was shown to be inversely correlated with plasma vitamin E (P = 0.0004) and oleic acid in phospholipids (P = 0.01) in plasma of the individuals in the dietary intervention study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that changes in serum fatty acid composition obtained with dietary changes, without extreme variations of the regular diets of a free-living population, cannot block HL-60 cell proliferation.","['Colome, C', 'Alonso, R', 'Mata, P', 'Badimon, L']","['Colome C', 'Alonso R', 'Mata P', 'Badimon L']","['Cardiovascular Research Centre, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dietary Fats/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/blood/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipids/blood', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipids/blood', 'Regression Analysis', 'Vitamin E/blood/*pharmacology']",1999/03/27 00:00,1999/03/27 00:01,['1999/03/27 00:00'],"['1999/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2362.1999.00428.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 1999 Feb;29(2):129-38. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2362.1999.00428.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the translation rate is an important determinant of cell proliferation, we have investigated translation initiation during human myeloid cell differentiation using the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line and the U-937 monoblastic cell line. A decrease in the translation rate is observed when the cells are induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway. The inhibition in protein synthesis correlates with specific regulation of two repressors of translation initiation, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Induction of HL-60 and U-937 cell differentiation into monocytes/macrophages by IFN-gamma or PMA results in a dephosphorylation and consequent activation of 4E-BP1. Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was also observed when U-937 cells were induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages following treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO. In contrast, treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid or DMSO, which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells, decreases 4E-BP1 amount without affecting its phosphorylation and strongly increases 4E-BP2 amount. Taken together, these data provide evidence for differential regulation of the translational machinery during human myeloid differentiation, specific to the monocytic/macrophage pathway or to the granulocytic pathway.","['Grolleau, A', 'Sonenberg, N', 'Wietzerbin, J', 'Beretta, L']","['Grolleau A', 'Sonenberg N', 'Wietzerbin J', 'Beretta L']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, U.365, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (EIF4EBP2 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Granulocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', '*Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells/cytology/metabolism']",1999/03/27 00:00,1999/03/27 00:01,['1999/03/27 00:00'],"['1999/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Mar 15;162(6):3491-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to dissect the contribution of gp130 and LIFRalpha individually, chimeric molecules consisting of the extracellular domain of the granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSF-R) and various mutant forms of the cytoplasmic domains of gp130 or LIFRalpha were expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells to test for suppression of differentiation, or in a factor-dependent plasma cytoma cell line to assess for induction of proliferation. Carboxyl-terminal domains downstream of the phosphatase (SHP2)-binding sites were dispensable for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and the transduction of proliferative signals. Moreover, carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants which lacked intact Box 3 homology domains showed decreased STAT3 activation, failed to induce Hck kinase activity and suppress ES cell differentiation. Moreover, STAT3 antisense oligonucleotides impaired LIF-dependent inhibition of differentiation. Substitution of the tyrosine residue within the Box 3 region of the GSCF-R abolished receptor-mediated suppression of differentiation without affecting the transduction of proliferative signals.

Although the long terminal repeat (LTR) of MLV allows for transgene expression in a wide range of cell type, its activity is often silenced in vivo. In reporter macrophages transduced with a MLV-based retroviral vector, activity of the LTR was transiently and reversibly suppressed following stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). When unstimulated reporter macrophages were co-cultured with LPS-stimulated, untransduced macrophages, the LTR activity was similarly depressed. Activity of the LTR in retrovirus-transduced, mesangial cells was also down-regulated when co-cultured with activated macrophages. This suppressive effect was reproduced by cross-feeding with culture media conditioned by activated macrophages. LPS-stimulated macrophages abundantly expressed cytokines including IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). When externally added, TNF-alpha and/or TGF-beta1, but not IL-1beta, depressed activity of the LTR in reporter macrophages and reporter mesangial cells. These results raise a possibility that expression of transgenes driven by the MLV-LTR may be silenced in vivo when the retrovirally-transduced cells are co-localized with activated macrophages.","['Kitamura, M']",['Kitamura M'],"['Department of Medicine, University College London Medical School, The Rayne Institute, 5 University Street, London, WC1E 6JJ, United Kingdom. m.kitamura@medicine.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', '*Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Glomerular Mesangium/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', '*Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/pharmacology', 'Transgenes/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/pharmacology']",1999/03/27 00:00,1999/03/27 00:01,['1999/03/27 00:00'],"['1999/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(99)90414-X [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1999.0414 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Apr 2;257(1):74-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0414.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,

These include cell differentiation, cell migration, and the induced nonresponsiveness of T-cells to stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR), a state known as anergy. CRKL is also the most prominent substrate of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein which causes human chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML). The modular composition of the Crk family adapters which largely consist of Src homology (SH2 and SH3) domains has prompted an intensive search for physiological and pathological upstream and downstream signalling partners which selectively bind to these adapters. Upstream proteins include various receptors and large multisite docking proteins, while several protein kinases and guanine nucleotide release proteins (GNRPs) have been suggested to function downstream of c-Crk and CRKL. Most Crk/CRKL SH2- and SH3-binding proteins contain several docking sites with considerable sequence similarity. Thus the binding requirements of Crk/CRKL SH2 and SH3 domains are now well defined, providing a basis for the design of small inhibitory molecules to block the function of these adapter proteins. The enzymatic cascades activated through Crk family adapters are only partially known, but stress kinases (SAPKs/JNKs) and the GTPase Rap1, as well as the B-Raf isoform of the Raf protein kinases, are affected in some systems. Several yet unidentified, highly selective Crk interacting proteins detectable in specific cell types remain to be studied. More detailed analyses of the enzymatic activities triggered through Crk-type adapters will also be crucial to fully define the signalling pathways controlled by this protein family.","['Feller, S M', 'Posern, G', 'Voss, J', 'Kardinal, C', 'Sakkab, D', 'Zheng, J', 'Knudsen, B S']","['Feller SM', 'Posern G', 'Voss J', 'Kardinal C', 'Sakkab D', 'Zheng J', 'Knudsen BS']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, MSZ-Institute for Medical Radiation and Cell Research, University Wurzberg, Germany. stephan.feller@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (BCAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-crk)', '0 (PXN protein, human)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chickens', 'Clonal Anergy/physiology', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/physiopathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Multigene Family', 'Oncogene Protein v-crk', 'Paxillin', 'Phosphoproteins/physiology', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', '*Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'src Homology Domains']",1999/03/26 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/26 03:03'],"['1999/03/26 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/26 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199812)177:4<535::AID-JCP5>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199812)177:4<535::AID-JCP5>3.0.CO;2-E [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1998 Dec;177(4):535-52. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199812)177:4<535::AID-JCP5>3.0.CO;2-E.,,229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional complicating factors can include an inability to infect target cells in vitro, or virus-induced lysis of infected target cells. One way to circumvent these problems is to use virus-mediated gene transfer to deliver individual viral genes to autologous primary target cells. Several primary bovine cell cultures were assessed as potential target cells for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assays by measuring their levels of class I MHC expression and susceptibilities to retroviral gene delivery. High levels in both class I MHC expression and susceptibility to gene delivery were seen in adherent cell cultures isolated from peripheral blood (PBAC). PBAC, which arose as an outgrowth of adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures, had morphology, protein expression patterns, and response to functional assays characteristic of high endothelial cells. Expression of viral vector-delivered genes in PBAC cells was confirmed with a recombinant retrovirus carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The use of vector-mediated delivery of viral genes to bovine high endothelial cells is a promising method for assessment of cell-mediated immunity in cattle.","['Earnest-DeYoung, J V', 'Thacker, E L', 'Vaughn, E M', 'Pinnow, C C', 'Carpenter, S']","['Earnest-DeYoung JV', 'Thacker EL', 'Vaughn EM', 'Pinnow CC', 'Carpenter S']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Preventive Medicine, Iowa State University, Ames 50011, USA.']",['eng'],['R01CA59125/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (acetyl-LDL)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/immunology/virology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*immunology/virology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0166-0934(98)00151-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(98)00151-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1999 Feb;77(2):139-51. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(98)00151-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the role of interactions between CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) in these infiltrating lymphocytes on B-cell differentiation and expression of Bcl-2 family proteins. Ten human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus-I (HTLV-I)-seronegative and eight HTLV-I-seropositive SS patients were examined in the present study. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression of CD3, CD20, PCA-1, CD40, CD40L, Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-x on T and B lymphocytes infiltrating labial salivary glands of SS patients. We also examined the expression of CD40 and CD40L on peripheral blood lymphocytes of the same patients by using flow cytometry. CD40L was not expressed on peripheral blood lymphocytes of SS patients. Peripheral blood B cells but not T cells expressed CD40. In contrast, >50% of mononuclear cells, including T and B cells infiltrating the glands, expressed CD40. In addition, a clear expression of CD40L in both infiltrating T cells and B cells, and that of PCA-1, was also demonstrated. Surprisingly, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x was colocalized with that of CD40 determined by mirror section technique. Bcl-x was also abundantly expressed on infiltrating mononuclear cells, but, Bax expression was relatively less than that of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x. The expression of the above molecules was not different between HTLV-I-seronegative and HTLV-I-seropositive SS patients. Our results indicate that CD40/CD40L pathways could be augmented in salivary glands of SS patients, inducing B-cell differentiation to PCA-1 + plasma cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also suggests that signaling through CD40 by means of CD40L increases the expression of Bcl-2 as well as Bcl-x in infiltrating lymphocytes, providing the resistance against apoptosis.

METHODS: The medical, military recruitment, conscription, and military service data of male Finnish childhood cancer survivors were collected from manually filed records. Inclusion criteria were: survivors born 1977 or earlier, treated for a malignancy between birth and age 15 years, and followed by a pediatrician until at least age 18 years. The documents of 207 survivors from the Pediatric Clinics of Finnish University Hospitals were examined, and 130 of these survivors were considered eligible for military service. Demographic factors, the predictors of fitness for military service, factors associated with service interruption, the attained level of military training, and the health status of conscripts during service were evaluated. Comparisons were made with the Finnish male population of the same age and with conscripts serving at the corresponding time. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of studied survivors were enlisted. Positive predictors of fitness for service were year of birth of 1973 or later (odds ratio [OR], 3.2), height at call-up age of 170-174.9 cm (OR, 3.6), and the man's own positive opinion of his fitness for service (OR, 62.3). Negative predictors were age at diagnosis > or = 11 years (OR, 0.5), central nervous system radiotherapy (OR, 0.3), limb defects (OR, 0.02), and the group of sequelae concerning neurologic, cardiopulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems, or secondary malignancies (OR, 0.3). Survivors interrupted their service more often (20%) (P < 0.001). Leukemia survivors were less likely to interrupt their service (7%) compared with other survivors (P = 0.04). Factors associated with service interruption were: diagnosis (P = 0.04), the man's own opinion of his fitness for service (P = 0.013), surgery (P = 0.003), and height (P = 0.049), weight (P = 0.019), and body mass index (P = 0.035) at the beginning of military service. The attained level of military training was equal to that of controls. The survivors visited the garrison physician less frequently in total (mean, 5.9 times) (P < 0.001), visited because of infections as much as controls, and were off duty more (mean, 11.9 days) (P = 0.012) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The current study found that childhood cancer survivors were less likely to meet the requirements set for military service in Finland. The causes of rejection usually were obvious, but approximately 30% were rejected merely on the basis of a former cancer diagnosis. However, enlisted survivors coped well with military service if their treatment sequelae were taken into consideration carefully at the time of enlistment. Vocational opportunities within the armed forces might be an appropriate career option even for survivors of childhood malignancies.","['Lahteenmaki, P M', 'Salmi, H A', 'Salmi, T T', 'Helenius, H', 'Makipernaa, A', 'Lanning, M', 'Perkkio, M', 'Siimes, M A']","['Lahteenmaki PM', 'Salmi HA', 'Salmi TT', 'Helenius H', 'Makipernaa A', 'Lanning M', 'Perkkio M', 'Siimes MA']","['University of Turku, Department of Pediatrics, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Physical Fitness', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",1999/03/26 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/26 03:03'],"['1999/03/26 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/26 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990201)85:3<732::AID-CNCR24>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990201)85:3<732::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Feb 1;85(3):732-40. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990201)85:3<732::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical outcome is compared with posttransplantation bone marrow relapses observed during the same period at the same institution. The literature on the clinical characteristics, currently available treatment, and outcome of posttransplantation myeloid sarcoma patients was reviewed. RESULTS: Excluding isolated skin and central nervous system recurrences, the frequency of extramedullary myeloid sarcoma encountered as a relapse pattern following allo-BMT was determined to be 3.7% among patients with acute or chronic leukemia of myeloid origin. The survival of patients who were managed with radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy was less than 4 months. A patient who underwent a second allo-BMT following local radiotherapy is alive and in complete remission more than 33 months after the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. The median survival of 17 patients with posttransplantation bone marrow relapse following allo-BMT was 2.2 months. When posttransplantation medullary recurrences are analyzed, patients with CML had a median survival of 12 months, with a significantly better 5-year survival rate than patients with AML (0 vs. 60%, P = 0.015; median survival, 12 months). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcomes of patients with recurrent isolated extramedullary myeloid sarcoma following allo-BMT are poor, as in any leukemic relapse, with the exception of patients with CML in this setting.","['Koc, Y', 'Miller, K B', 'Schenkein, D P', 'Daoust, P', 'Sprague, K', 'Berkman, E']","['Koc Y', 'Miller KB', 'Schenkein DP', 'Daoust P', 'Sprague K', 'Berkman E']","['Tufts University School of Medicine, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory/*pathology/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bone Neoplasms/secondary', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms/secondary', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/secondary', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sacrum', 'Skin/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/03/26 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/26 03:03'],"['1999/03/26 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/26 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990201)85:3<608::AID-CNCR11>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990201)85:3<608::aid-cncr11>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Feb 1;85(3):608-15. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990201)85:3<608::aid-cncr11>3.0.co;2-5.,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is however, limited experience in children. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, comparative multicenter trial using rhGM-CSF after allogeneic BMT in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The study comprised 24 patients with ALL who received rhGM-CSF and 22 patients with ALL who did not receive rhGM-CSF. There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics between the rhGM-CSF-treated and untreated groups. rhGM-CSF was given at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day infusion over 4 hours from day +1 until +28 or until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was > or = 1 x 10(9)/L. All patients received HLA-identical sibling marrow and cyclosporine alone for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. The number of cells infused was similar in both groups. A software program (Statview 4.0, Abacus Concept, Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The median of days to achieve ANC > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L was shorter in the rhGM-CSF-treated patients (14 days vs 18.5 days; p < 0.0001). Patients who received rhGM-CSF had a lower incidence of grade III-IV mucositis. The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients who received rhGM-CSF (31 days vs 45 days; p < 0.005). No differences in GvHD severity, relapse or survival were observed. At the dose and schedule used in the present study, rhGM-CSF was well-tolerated and no side effects were observed. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: rhGM-CSF at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day in children with ALL undergoing allogeneic BMT is well tolerated, accelerates neutrophil and platelet engraftment, reduces the intensity and severity of mucositis and permits a more rapid discharge from hospital.","['Madero, L', 'Diaz, M A', 'Ortega, J J', 'Olive, T', 'Martinez, A', 'Badell, I', 'Munoz, A', 'Gomez, P']","['Madero L', 'Diaz MA', 'Ortega JJ', 'Olive T', 'Martinez A', 'Badell I', 'Munoz A', 'Gomez P']","['Hospital Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Feb;84(2):133-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intensification therapy before transplantation does not prolong disease-free survival.,125-32,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical results of two consecutive therapeutic protocols including autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ABSCT) for patients with de novo acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1). DESIGN AND METHODS: Between November 1989 and January 1997, 50 patients with AML in CR1 underwent ABSCT using two consecutive protocols. In the first one (Group A, 25 patients) peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected after induction and consolidation chemotherapy courses, and ABSCT was performed immediately thereafter. In the subsequent 25 patients (Group B), PBSC were collected after consolidation alone, and a further chemotherapy course with intermediate dose cytarabine (Ara-C 1 g/m2/12 h x3 days) and mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2/d x3 days) was administered as early intensification. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) in every case. RESULTS: Hematopoietic engraftment was slightly quicker in Group B, with median times to reach 0.5 x 10(9) neutrophils/L and 20 x 10(9) platelets/L being 13 and 12 days in Group A and 12 and 11 days in Group B, respectively. There were three graft failures (8%) (2 in Group A and 1 in Group B) and three transplant-related deaths (8%) (2 in Group A and 1 in Group B). No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of relapse (64% at 4-years in Group A and 81% in Group B). Likewise, the actuarial 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) was not significantly different between the two groups (32% v 18%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that AML patients in CR1 receiving ABSCT have rapid engraftment with low mortality. However, autologous transplants with PBSC collected after consolidation chemotherapy were still associated with a high rate of relapse (RR). This RR was not apparently reduced by the administration of intermediate dose Ara-C before transplantation.","['de la Rubia, J', 'Sanz, G F', 'Martin, G', 'Martinez, J', 'Cervera, J', 'Solves, P', 'Jimenez, C', 'Arnao, M', 'Vicente, A', 'Jarque, I', 'Sempere, A', 'Sanz, M A']","['de la Rubia J', 'Sanz GF', 'Martin G', 'Martinez J', 'Cervera J', 'Solves P', 'Jimenez C', 'Arnao M', 'Vicente A', 'Jarque I', 'Sempere A', 'Sanz MA']","['Hematology Department, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Feb;84(2):125-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic investigations of large NHL series reported different recurring chromosomal alterations. Among these, aberrations of chromosome 1p seem to be associated with T-cell differentiation, the region most frequently involved in breakpoints being band 1p32-36. Deletions and translocations involving the same chromosomal region are frequently observed in T-ALL, in which one of the most common genetic changes is the breakage of the TAL1 gene, mapped to the 1p32 chromosomal region. The objective of this study was to assess the possibility of TAL1 involvement also in T-NHL. DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of 17 pediatric T-NHL patients was molecularly characterized by microsatellite markers analysis and by TAL1 gene microdeletions. RESULTS: TAL1 gene rearrangement was found in one case, while loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MI) was identified in another case. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall our findings indicate that, differently from T-ALL, neither TAL1 gene involvement nor LOH or MI at 1p32 appear particularly relevant in the oncogenic process of T-NHL transformation.","['Perotti, D', 'Pettenella, F', 'Luksch, R', 'Giardini, R', 'Gambirasio, F', 'Ferrari, D', 'Fossati-Bellani, F', 'Biondi, A']","['Perotti D', 'Pettenella F', 'Luksch R', 'Giardini R', 'Gambirasio F', 'Ferrari D', 'Fossati-Bellani F', 'Biondi A']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy. perotti@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Feb;84(2):110-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 2-CdA administration often results in severe neutropenia and lymphocytopenia both responsible for the infectious complications observed in these patients. We previously reported preliminary data regarding the effectiveness and toxicity of a modified protocol of 2-CdA administration (0.15 mg/kg 2 hours infusion once a week for 6 courses) in 25 HCL patients. This treatment schedule produced a similar overall response rate compared to standard 2-CdA regimen and appeared to be followed by a lower incidence of infectious episodes. In the present study we report response rate and toxicity of weekly 2CdA administration in a larger cohort of patients and with a longer follow-up. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a group of HCL patients with a pronounced decrease in neutrophils count (< 1 x 10(9)/L), we modified the standard protocol (0.1 mg/kg daily x 7 days c.i.) by administering 2-CdA at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg 2 hours infusion once a week for 6 courses. Thirty HCL patients, 24 males and 6 females with a median age of 56 years (range 37-76), entered into this protocol. Seventeen out of 30 patients were at diagnosis while the remaining 13 had been previously treated with alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) (7), or 2-CdA (4) or deoxycoformycin (DCF) (2). RESULTS: Overall, 22/30 (73%) patients achieved CR and 8 (27%) partial remission (PR) with a median duration of response at the time of writing of 35 months, ranging from 6 to 58 months. Five patients (1 CR and 4 PR) have so far progressed. The treatment was very well tolerated. Five out of 30 patients (16%) developed severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 10(9)/L) and only in two of them we did register an infectious complication which required treatment with systemic antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we confirm that weekly administration of 2-CdA at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg for 6 courses appears to be very effective in HCL inducing a high CR rate, similar to that observed with daily c.i. administration. CR durability and relapse/progression rates are also comparable to standard 2-CdA schedule. Moreover this new regimen seems to be safer in pancytopenic patients, markedly reducing life-threatening infectious complications.","['Lauria, F', 'Bocchia, M', 'Marotta, G', 'Raspadori, D', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Rondelli, D']","['Lauria F', 'Bocchia M', 'Marotta G', 'Raspadori D', 'Zinzani PL', 'Rondelli D']","['Department of Hematology, University of Siena, Italy. lauria@unisi.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Infection Control', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/*drug therapy', 'Lymphopenia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Jan;84(1):22-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study is based on a review of the results of routine BMBs taken from 93 essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients at the time of diagnosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: The common BMB histologic parameters and clinico-hematologic variables were considered for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Clinico-pathologic correlations were looked for univariately. Moreover, the diagnostic significance of the histologic findings was tested by means of cluster analysis. Overall survival and event-free survival were considered as prognostic endpoints. RESULTS: There were no correlations between the clinic and pathologic findings, and none of the histologic and clinical parameters was predictive of survival or the occurrence of major clinical events. Cluster analysis of the BMB findings revealed two distinct morphologic patterns: one was clearly myeloproliferative; the other had somewhat dysplastic features. The event-free and overall survival rates in the latter group were significantly worse (p = 0.0377 and p = 0.0162 respectively), with major ischemic events accounting for most of the difference in event-free survival. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results have no clearcut counterpart in the literature, but we feel that dysplastic BMB findings could be included in the definition of ET prognostic scores in order to allow therapeutic strategies to be adapted to the level of risk.","['Annaloro, C', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, G', 'Oriani, A', 'Pozzoli, E', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, D', 'Radaelli, F', 'Faccini, P']","['Annaloro C', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Oriani A', 'Pozzoli E', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers D', 'Radaelli F', 'Faccini P']","['Centro Trapianti di Midollo, Ospedale Maggiore I.R.C.C.S., Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Blast Crisis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Ischemia/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Thrombosis/etiology/mortality']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Jan;84(1):17-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach is to use co-culture but the presence of feeder cells and serum may confound analysis of paracrine or autocrine factors involving blastocyst implantation. An alternative approach is to produce a defined serum-free culture medium supplemented with growth factors. We have shown that the addition of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor increased blastocyst formation from 18.4-43.6% but none of these embryos developed beyond day 7 or hatched, suggesting that additional factors are required. Development to the blastocyst stage was significantly increased to 71.0% in the presence of 100 nM heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and 81.0% of these embryos went on to hatch. No difference in blastocyst quality between the control and HB-EGF-treated embryos was found. These experiments clearly demonstrate the potential of this system to generate blastocysts in vitro. Further investigation of the normality of these blastocysts must be carried out before they are used clinically, since it has been demonstrated in other species that apparent improvements in culture conditions may be detrimental to pregnancy outcome.","['Sargent, I L', 'Martin, K L', 'Barlow, D H']","['Sargent IL', 'Martin KL', 'Barlow DH']","['Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Culture Techniques', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*drug effects', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/13.suppl_4.239 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1998 Dec;13 Suppl 4:239-48. doi: 10.1093/humrep/13.suppl_4.239.,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunotherapy directed at the MM Id may stem the progression of this disease. We report here on the first 12 MM patients treated at our institution with high-dose therapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) followed by Id immunizations. MM patients received PBSCT to eradicate the majority of the disease. PBSCT produced a complete response in 2 patients, a partial response in 9 patients and stable disease in 1 patient. Three to 7 months after high-dose therapy, patients received a series of monthly immunizations that consisted of two intravenous infusions of Id-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DC) followed by five subcutaneous boosts of Id/keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) administered with adjuvant. Between 1 and 11 x 10(6) DC were obtained by leukapheresis in all patients even after PBSCT. The administration of Id-pulsed DC and Id/KLH vaccines were well tolerated with patients experiencing only minor and transient side effects. Two of 12 patients developed an Id-specific, cellular proliferative immune response and one of three patients studied developed a transient but Id-specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response. Eleven of the 12 patients generated strong KLH-specific cellular proliferative immune responses showing the patients' immunocompetence at the time of vaccination. The two patients who developed a cellular Id-specific immune response remain in complete remission. Of the 12 treated patients, 9 are currently alive after autologous transplantation with a minimum follow-up of 16 months, 2 patients died because of recurrent MM and 1 patient succumbed to acute leukemia. These studies show that patients make strong anti-KLH responses despite recent high-dose therapy and that DC-based Id vaccination is feasible after PBSCT and can induce Id-specific T-cell responses. Further vaccine development is necessary to increase the proportion of patients that make Id-specific immune responses. The clinical benefits of Id vaccination in MM remain to be determined.","['Reichardt, V L', 'Okada, C Y', 'Liso, A', 'Benike, C J', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, K E', 'Engleman, E G', 'Blume, K G', 'Levy, R']","['Reichardt VL', 'Okada CY', 'Liso A', 'Benike CJ', 'Stockerl-Goldstein KE', 'Engleman EG', 'Blume KG', 'Levy R']","['Division of Oncology, Stanford Blood Center, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)', 'FV4Y0JO2CX (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COP protocol 2', 'VAD protocol', 'VMCP protocol']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemocyanins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Active', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Vaccination', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)49001-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2411-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that at pharmacological concentrations (1 to 3 mmol/L) sodium salicylate (Na-Sal) can potently induce programmed cell death in several human myeloid leukemia cell lines, including TF-1, U937, CMK-1, HL-60, and Mo7e. TF-1 cells undergo rapid apoptosis on treatment with Na-Sal, as indicated by increased annexin V binding capacity, cpp-32 (caspase-3) activation, and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and gelsolin. In addition, the expression of MCL-1, an antiapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, is downregulated during Na-Sal-induced cell death, whereas the expression of BCL-2, BAX, and BCL-XL is unchanged. Z-VAD, a potent caspase inhibitor, prevents the cleavage of PARP and gelsolin and rescues cells from Na-Sal-induced apoptosis. In addition, we show that Na-Sal accelerates growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis and synergizes with daunorubicin to induce apoptosis in TF-1 cells. Thus, our data provide a potential mechanism for the chemopreventive activity of NSAIA and suggest that salicylates may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of human leukemia.","['Klampfer, L', 'Cammenga, J', 'Wisniewski, H G', 'Nimer, S D']","['Klampfer L', 'Cammenga J', 'Wisniewski HG', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis and Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gelsolin/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sodium Salicylate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48998-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2386-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The p16(INK4A) (p16), which encodes for both p16(INK4A) and p19(ARF) proteins, and p15(INK4B) (p15) genes are inactivated by homozygous deletion and/or p15 promoter hypermethylation in a significant proportion of cases of childhood ALL at the time of initial diagnosis. To determine whether alterations in these genes play a role in disease progression, we analyzed a panel of 18 matched specimen pairs collected from children with ALL at the time of initial diagnosis and first bone marrow relapse for homozygous p16 and/or p15 deletions or p15 promoter hypermethylation. Four sample pairs contained homozygous p16 and p15 deletions at both diagnosis and relapse. Among the 14 pairs that were p16/p15 germline at diagnosis, three ALLs developed homozygous deletions of both p16 and p15, and two developed homozygous p16 deletions and retained p15 germline status at relapse. In two patients, p15 promoter hypermethylation developed in the interval between initial diagnosis and relapse. In total, homozygous p16 deletions were present in nine of 18 cases, homozygous p15 deletions in seven of 18 cases, and p15 promoter hypermethylation in two of eight cases at relapse. These findings indicate that loss of function of proteins encoded by p16 and/or p15 plays an important role in the biology of relapsed childhood ALL, and is associated with disease progression in a subset of cases.","['Maloney, K W', 'McGavran, L', 'Odom, L F', 'Hunger, S P']","['Maloney KW', 'McGavran L', 'Odom LF', 'Hunger SP']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, USA.']",['eng'],['CA46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/deficiency/physiology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', '*Mutagenesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recurrence', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48997-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2380-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Dami/HEL and Meg-01 cell proliferation in vitro was independent of and unresponsive to exogenous cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, thrombopoietin (TPO), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the growth of Mo7e cells was dependent on hematopoietic growth factors. When these cell lines were cultured in medium without cytokines, a constitutively activated STAT-like DNA-binding factor was detected in nuclear extracts from both Dami/HEL and Meg-01 cells. However, the STAT-like factor was not detectable in untreated Mo7e cells, but was activated transiently in Mo7e cells in response to cytokine treatments. The constitutively activated and cytokine-induced STAT-like DNA-binding factor in these three cell lines was identified as STAT5 by oligonucleotide competition gel mobility assays and by specific anti-STAT antibody gel supershift assays. Constitutive activation of JAK2 also was detected in the factor-independent cell lines, but not in Mo7e cells without cytokine exposure. Meg-01 cells express a p185 BCR/ABL oncogene, which may be responsible for the constitutive activation of STAT5. Dami/HEL cells do not express the BCR/ABL oncogene, but increased constitutive phosphorylation of Raf-1 oncoprotein was detected. In cytokine bioassays using growth factor-dependent Mo7e and TF-1 cells as targets, conditioned media from Dami/HEL and Meg-01 cells did not show stimulatory effects on cell proliferation. Our results indicate that the constitutive activation of JAK2/STAT5 correlates with the factor-independent growth of Dami/HEL and Meg-01 cells.

The viral protein Tax induces the activation and nuclear translocalization of transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is proposed to play a crucial role in the transformation of T cells by HTLV-I. However, the HTLV-I genes including Tax are not expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients. In this study, we examined the basis for NF-kappaB activation in freshly isolated leukemic cells from ATL patients. We found that leukemic cells from ATL patients, like HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, display constitutive NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and increased degradation of IkappaBalpha (an inhibitor of NF-kappaB). Whereas the NF-kappaB binding activity in Tax-expressing T-cell lines consisted mostly of p50/c-Rel, fresh ATL samples contained p50/p50 and p50/p65 heterodimers. One T-cell line derived from ATL leukemic cells, TL-Om1, displayed constitutive NF-kappaB activity, as well as enhanced degradation of IkappaBalpha, despite the lack of detectable Tax expression. Interestingly, the NF-kappaB in TL-Om1 consists of p50/p50 and p50/p65 like that in fresh primary leukemic cells. Our results suggest that activation of NF-kappaB occurs through a Tax-independent mechanism in leukemic cells of ATL patients, possibly due to differential NF-kappaB subunit activation.","['Mori, N', 'Fujii, M', 'Ikeda, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Ballard, D W', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Mori N', 'Fujii M', 'Ikeda S', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Ballard DW', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Research, Research Field of Pathogenesis and Clinical Sciences, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48995-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2360-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is believed that Bcl-2 family proteins exert their function on apoptosis only when they target to the mitochondrial outer membrane. The vinblastine-resistant T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell line CEM/VLB100 has increased sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced cytochrome c release, mitochondrial respiratory inhibition, and consequently apoptosis, compared with parental CEM cells. However, there was no difference between the two cell lines in the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-XS, Bad, and Bax at the whole cell level, as analyzed by Western blotting. Bcl-2 mainly located to mitochondria and light membrane as a membrane-bound protein, whereas Bcl-XL was located in both mitochondria and cytosol. Similar levels of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were present in the resting mitochondria of the two cell lines. Although the proapoptotic proteins Bcl-XS, Bad, and Bax were mainly located in the cytosol, CEM/VLB100 mitochondria expressed higher levels of these proapoptotic proteins. Subcellular redistribution of the Bcl-2 family proteins was detected in a cell-free system by both Western blotting and flow cytometry after exposure to TNF-alpha. The levels of Bcl-2 family proteins were not altered at the whole cell level by TNF-alpha. However, after exposure to TNF-alpha, Bax, Bad, and Bcl-XS translocated from the cytosol to the mitochondria of both cell lines. An increase in Bcl-2 levels was observed in CEM mitochondria, which showed resistance to TNF-alpha-induced cytochrome c release. By contrast, decreased mitochondrial Bcl-2 was observed in CEM/VLB100 cells, which released cytochrome c from the mitochondria and underwent apoptosis as detected by fluorescence microscopy. We conclude that mitochondrial levels of Bcl-2 family proteins may determine the sensitivity of leukemic cells to apoptosis and that, furthermore, these levels may change rapidly after exposure of cells to toxic stimuli.","['Jia, L', 'Macey, M G', 'Yin, Y', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Jia L', 'Macey MG', 'Yin Y', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mitochondria/chemistry/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Subcellular Fractions/*chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48994-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2353-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated mitochondria-dependent mechanisms of NO-induced apoptosis in Jurkat leukemic cells. NO donor glycerol trinitrate (at the concentration, which induces apoptotic cell death) caused (1) a significant decrease in the concentration of cardiolipin, a major mitochondrial lipid; (2) a downregulation in respiratory chain complex activities; (3) a release of the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c into the cytosol; and (4) an activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the number of cells with low mitochondrial transmembrane potential and with a high level of reactive oxygen species production. Higher resistance of the CD95-resistant Jurkat subclone (APO-R) cells to NO-mediated apoptosis correlated with the absence of cytochrome c release and with less alterations in other mitochondrial parameters. An inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, trolox, significantly suppressed NO-mediated apoptosis in APO-S Jurkat cells, whereas bongkrekic acid (BA), which blocks mitochondrial permeability transition, provided only a moderate antiapoptotic effect. Transfection of Jurkat cells with bcl-2 led to a complete block of apoptosis due to the prevention of changes in mitochondrial functions. We suggest that the mitochondrial damage (in particular, cardiolipin degradation and cytochrome c release) induced by NO in human leukemia cells plays a crucial role in the subsequent activation of caspase and apoptosis.","['Ushmorov, A', 'Ratter, F', 'Lehmann, V', 'Droge, W', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Umansky, V']","['Ushmorov A', 'Ratter F', 'Lehmann V', 'Droge W', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Umansky V']","['Division of Immunochemistry, Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G59M7S0WS3 (Nitroglycerin)', 'S18UL9710X (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cardiolipins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', '*Lipolysis', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Donors/pharmacology', 'Nitroglycerin/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48993-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2342-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the expression of the extracellular Ig-like domain of CD79b has been reported to be absent in the cells of most CLL cases, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that may account for this defect. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 50 patients and two cell lines (MEC1, MEC2) obtained from the PBL of one of them were studied. MEC1, MEC2, and 75% of CLL cases did not express detectable levels of the extracellular Ig-like domain of CD79b, which was nevertheless present in greater than 80% CD19(+) cells from normal donors. In healthy subjects the expression of CD79b was equally distributed in CD5(+) and CD5(-) B-cell subsets. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of CD79b RNA from all patients and from MEC1 and MEC2 cell lines consistently yielded two fragments of different size (709 bp and 397 bp). The 709-bp band corresponds to CD79b entire transcript; the 397-bp band corresponds to an alternatively spliced form lacking exon 3 that encodes the extracellular Ig-like domain. Both fragments were also visible in normal PBL. The expression of the 397-bp fragment was increased in normal activated B cells, while no difference was seen between CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells. To obtain a more accurate estimate of the relative proportions of the two spliced forms, a radioactive PCR was performed in 13 normal and 22 B-CLL samples and the results analyzed using a digital imager. The mean value of the CD79b to the CD79b internally deleted ratio was 0.64 +/- 0.20 SD in normal donors and 0.44 +/- 0.27 SD in B-CLL (P =.01). Direct sequencing of 397-bp RT-PCR products and of genomic DNA corresponding to exon 3 from MEC1, MEC2, their parental cells, and five fresh B-CLL samples did not show any causal mutation. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exon 3 performed in 18 additional B-CLL cases showed a single abnormal shift corresponding to a TGT --> TGC polymorphic change at amino acid 122. We propose a role for the alternative splicing of CD79b gene in causing the reduced expression of BCR on the surface of B-CLL cells. As normal B cells also present this variant, the mechanism of CD79b posttranscriptional regulation might reflect the activation stage of the normal B cell from which B-CLL derives.","['Alfarano, A', 'Indraccolo, S', 'Circosta, P', 'Minuzzo, S', 'Vallario, A', 'Zamarchi, R', 'Fregonese, A', 'Calderazzo, F', 'Faldella, A', 'Aragno, M', 'Camaschella, C', 'Amadori, A', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Alfarano A', 'Indraccolo S', 'Circosta P', 'Minuzzo S', 'Vallario A', 'Zamarchi R', 'Fregonese A', 'Calderazzo F', 'Faldella A', 'Aragno M', 'Camaschella C', 'Amadori A', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'CD79 Antigens', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis/chemistry/*deficiency', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48991-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2327-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms and strategies to overcome RA resistance by APL cells are still unclear. The biologic effects of RA are mediated by two distinct families of transcriptional factors: RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RXRs heterodimerize with 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] receptor (VDR), enabling their efficient transcriptional activation. The cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) has a vitamin D3-responsive element (VDRE) in its promoter, and 1,25(OH)2D3 enhances the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and induces differentiation of selected myeloid leukemic cell lines. We have recently established a novel APL cell line (UF-1) with features of RA resistance. 1,25(OH)2D3 can induce growth inhibition and G1 arrest of UF-1 cells, resulting in differentiation of these cells toward granulocytes. This 1, 25(OH)2D3-induced G1 arrest is enhanced by all-trans RA. Also, 1, 25(OH)2D3 (10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/L) in combination with RA markedly inhibits cellular proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Associated with these findings, the levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) mRNA and protein increased in these cells. Northern blot analysis showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) mRNA and protein increased in these cells. Northern blot analysis showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) transcripts were induced after 6 hours' exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 and then decreased to basal levels over 48 hours. Western blot experiments showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein levels increased and became detectable after 12 hours of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and induction of p27(KIP1) protein was much more gradual and sustained in UF-1 cells. Interestingly, the combination of 1, 25(OH)2D3 and RA markedly enhanced the levels of p27(KIP1) transcript and protein as compared with levels induced by 1, 25(OH)2D3 alone. In addition, exogenous p27(KIP1) expression can enhance the level of CD11b antigen in myeloid leukemic cells. In contrast, RA alone can induce G1 arrest of UF-1 cells; however, it did not result in an increase of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) transcript and protein expression in RA-resistant cells. Taken together, we conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces increased expression of cdk inhibitors, which mediates a G1 arrest, and this may be associated with differentiation of RA-resistant UF-1 cells toward mature granulocytes.","['Muto, A', 'Kizaki, M', 'Yamato, K', 'Kawai, Y', 'Kamata-Matsushita, M', 'Ueno, H', 'Ohguchi, M', 'Nishihara, T', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Muto A', 'Kizaki M', 'Yamato K', 'Kawai Y', 'Kamata-Matsushita M', 'Ueno H', 'Ohguchi M', 'Nishihara T', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Laboratories, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Multimerization', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/chemistry/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48979-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2225-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major problem is the quiescent nature of most HSCs, with the perceived requirement for ex vivo prestimulation in cytokines to induce stem cell cycling and allow stable gene integration. However, ex vivo culture may impair stem cell function, and could explain the disappointing clinical results in many current gene transfer trials. To address this possibility, we examined the ex vivo survival of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) repopulating cells (SRCs) over 3 days. After 1 day of culture, the SRC number and proliferation declined twofold, and was further reduced by day 3; self-renewal was only detectable in noncultured cells. To determine if the period of ex vivo culture could be shortened, we used a vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped retrovirus vector that was concentrated to high titer. The results showed that gene transfer rates were similar without or with 48 hours prestimulation. Thus, the use of high-titer VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus may minimize the loss of HSCs during culture, because efficient gene transfer can be obtained without the need for extended ex vivo culture.","['Rebel, V I', 'Tanaka, M', 'Lee, J S', 'Hartnett, S', 'Pulsipher, M', 'Nathan, D G', 'Mulligan, R C', 'Sieff, C A']","['Rebel VI', 'Tanaka M', 'Lee JS', 'Hartnett S', 'Pulsipher M', 'Nathan DG', 'Mulligan RC', 'Sieff CA']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['1 P50 HL54785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL55709/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48978-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2217-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To derive an optimal expression cassette, we systematically analyzed the sequence requirements and relative strengths of the Agamma- and beta-globin promoters, the activities of various erythroid-specific enhancers, and the importance of flanking and intronic sequences. Expression was analyzed by RNase protection after stable plasmid transfection of the murine erythroleukemia cell line, MEL585. Promoter truncation studies showed that the Agamma-globin promoter could be deleted to -159 without affecting expression, while deleting the beta-globin promoter to -127 actually increased expression compared with longer fragments. Expression from the optimal beta-globin gene promoter was consistently higher than that from the optimal Agamma-globin promoter, regardless of the enhancer used. Enhancers tested included a 2.5-kb composite of the beta-globin locus control region (termed a muLCR), a combination of the HS2 and HS3 core elements of the LCR, and the HS-40 core element of the alpha-globin locus. All three enhancers increased expression from the beta-globin gene to roughly the same extent, while the HS-40 element was notably less effective with the Agamma-globin gene. However, the HS-40 element was able to efficiently enhance expression of a Agamma-globin gene linked to the beta-globin promoter. Inclusion of extended 3' sequences from either the beta-globin or the Agamma-globin genes had no significant effect on expression. A 714-bp internal deletion of Agamma-globin intron 2 unexpectedly increased expression more than twofold. With the combination of a -127 beta-globin promoter, an Agamma-globin gene with the internal deletion of intron 2, and a single copy of the HS-40 enhancer, gamma-globin expression averaged 166% of murine alpha-globin mRNA per copy in six pools and 105% in nine clones. When placed in a retrovirus vector, this cassette was also expressed at high levels in MEL585 cells (averaging 75% of murine alpha-globin mRNA per copy) without reducing virus titers. However, recombined provirus or aberrant splicing was observed in 5 of 12 clones, indicating a significant degree of genetic instability. Taken together, these data demonstrate the development of an optimal expression cassette for gamma-globin capable of efficient expression in a retrovirus vector and form the basis for further refinement of vectors containing this cassette.","['Li, Q', 'Emery, D W', 'Fernandez, M', 'Han, H', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, G']","['Li Q', 'Emery DW', 'Fernandez M', 'Han H', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G']","['Department of Medicine, the Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],['HL 53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Anemia, Sickle Cell/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Synthetic', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Thalassemia/*therapy']",1999/03/26 00:00,1999/03/26 00:01,['1999/03/26 00:00'],"['1999/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48977-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2208-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies have shown that coinfection of macrophages with HCMV and HTLV-I significantly enhances HCMV replication, resulting in release of infectious HCMV from dually infected cells. We found that double infection of macrophages with HCMV and HTLV-I induced a rapid production of substantial amounts of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Results of transfection studies demonstrated that the tax gene product of HTLV-I was able to induce secretion of IL-8 and TGF-beta1. In addition to its cytokine-inducing effect, the Tax protein could interact with HCMV synergistically to result in production of much higher levels of IL-8 and TGF-beta1 than expected on the basis of their separate activities. Treatment of dually infected macrophage cultures with neutralizing antibodies to IL-8 and TGF-beta1 led to a nearly 1000-fold decrease in release of infectious HCMV from coinfected cells. Similar results were obtained when anti-IL-8 and anti-TGF-beta1 treatments were combined in macrophage cultures transfected with the tax gene before HCMV infection. Our results suggest that the stimulatory effect of HTLV-I Tax protein on HCMV replication in coinfected macrophages is largely mediated by high levels of IL-8 and TGF-beta1 production.","['Szabo, J', 'Bacsi, A', 'Beck, Z', 'Kiss, J', 'Andirko, I', 'Toth, F D']","['Szabo J', 'Bacsi A', 'Beck Z', 'Kiss J', 'Andirko I', 'Toth FD']","['Institute of Microbiology, University Medical School, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/*physiology', '*Virus Replication']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/107999099314351 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999 Feb;19(2):209-17. doi: 10.1089/107999099314351.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results show that high doses of IFN can be administered by the oromucosal route apparently without ill effect, raising the possibility that the oromucosal route will prove to be an effective means of administering high doses of IFN that are clinically effective but poorly tolerated.","['Tovey, M G', 'Maury, C']","['Tovey MG', 'Maury C']","['Laboratory of Viral Oncology, UPR 9045 CNRS, Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer/IFR Y1221, Villejuif, France. tovey@infobiogen.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/pathogenicity', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/pathogenicity']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/107999099314298 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999 Feb;19(2):145-55. doi: 10.1089/107999099314298.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, EoL-1, we investigated the effect of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which differentiates EoL-1 into monocyte/macrophage-like cells on Fas antigen (Fas)- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha)-induced apoptosis. Both TNF and anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (CH-11) induced apoptosis of EoL-1 cells. Pretreatment with IFN-gamma for 72 hours enhanced the CH-11-induced apoptosis with up-regulation of Fas. However, the treatment markedly inhibited the TNF-induced apoptosis. In flow cytometric analysis, EoL-1 expressed two types of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and the expression of TNFR2 but not of TNFR1 was up-regulated significantly after the IFN-gamma treatment. The TNF-induced apoptosis was mimicked by a TNFR1 stimulating antibody (htr-9), and was reversed by a TNFR1 blocking antibody (H398). Although the TNFR1-mediated cytotoxic signal was not affected by IFN-gamma pretreatment, blocking TNFR2 by a specific antagonistic antibody (utr-1) canceled the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma. In conclusion, TNF-induced apoptosis was mediated preferentially by TNFR1, and the anti-apoptotic effect of IFN-gamma was result from up-regulated TNFR2 in EoL-1 cell line. This cell line is a useful model to provide new insights into crosstalk among Fas/FasL-, TNF-, and IFN-gamma-mediated signaling.","['Horie, T', 'Dobashi, K', 'Iizuka, K', 'Yoshii, A', 'Shimizu, Y', 'Nakazawa, T', 'Mori, M']","['Horie T', 'Dobashi K', 'Iizuka K', 'Yoshii A', 'Shimizu Y', 'Nakazawa T', 'Mori M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Gunma University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/immunology/physiology']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(98)00058-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00058-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Mar;27(3):512-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00058-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma membrane expression of hsp70 increases selectively the sensitivity of tumor cells to lysis and, therefore, might play an important role in the antitumor immune response. Here, we demonstrate that a combined treatment consisting of sublethal heat (41.8 degrees C) and a noncytotoxic concentration of ET-18-OCH3 (25 micrograms/mL) results in a synergistic increase in the amount of cell membrane-bound hsp70 on leukemic K562 cells and on freshly isolated bone marrow of a chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) patient, but not on peripheral blood lymphocytes or CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells of healthy human individuals. Under these conditions the repopulating capacity of progenitor cells was not influenced. The increased hsp70 membrane expression on leukemic K562 cells results in a significantly increased sensitivity to lysis mediated by natural killer cells. In contrast to leukemic cells, the lysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes and CD34+ progenitor cells that lack expression of hsp70 on their plasma membrane was not negatively influenced by this treatment. A nonspecific disruption of the plasma membrane could be excluded, because treatment with a nontoxic concentration of the detergent Tween20 did not have an influence on hsp70 cell surface expression or on the sensitivity to lysis. Our findings might have further clinical implications with respect to purging of bone marrow from patients suffering from leukemia at sublethal conditions to induce a tumor-selective immune response.","['Botzler, C', 'Ellwart, J', 'Gunther, W', 'Eissner, G', 'Multhoff, G']","['Botzler C', 'Ellwart J', 'Gunther W', 'Eissner G', 'Multhoff G']","['GSF-Institute of Molecular Immunology, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(98)00055-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00055-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Mar;27(3):470-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00055-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-cell depletion (TCD) reduces the incidence of GVHD but increases the relapse rate after allogeneic BMT. We attempted to develop a regimen that would retain or increase the graft-versus-leukemia effect induced by donor T cells while preventing GVHD. Immunosuppressed mice were given immunocompetent donor cells, i.e., fresh lymphocytes or lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells differing from the host in major (MHC) or minor (MiHC) histocompatibility antigens. Engraftment of donor cells was documented by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Administration of MHC- and MiHC-incompatible allogeneic LAK cells, especially in conjunction with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), increased disease manifestations and mortality associated with GVHD. On the other hand, irradiated LAK cells or TCD-LAK cells prevented GVHD in both mice models studied. Phenotypic analysis of LAK cells demonstrated that CD8(+)-equivalent (Lyt-2) T cells are of significance in aggravation of GVHD. The in vitro cytotoxic capacity of LAK cells against MHC-nonrestricted target cells was not reduced by either irradiation or TCD. These results provide the background for designing improved protocols for immunotherapy of residual disease after BMT. In addition, the data imply that antitumor effects may be retained by irradiated rIL-2-activated allogeneic cells without causing GVHD. Whereas unmodified allogeneic LAK cells can induce more effective graft-versus-leukemia effects at the cost of GVHD, irradiated allogeneic donor LAK cells might play some role in eradication of minimal residual disease following autologous or allogeneic BMT without causing GVHD.","['Vourka-Karussis, U', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Pugatsch, T', 'Slavin, S']","['Vourka-Karussis U', 'Ackerstein A', 'Pugatsch T', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/radiation effects', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology/radiation effects/transplantation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(98)00026-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00026-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Mar;27(3):461-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(98)00026-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photosensitivity of target cells may be influenced by mitochondrial iron levels because ferrochelatase-catalyzed insertion of Fe2+ into PpIX converts it to heme, a nonsensitizer. To investigate this prospect, we exposed L1210 cells (approximately 10(6)/mL in 1% serum-containing medium) to a lipophilic iron chelate, ferric-8-hydroxyquinoline (Fe[HQ]2, 0.5 microM), prior to treating with ALA (0.2 mM, 4 h) and irradiating with broadband visible light. When Fe(HQ)2 was added to cells immediately or 1 h before ALA, the initial rate of photokilling, as measured by thiazolyl blue (mitochondrial dehydrogenase) assay, was markedly less than that of non-iron controls. The HPLC analysis of cell extracts indicated that ALA-induced PpIX was at least 50% lower after this Fe(HQ)2 treatment, presumably explaining the drop in photolethality. By contrast, cells treated with ALA and light 20 h after being exposed to Fe(HQ)2 contained the same amount of PpIX as non-iron controls and were photoinactivated at nearly the same rate. The 20 h delayed cells contained approximately 12 times more immunodetectable ferritin heavy subunit than controls or 1 h counterparts, which could account for the disappearance of iron's antisensitization effects in the former. Consistent with this idea, the short-term effects of Fe(HQ)2 on ALA-induced sensitization were found to be blunted significantly in ferritin-enriched cells. The Fe(HQ)2 produced strikingly different results when cells were sensitized with exogenous PpIX, stimulating photokilling after short-term contact but inhibiting it after long-term contact while having no significant effect on the level of cell-associated PpIX in either case. Thus, iron can have diverse effects on PpIX-mediated photokilling, depending on contact time with cells and whether the porphyrin is metabolically derived or applied as such.","['Lin, F', 'Geiger, P G', 'Korytowski, W', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Geiger PG', 'Korytowski W', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA.']",['eng'],['CA70823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (ferric 8-hydroxyquinoline)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Ferric Compounds/pharmacology', 'Hydroxyquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Porphyrins/metabolism', 'Protoporphyrins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1562/0031-8655(1999)069<0375:pispoa>2.3.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1999 Mar;69(3):375-81. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(1999)069<0375:pispoa>2.3.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds were chosen on the basis of heavy-atom-induced differences in triplet yield, phi T, and lifetime, tau T, and used as tools to test a model for phototoxicity based on photophysical parameters. All three porphyrins were found to localize preferentially in the plasma membrane of L1210 cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy. A poor correlation was observed between the measured photodynamic efficacies of these PS and a model using photophysical parameters determined by laser flash photolysis in homogeneous solution. However, an excellent correlation was obtained when the same parameters measured directly in the cells were used. The biological microenvironment of the porphyrins in cells induces significant changes in the photophysics of the PS. Reduction in fluorescence yield, phi F, and phi T observed for Br2-DP in cell suspensions arises from self association of the molecule due to increased hydrophobicity and high local concentrations. The photophysical model was also tested for its ability to handle variations in the oxygen dependence of cellular phototoxicity of these PS. The good correlation achieved between laser flash photolysis data determined in cells and the measured phototoxicity under air, 1.5% and 0.5% O2-saturated conditions, proves the intermediacy of singlet oxygen. This study gives further credence to the direct use of photophysical techniques to elucidate photochemical mechanisms in biological media while highlighting the potential pitfalls of using solution data to predict photosensitizing potential.","['Aveline, B M', 'Redmond, R W']","['Aveline BM', 'Redmond RW']","['Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Department of Dermatology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA68524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Deuteroporphyrins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Solutions)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Deuteroporphyrins/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Photochemistry', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Solutions']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1562/0031-8655(1999)069<0306:ccpbap>2.3.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1999 Mar;69(3):306-16. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(1999)069<0306:ccpbap>2.3.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just how the Ca2+ content of the stores is communicated to the activity of store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane is unclear. It has been suggested that, in some cell types, the link is accomplished by either a small or a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein, which is inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[gamma-S]) and, in some cases, pertussis toxin. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to directly measure the store-operated Ca2+ current ICRAC (Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ current) in RBL cells, we report that manipulations designed to interfere with GTP-binding protein activity (dialysis with GTP[gamma-S], exposure to pertussis toxin) routinely fail to affect the activation of ICRAC. However, these agents alter the activity of a K+ current in the same cells, demonstrating biological activity. Furthermore, activation of ICRAC does not seem to require the presence of a pre-existing diffusible messenger in the cytoplasm to any appreciable extent because the current reaches the same amplitude irrespective of the whole-cell dialysis time. We conclude that neither a mobile pre-existing molecule nor a GTP-dependent step is necessary for the activation of ICRAC in RBL-1 cells.","['Fierro, L', 'Parekh, A B']","['Fierro L', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '1KSV9V4Y4I (Cesium)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*physiology', 'Cesium/pharmacology', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:01,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s004240050816 [pii]', '10.1007/s004240050816 [doi]']",ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 1999 Mar;437(4):547-52. doi: 10.1007/s004240050816.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blastic transformation of this form of leukemia is extremely rare. To date, a single case has been reported. Methods and Results: A case of HCL, evolving with blastic transformation after a 9- year clinical course, is reported. Routine histology, cytochemistry, flow cytometry immunophenotyping, and Southern blot analysis for B- and T-cell gene rearrangements were used in the evaluation. Although morphology at the time of presentation was characteristic of HCL, the cells were initially tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) negative. During a clinical course over several years, the hairy cells became progressively TRAP positive. The morphology of the leukemic cells changed 9 years after initial diagnosis, with blastic transformation and retaining strong TRAP positivity. Immunophenotypic analysis showed evolution from a characteristic hairy cell leukemic phenotype to a phenotype indicative of marked immaturity. Genotypic analysis showed an evolving pattern of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, paralleling the morphology and phenotypic evolution and ruling out a second B-cell malignancy. Conclusions: This case report of blastic transformation in a patient with HCL is only the second such case identified in the medical literature to date.","['Friedline', 'Crisan', 'Chen']","['Friedline JA', 'Crisan D', 'Chen J']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,,,,1999/03/25 00:00,1999/03/25 00:00,['1999/03/25 00:00'],"['1999/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [medline]', '1999/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.154/MODI00300163 [doi]', '00300163 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 1998 Sep;3(3):163-169. doi: 10.154/MODI00300163.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it still remains unclear how aclarubicin (ACR) inhibits etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. We report here that the combination of ACR and VP-16 showed antagonistic cytotoxic effect in P388 murine leukemic cells. DNA unwinding assay showed that 1000 ng/ml ACR significantly reduced VP-16 induced early DNA double strand(ds) breaks compared to that of VP-16 alone at a concentration of 10 microM. However, ACR did not inhibit VP-16 induced early DNA double strand breaks at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, a clinically achievable concentration. Furthermore, DNA repair occurred within two hours after removing VP-16 even if ACR was co-cultured at concentrations of 100 and 1000 ng/ml. DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and detection of sub-G1 fraction by flowcytometer showed that 100 ng/ml of ACR inhibited VP-16 induced DNA ladder formation and formation of sub-G1 fraction. Radioactive precursor incorporation studies showed that VP-16 inhibited DNA synthesis rather than RNA synthesis. On the other hand, ACR selectively inhibited RNA synthesis at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. The VP-16 induced increment of [3H]-L-leucine uptake was canceled by addition of 100 ng/ml of ACR. These data suggest that ACR inhibited VP-16 induced apoptosis by the inhibition of RNA synthesis along with protein synthesis, but not early DNA double strand breaks and DNA repair at a concentration of 100 ng/ml in P388 murine leukemic cells.","['Nagata, T', 'Higashigawa, M', 'Shimono, Y', 'Cao, D C', 'Yan Mao, X', ""M'soka, T"", 'Inamochi, H', 'Hori, H', 'Kawasaki, H', 'Sakurai, M']","['Nagata T', 'Higashigawa M', 'Shimono Y', 'Cao DC', 'Yan Mao X', ""M'soka T"", 'Inamochi H', 'Hori H', 'Kawasaki H', 'Sakurai M']","['Dept. of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu-city, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/03/24 00:00,1999/03/24 00:01,['1999/03/24 00:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Dec;17(4):435-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of EBV reactivation (active infection or EBV infection with replicative cycle) was evaluated in a series of 30 patients with untreated Hodgkin's disease (except for one case with chronic lymphocytic leukemia) by quantitation of EBV DNA and titration of anti-ZEBRA antibodies in serum samples. DNA was detected in serum (>2.5 x 10(2) genomes/ml) in 15 of 30 patients and was more frequent in Hodgkin's disease with EBV-positive Reed-Sternberg cells (10/12) than in EBV-negative cases (5/18), (P< 0.01). Of interest was the demonstration that viremia correlated well with increased titers of anti-ZEBRA IgG and/or standard serological profiles of EBV reactivation (12/15), (P < 0.05). However the lack of EBV replicative cycle in Reed-Sternberg cells (negative for ZEBRA antigen and early antigen BHLF1) suggests that the viral replication occurs in a nonneoplastic cell compartment rather than in tumor cells. The measurement of EBV DNA loads and the titration of anti-ZEBRA antibodies shed new lights on the link between activation of EBV replication and Hodgkin's disease: these serological markers together with the determination of the EBV status of the tumor suggest that replication of the viral genome occurs with a decreased efficiency of the immune system, thus allowing progression of the tumor.","['Drouet, E', 'Brousset, P', 'Fares, F', 'Icart, J', 'Verniol, C', 'Meggetto, F', 'Schlaifer, D', 'Desmorat-Coat, H', 'Rigal-Huguet, F', 'Niveleau, A', 'Delsol, G']","['Drouet E', 'Brousset P', 'Fares F', 'Icart J', 'Verniol C', 'Meggetto F', 'Schlaifer D', 'Desmorat-Coat H', 'Rigal-Huguet F', 'Niveleau A', 'Delsol G']","['Laboratoire de Virologie et Immunologie, Universite Joseph Fourier, La Tronche, France. emmanuel.drouet@ujfgrenoble.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (BZLF1 protein, Herpesvirus 4, Human)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/virology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/immunology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Trans-Activators/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",1999/03/24 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/03/24 03:03'],"['1999/03/24 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/24 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9071(199904)57:4<383::AID-JMV10>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-9071(199904)57:4<383::aid-jmv10>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Virol. 1999 Apr;57(4):383-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-9071(199904)57:4<383::aid-jmv10>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible factors leading to infectious complications in these patients are suppressed immune defense mechanisms existing prior to therapy, including those involving the neutrophil granulocyte department. In this study we investigated whether neutrophil function as measured by oxidative burst and phagocytosis before the start of treatment correlates with the severity of infection after therapy. Forty-four patients were included, 27 men and 17 women. Their median age was 46 years (range 20-70 years). According to the development of infectious complications the patients were assigned retrospectively to group 1 (no or only mild infections, n = 29) or to group 2 (severe infection or death due to infection, n = 15). The phagocytic activity was significantly reduced in group 2 as compared with group 1 [113.7+/-13.7 (SEM) vs 170.0+/-19.2, mean channel fluorescence; p =0.04]. In contrast, the oxidative burst as measured by FMLP stimulation was pronounced but not significantly enhanced in group 2 (24.8+/-6.1 vs 14.5+/-3.4, mean channel fluorescence). In conclusion, patients with severe infections after chemotherapy might already have preactivated neutrophils with suppressed function prior to treatment. Thus, evaluating function parameters could help to estimate the individual risk of infection for a patient with ANLL.","['Hubel, K', 'Hegener, K', 'Schnell, R', 'Mansmann, G', 'Oberhauser, F', 'Staib, P', 'Diehl, V', 'Engert, A']","['Hubel K', 'Hegener K', 'Schnell R', 'Mansmann G', 'Oberhauser F', 'Staib P', 'Diehl V', 'Engert A']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin der Universitat zu Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infections/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Respiratory Burst', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",1999/03/24 00:00,1999/03/24 00:01,['1999/03/24 00:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050475 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Feb;78(2):73-7. doi: 10.1007/s002770050475.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While novel therapies such as treatment with interferon-alpha or bone marrow transplantation have successively improved the outcome of CML treatment, hope for future progress in the therapy of CML lies in an almost unique feature of this hematological malignancy. In contrast to many other forms or subforms of leukemias which display a great diversity in chromosomal alterations, most cases (>95%) of CML seem to be caused by an almost invariably found cytogenetic aberration, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), resulting in the bcr-abl fusion gene. Its gene product, p210bcr-abl (Bcr-Abl), is believed to be essential for hematopoietic cell transformation and seems to exert its effects by interfering with cellular signal transduction pathways, normally involved in the control of cell death and proliferation. Several partially interacting pathways have been shown to be induced by Bcr-Abl. The role of most of them is still unclear and, as understanding their biological functions should lead to novel therapeutic strategies on a molecular basis, much effort is spent on identifying their precise roles in CML. This review focuses on our current understanding of Bcr-Abl-induced signal transduction and outlines its importance for the biological effects of Bcr-Abl.","['Warmuth, M', 'Danhauser-Riedl, S', 'Hallek, M']","['Warmuth M', 'Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Hallek M']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, and Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit (GSF), Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, abl', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotides/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/physiology', '*Proteins', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/physiology', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'ras Proteins/physiology', 'src-Family Kinases/physiology']",1999/03/24 00:00,1999/03/24 00:01,['1999/03/24 00:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050473 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Feb;78(2):49-64. doi: 10.1007/s002770050473.,,186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The MFG vector was used for gene delivery of tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor (TNFalphaR) p55, viral interleukin-10 (IL-10), and murine IL-10 into RA synovial fibroblasts. The effect on invasion of these cells into human articular cartilage and on perichondrocytic cartilage degradation was examined after 60 days of coimplantation into the SCID mouse. RESULTS: TNFalphaR p55 gene transfer showed only a limited effect on inhibition of RA synovial fibroblast invasiveness and cartilage degradation. In contrast, invasion of the RA synovial fibroblasts into the coimplanted cartilage was strongly inhibited by both viral and murine IL-10. Perichondrocytic cartilage degradation was not affected by either form of IL-10. CONCLUSION: The data show that cytokines can be successfully inserted into the genome of human RA synovial fibroblasts using a retroviral vector delivery system, and that the SCID mouse model of human RA is a valuable tool for examining the effects of gene transfer. In addition, inhibition of more than one cytokine pathway may be required to inhibit both synovial- and chondrocyte-mediated cartilage destruction in RA.","['Muller-Ladner, U', 'Evans, C H', 'Franklin, B N', 'Roberts, C R', 'Gay, R E', 'Robbins, P D', 'Gay, S']","['Muller-Ladner U', 'Evans CH', 'Franklin BN', 'Roberts CR', 'Gay RE', 'Robbins PD', 'Gay S']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['DK-44935/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/pathology/*therapy', 'Cartilage/pathology', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibroblasts/physiology/transplantation', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Lac Operon', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1999/03/24 00:00,1999/03/24 00:01,['1999/03/24 00:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(199904)42:3<490::AID-ANR14>3.0.CO;2-L [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1999 Mar;42(3):490-7. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(199904)42:3<490::AID-ANR14>3.0.CO;2-L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four of five (80%) cases of PBCL, three of four (75%) cases of SMZL, and three of seven (43%) cases of HCL showed evidence of antigen selection, suggesting that these neoplasms involved clonal expansions of postgerminal center memory lymphocytes.

Toward the goal of achieving therapeutic expression levels, core elements of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HS) were screened for enhancer activity in erythroid MEL and K562 cell lines using a drug-resistant colony assay. When used alone, core elements of HS1, HS3, and HS4 showed no activity and a fragment for HS2 showed only modest activity in the colony assay. However, a 1.1 kb combination of fragments for HS2, HS3, and HS4 (termed a nLCR) enhanced colony formation 17-fold in K562 cells and 94-fold in MEL cells. Addition of an HS1 fragment enhanced nLCR activity only modestly in MEL cells. When linked to a beta-globin gene, the 1.1 kb nLCR enhanced globin mRNA expression to 82% per copy of mouse alpha-globin in transfected MEL cells. Inclusion of a nLCR in retrovirus vectors containing a beta-globin promoter and various A gamma-globin gene expression cassettes resulted in extreme genetic instability and reduced titers. Specific deletions were abrogated by removing homologous sequences, but random recombinations were still observed at significant frequencies. In MEL cells containing intact provirus, A gamma-globin mRNA produced by an optimal vector containing the nLCR was only 2-fold higher (8.5% vs. 3.9% per copy of mouse alpha-globin) compared to the same vector without the nLCR. These data suggest that vector elements detract from the ability of the nLCR to enhance expression of the beta pr.A gamma cassettes.","['Emery, D W', 'Chen, H', 'Li, Q', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, G']","['Emery DW', 'Chen H', 'Li Q', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G']","['University of Washington Department of Medicine, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],['HL 53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genes, Synthetic', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinopathies/therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Kanamycin Kinase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', '*Locus Control Region', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/10/29 00:00,1998/10/29 00:01,['1998/10/29 00:00'],"['1998/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(98)90200-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1998.0200 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1998 Sep;24(3):322-39. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1998.0200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of 5637 CM and NE with or without MTX, the mitotic index values were significantly improved in both groups. In group 2, the morphological index was significantly increased when using 5637 NE, and percentages of abnormal cells did not differ in 5637 NE and 5637 NE MTX compared to the control condition. Although cessation of interferon administration before sampling may improve the yield of the technique, it does not seem necessary when using 5637 CM and NE. The variability of the response of leukemic cells to different culture conditions further supports the recommendation that, in addition to the control condition, supplementations with 5637 CM and NE with or without cell synchronization be used in parallel in all CML patients.

A study of Fanconi anemia patients and review of the literature.,154-60,"Monosomy 7 is frequently found in the bone marrow of patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), marrow myelodysplasia, or acute myelogenous leukemia and is associated with poor prognosis. In our laboratory, cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow from an FA patient found 2 of 30 cells with monosomy 7, but the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that 83 of 207 cells (40%) had monosomy 7. FISH was then used to analyze two earlier samples from the index case, neither of which had monosomy 7 as determined by standard cytogenetics. The FISH analysis determined that the first sample, taken 19 months earlier, had 8 of 200 cells (4%) with monosomy 7 and the second sample. taken 7 months later, contained 43 of 200 cells (21.5%) with monosomy 7. These results indicate a slow evolution toward monosomy 7 in the patient's bone marrow. Standard metaphase chromosome analysis represents only spontaneously dividing cells, leading us to hypothesize that FISH was detecting monosomy 7 in nondividing cells and that it might be useful in the early detection of abnormal clones. To test this hypothesis, FISH was performed on 13 bone marrow samples from nine patients with FA who did not exhibit monosomy 7 by cytogenetic analysis. Monosomy 7 was detected in 3.44% of nuclei in FA patients and in 3% of nuclei in normal controls. To date, none of these nine FA patients have developed monosomy 7 or leukemia. They are being monitored by standard cytogenetics and by FISH to determine whether monosomy 7 develops and whether it can be detected by FISH prior to its detection by standard cytogenetics. As standard practice, we have adopted FISH analysis for monosomy 7 in all patients with FA.","['Thurston, V C', 'Ceperich, T M', 'Vance, G H', 'Heerema, N A']","['Thurston VC', 'Ceperich TM', 'Vance GH', 'Heerema NA']","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/03/24 00:00,1999/03/24 00:01,['1999/03/24 00:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898001678 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00167-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Mar;109(2):154-60. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00167-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we analyze the morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular findings of three cases of acute myeloid leukemia with trisomy 22 but without cytogenetic evidence of inv(16). The results indicate a consistent association between trisomy 22 and inv(16), the latter being cytogenetically cryptic in some cases. This finding is of potential diagnostic and therapeutic significance.","['Wong, K F', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Wong KF', 'Kwong YL']","[""Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Trisomy']",1999/03/24 00:00,1999/03/24 00:01,['1999/03/24 00:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898001459 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00145-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 Mar;109(2):131-3. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00145-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all 3 positive cell lines, protein expression was verified by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Although Flt3 is functional in these cell lines, as judged by ligand-dependent receptor autophosphorylation, it only mediates a proliferative response in 2 of the 3 cell lines. In conclusion, Flt3 is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic malignancies. Although early signalling events are detectable in all Flt3-positive cell lines tested, the expression of Flt3 does not predict a proliferative response of the cell lines.

The lymphoid cell line MOLT-4 was more susceptible to the agents than the myelogenous cell lines HL-60 and ML-1. In semicontinuous cultures in the presence of low-concentration PMEG the steady-state viable cell concentration was lower and the proportion of G1 phase cells was suppressed. Upon gradual removal of PMEG from the medium, the cell concentration and the DNA profile returned to values characteristic for the control culture.

The NC protein of murine leukemia viruses contains one NC Zn2+ finger and mutants that were competent in metal binding (CCCC and CCHH) packaged wild-type levels of full-length viral RNA but were not infectious. These studies were extended to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a virus with two NC Zn2+ fingers. Viruses with combinations of CCHC, CCCC, and CCHH Zn2+ fingers in each position of HIV-1 NC were characterized. Mutant particles contained the normal complement of processed viral proteins. Four mutants packaged roughly wild-type levels of genomic RNA, whereas the remaining mutants packaged reduced levels. Virions with mutated C-terminal position NC fingers were replication competent. One interesting mutant, containing a CCCC Zn2+ finger in the N-terminal position of NC, packaged wild-type levels of viral RNA and showed approximately 5% wild-type levels of infectivity when examined in CD4-expressing HeLa cells containing an HIV-1 LTR/beta-galactosidase construct. However, this particular mutant was replication defective in H9 cells; all other mutants were replication defective over the 8-week course of the assay. Two long terminal repeat viral DNA species could be detected in the CCCC mutant but not in any of the other replication-defective mutants. These studies show that the N-terminal Zn2+ finger position is more sensitive to alterations than the C-terminal position with respect to replication. Additionally, the retroviral (CCHC) NC Zn2+ finger is required for early infection processes. The evolutionary pressure to maintain CCHC NC Zn2+ fingers depends mainly on its function in infection processes, in addition to its function in genome packaging.","['Gorelick, R J', 'Gagliardi, T D', 'Bosche, W J', 'Wiltrout, T A', 'Coren, L V', 'Chabot, D J', 'Lifson, J D', 'Henderson, L E', 'Arthur, L O']","['Gorelick RJ', 'Gagliardi TD', 'Bosche WJ', 'Wiltrout TA', 'Coren LV', 'Chabot DJ', 'Lifson JD', 'Henderson LE', 'Arthur LO']","['SAIC Frederick, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, 21702-1201, USA.gorelick@avpaxp1.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nucleocapsid/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication', 'Zinc Fingers']",1999/03/24 00:00,1999/03/24 00:01,['1999/03/24 00:00'],"['1999/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(99)99629-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1999.9629 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Mar 30;256(1):92-104. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9629.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of glibenclamide and two synthetic sulphonylcyanoguanidine derivatives (dubbed BM-208 and BM-223) was examined on P-glycoprotein, the major ABC transporter responsible for multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. To this end, we employed different cell lines that do or do not express P-glycoprotein, as confirmed by Western blotting: first, a tumour cell line (VBL600) selected from a human T-cell line (CEM) derived from an acute leukaemia; second, an epithelial cell line derived from a rat colonic adenocarcinoma (CC531(mdr+)) and finally, a non tumour epithelial cell line derived from the proximal tubule of the opossum kidney (OK). Glibenclamide and the two related derivatives inhibited P-glycoprotein because firstly, they acutely increased [3H]colchicine accumulation in P-glycoprotein-expressing cell lines only; secondly BM-223 reversed the MDR phenomenon, quite similarly to verapamil, by enhancing the cytotoxicity of colchicine, taxol and vinblastine and thirdly, BM-208 and BM-223 blocked the photoaffinity-labelling of P-glycoprotein by [3H]azidopine. Furthermore, glibenclamide is itself a substrate for P-glycoprotein, since the cellular accumulation of [3H]glibenclamide was low and substantially increased by addition of P-glycoprotein substrates (e. g., vinblastine and cyclosporine) only in the P-glycoprotein-expressing cell lines. We conclude that glibenclamide and two sulphonylcyanoguanidine derivatives inhibit P-glycoprotein and that sulphonylurea drugs would appear to be general inhibitors of ABC transporters, suggesting an interaction with some conserved motif.","['Golstein, P E', 'Boom, A', 'van Geffel, J', 'Jacobs, P', 'Masereel, B', 'Beauwens, R']","['Golstein PE', 'Boom A', 'van Geffel J', 'Jacobs P', 'Masereel B', 'Beauwens R']","['Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Campus Erasmus, Bldg.

A single i.v. vinorelbine dose (26 mg/kg) was given to 279 mice at 7, 11, 19, or 23 hours after light onset (HALO). Bone marrow necrosis and leukopenia were nearly twice as large in the mice injected at 7 HALO as compared with those treated at 19 HALO (ANOVA: p <.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). The relevance of vinorelbine dosing time for antitumor efficacy was assessed in 672 P388 leukemia-bearing mice. Vinorelbine was injected as a single dose (20, 24, 26, or 30 mg/kg) or weekly (20, 24, 26, or 28 mg/kg/injection x 3) at one of six circadian times, 4 h apart. A significant correlation between single dose and median survival time was limited to vinorelbine administration at 19 or 23 HALO. An increase in the vinorelbine weekly dose shortened median survival time in the mice treated at 7 HALO (20 mg/kg: 29 days; 24 mg/kg: 17 days; and 26 mg/kg: 6 days) but significantly improved it in those treated at 19 HALO (20 mg/kg: 28.5 days; 24 mg/kg: 32 days; and 26 mg/kg: 36 days). The study demonstrates the circadian rhythm dependence of maximum tolerated dose and the need to deliver maximum tolerated dose at the least toxic time to achieve survival improvement through chronotherapy. This may be obtained with an evening administration of vinorelbine in cancer patients.","['Filipski, E', 'Amat, S', 'Lemaigre, G', 'Vincenti, M', 'Breillout, F', 'Levi, F A']","['Filipski E', 'Amat S', 'Lemaigre G', 'Vincenti M', 'Breillout F', 'Levi FA']","['Laboratoire ""Rythmes Biologiques et Chronotherapeutique,"" Institut du Cancer et d\'Immunogenetique, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/chemically induced', 'Intestines/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Vinorelbine']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1999 Apr;289(1):231-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis revealed that children who had received treatment for leukaemia exhibited significantly poorer performance on measures of the ""focus encode"" and ""focus execute"" elements of attention and on measures of the ability to respond to external cues and feedback. No significant differences in performance were found for measures of sustained attention and the ability to shift attention. These results indicate that children who have received treatment for leukaemia may experience highly specific attentional deficits that could have an impact on academic performance, particularly mathematical and reading skills. It is suggested that this underlying attentional deficit might be the source of the neuropsychological sequelae associated with the disease. Future attempts at remediation should incorporate activities specifically designed to ameliorate focusing difficulties.","['Rodgers, J', 'Horrocks, J', 'Britton, P G', 'Kernahan, J']","['Rodgers J', 'Horrocks J', 'Britton PG', 'Kernahan J']","[""Division of Psychology, St Peter's Campus, St Peter's Way, University of Sunderland, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, SR6 0DD, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Attention', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Processes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*psychology/radiotherapy', 'Psychometrics/methods', 'Survivors']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.80.4.318 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1999 Apr;80(4):318-23. doi: 10.1136/adc.80.4.318.,PMC1717894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival analysis and Poisson regression were used to estimate observed (crude) survival probabilities and the adjusted hazard of death. There was little evidence of a socioeconomic gradient in survival. Regional differences in survival were observed over time. These differences were most pronounced in the first six months after diagnosis, and may be attributable to differential access to centralised paediatric oncology services or treatment protocols, or to the artefact of variations in regional cancer registry practice. Similar analyses should be repeated for other, less treatable childhood cancers.

To explore the possibility of a polarized Th1/Th2 response we have studied CD30 antigen expression and the pattern of cytokine production by purified CLL T cells. Activated T cells from CLL patients showed a significant increase in the expression of CD30 compared to normal controls. Accordingly, high levels of soluble CD30 were detected in supernatants from activated T-cell cultures, as well as in CLL serum samples. Messenger RNA for IL4 was found in both resting and, to a greater extent, in activated CLL T lymphocytes. The latter cells were also capable of releasing IL4. Three-colour immunofluorescence analyses revealed a strong CD30 expression in the CD3+/CD8+/CD28- large granular lymphocyte subset, which is considerably expanded in CLL. Production of IL4, as well as expression and release of CD30 by these T cells, was conclusively demonstrated at the clonal level. These findings document an expansion of a peculiar subset of 'Th2-like' cells in CLL, with an increased IL4 production and CD30 expression and release, that are likely to contribute to both the B-cell accumulation and immune-defects characteristic of this disease.","['de Totero, D', 'Reato, G', 'Mauro, F', 'Cignetti, A', 'Ferrini, S', 'Guarini, A', 'Gobbi, M', 'Grossi, C E', 'Foa, R']","['de Totero D', 'Reato G', 'Mauro F', 'Cignetti A', 'Ferrini S', 'Guarini A', 'Gobbi M', 'Grossi CE', 'Foa R']","['Immunopharmacology Division, Advanced Biotechnology Centre, National Institute for Cancer Research, Genoa, Italy. gobbi@unige.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01219.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Mar;104(3):589-99. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01219.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now monitored the in vitro viability of B-CLL cells in relation to Bcl-2 and Bax expression over a 48 h time course following exposure to chlorambucil. The results showed that Bax up-regulation was essential for chlorambucil-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells and a 3-fold increase in expression within 4 h of exposure to drug was typically observed in sensitive cells; resistant cells failed to up-regulate Bax at all. In contrast, the constitutively high levels of Bcl-2 found in B-CLL cells were found to be down-regulated in apoptotic cells but the mean Bcl-2 expression in viable cells was increased, probably as a result of the loss of lower Bcl-2-expressing cells into the apoptotic compartment. Taken together, these data add further weight to the suggestion that Bcl-2/Bax ratios may be pivotal in determining the fate of B-CLL cells. Furthermore, the Bcl-2/Bax ratios found in apoptotic B lymphocytes were remarkably similar in the treated, untreated and normal control cells, which suggests that there is a universal Bcl-2/Bax ratio threshold for cell survival and cell death.","['Pepper, C', 'Thomas, A', 'Hoy, T', 'Bentley, P']","['Pepper C', 'Thomas A', 'Hoy T', 'Bentley P']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penarth, South Glamorgan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01210.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Mar;104(3):581-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01210.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In steady-state bone marrow, Ph-negative long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) and Ph-negative colony-forming-cells (CFC) were detected in 18/23 and 14/23 patients of group A versus 3/14 and 3/14 patients of group B (P<0.001 and P<0.02, respectively). The absolute number of mobilized Ph-negative progenitors was markedly higher in group A versus group B (P<0.02 for LTC-IC, P<0.003 for CFC). 12/16 newly diagnosed patients mobilized Ph-negative LTC-IC only and the yield was in the range of normal allogeneic donors. Overall the frequency of Ph-negative LTC-IC in the bone marrow predicted the yield of Ph-negative LTC-IC mobilized into peripheral blood (P<0.001). The bone marrow frequency of Ph-positive LTC-IC was considerably lower than the normal counterpart. Taken together, these findings suggest that normal progenitors are relatively well preserved in newly diagnosed CML patients, but tend to rapidly decline with time. This observation helps in the understanding of the pathogenesis of CML and has potential implications for autografting. The optimal time for a successful collection of Ph-negative circulating progenitors would appear to be soon after diagnosis.","['Frassoni, F', 'Podesta, M', 'Piaggio, G', 'Rosti, V', 'Pitto, A', 'Benvenuto, F', 'Figari, O', 'Vassallo, F', 'Carella, A M', 'Zikos, P', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Fugazza, G', 'Sessarego, M', 'Cazzola, M']","['Frassoni F', 'Podesta M', 'Piaggio G', 'Rosti V', 'Pitto A', 'Benvenuto F', 'Figari O', 'Vassallo F', 'Carella AM', 'Zikos P', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Fugazza G', 'Sessarego M', 'Cazzola M']","['Divisione Ematologia II, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01201.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Mar;104(3):538-45. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01201.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of IFN-alpha on the growth of myeloma cells, we have studied its effects on the response of interleukin 6 (IL-6)-dependent myeloma cell line (ANBL6) and IL-6-independent myeloma cell line (C2E3) in the presence of IL-6 and dexamethasone (Dex). We found that although IFN-alpha is a potent inhibitor of proliferation, it has only a minimal effect on induction of apoptosis. Moreover, we found IFN-alpha as well as IL-6 can significantly suppress dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. The suppression of apoptosis is concurrent with the induction of both AP-1 and STAT binding activity. We also found that IL-6 but not IFN-alpha up-regulates Bcl-X(L) expression. However, IL-6-mediated Bcl-X(L) expression is suppressed in the presence of Dex. Therefore, the expression of Bcl-X(L) does not account for the protection of Dex-induced apoptosis by IFN-alpha and IL-6. Taken together, our results suggest that IFN-alpha may counteract the beneficial effects of corticosteroids or perhaps other apoptosis inducing agents in the treatment of myeloma.","['Liu, P', 'Oken, M', 'Van Ness, B']","['Liu P', 'Oken M', 'Van Ness B']","['The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA-21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401334 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):473-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By conventional karyotype, we have identified unbalanced translocations involving 17p in 14 out of 123 (11%) CLL/SLL patients with clonal abnormalities. Cases were characterized by resistance to chemotherapy and a poor clinical outcome. The karyotypes presented a high incidence of complex rearrangements and 17p translocations were characterized by various partners. In 10 cases a centric fusion was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments using specific centromeric probes. The incidence of dicentric translocations in these series is therefore significantly higher than usually described, arising in up to 71% (10 out of 14 cases). In all cases, translocations led to a monosomy 17p and to a TP53 monoallelic deletion.

A deletion of CDKN2A would therefore disturb both pathways. To explore the p53 pathway genes as a functional unit in diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (DLCL), we wanted to see whether there exists mutually exclusiveness of aberrations of CDKN2A, MDM2 and p53, since this has not been analysed previously. We investigated 37 DLCL for aberrations of p15, p16, p19ARF, MDM2, and p53 at the epigenetic, genetic and/or protein levels. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was detected in seven (19%) of 37 tumours, and another three cases were hypermethylated at the 5' CpG island of p16. No point mutations were found in CDKN2B or CDKN2A. Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for p16 confirmed these results, as all tumours with alterations of CDKN2A were p16 immunonegative. We found p53 mutations in eight (22%) cases and MDM2 overexpression in 16 (43%) tumours. Twenty-three (62%) tumours had alterations of one or more p53 pathway components (p53, p19ARF and MDM2). Furthermore, 7/9 (78%) p16-immunonegative tumours showed co-aberration of p53 and/or MDM2. The lack of correlation between these aberrations suggests that DLCL acquire additional growth advantage by inactivating both of these critical regulatory pathways.","['Moller, M B', 'Ino, Y', 'Gerdes, A M', 'Skjodt, K', 'Louis, D N', 'Pedersen, N T']","['Moller MB', 'Ino Y', 'Gerdes AM', 'Skjodt K', 'Louis DN', 'Pedersen NT']","['Department of Pathology, Odense University, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401315 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):453-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401315.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, only very low levels of reconstitution were detected in human hematopoietic tissues injected with cultured mPB-CD34+ cells. Reconstitution was restricted to myeloid cells, and no B cell reconstitution in bone marrow, or T cell reconstitution in thymus was achieved by these cells. The loss of B cell reconstitution potential of mPB-CD34+ cells was shown to be induced in a time-dependent manner during culture.

In LC, BMP-9 concentrations of 100 ng or more per ml led to complete inhibition of Steel Factor (SF) + interleukin-11 (IL-11) or IL-12 supported CFU-C generation, which was partly abrogated when IL-3 was additionally included. We found this inhibitory effect of BMP-9 to be mediated by an increased TGF-beta1 elaboration and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in bone marrow cells with increasing BMP-9 concentrations. In the presence of neutralizing antibodies (Ab) against TGF-beta1, BMP-9 concentrations of 3 ng or higher synergized with IL-3, SF+IL-3, SF+IL-11/12, or IL-3+SF+IL-11/12 to increase CFU-C generation. Similarly, high BMP-9 concentrations dramatically inhibited primary colony formation induced by SF+IL-11/12, whereas in the presence of TGF-beta1 neutralizing Ab only 3 ng or more BMP-9 per ml stimulated both the time of colony appearance, the colony size and colony numbers in the presence of IL-3, M-CSF, GM-CSF, SF, SF+Flt3-L, SF+IL-3, SF+IL-11/12 or IL-3+SF+IL-11/12. BMP-9 neither stimulated CFU-C generation nor colony formation as a single factor, nor did it synergize with thrombopoietin (Tpo), erythropoietin (Epo), Flt3-L, IL-11, IL-12 or G-CSF. The effect of BMP-9 on its target cells was direct as demonstrated using single-sorted stem cells. These observations demonstrate that BMP-9 plays a dual role in regulating proliferation of primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells. Thus, in addition to its ability to enhance TGF-beta1 elaboration in bone marrow cells, it acts as a potent synergistic activity that is different from SF, Flt3-L, IL-11 or IL-12. BMP-9 mRNA was exclusively detected in the liver of adult mice, whilst no expression was found in stromal cell lines propagated from day-16 fetal liver or neonatal or adult bone marrow. 125I-BMP-9 bound specifically to a high percentage of blast cells in lineage-depleted post-fluorouracil bone marrow cells and to megakaryocytes in normal and post-fluorouracil bone marrow, indicating that BMP-9R are expressed on these cells.

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping has become a diagnostic tool for the analysis of normal and malignant leukocytes and it has proven to be a reliable approach for the investigation of minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukemia patients during and after treatment. In order to standardize the flow cytometric detection of MRD in acute leukemia, a BIOMED-1 Concerted Action was initiated with the participation of six laboratories in five different European countries. This European co-operative study included the immunophenotypic characterization and enumeration of different precursor and mature B cell subpopulations in normal bone marrow (BM). The phenotypic profiles in normal B cell differentiation may form a frame of reference for the identification of aberrant phenotypes of precursor-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (precursor-B-ALL) and may therefore be helpful in MRD detection. Thirty-eight normal BM samples were analyzed with five different pre-selected monoclonal antibody combinations: CD10/CD20/CD19, CD34/CD38/CD19, CD34/CD22/CD19, CD19/CD34/CD45 and TdT/CD10/CD19. Two CD19- immature subpopulations which coexpressed B cell-associated antigens were identified: CD34+/CD22+/CD19- and TdT+/CD10+/CD19-, which represented 0.11 +/- 0.09% and 0.04 +/- 0.05% of the total BM nucleated cells, respectively. These immunophenotypes may correspond to the earliest stages of B cell differentiation. In addition to these minor subpopulations, three major CD19+ B cell subpopulations were identified, representing three consecutive maturation stages; CD19dim/CD34+/TdT+/CD10bright/CD22dim/CD45dim /CD38bright/CD20- (subpopulation 1), CD19+/CD34-/TdT-/CD10+/CD22dim/CD45+/CD38bright/ CD20dim (subpopulation 2) and CD19+/CD34-/TdT-/CD10-/CD22bright/CD45bright/ CD38dim/CD20bright (subpopulation 3). The relative sizes of subpopulations 1 and 2 were found to be age related: at the age of 15 years, the phenotypic precursor-B cell profile in BM changed from the childhood 'immature' profile (large subpopulations 1 and 2/small subpopulation 3) to the adult 'mature' profile (small subpopulation 1 and 2/large subpopulation 3). When the immunophenotypically defined precursor-B cell subpopulations from normal BM samples are projected in fluorescence dot-plots, templates for the normal B cell differentiation pathways can be defined and so-called 'empty spaces' where no cell populations are located become evident.

Kill is mediated either by the CD95 or the perforin/granzyme pathway. We found that SH-EP neuroblastoma cells are preferentially killed via CD95, while in the T leukemia cell line CEM CD95 and perforin/granzyme are involved. In both types of cell lines, cells resistant to CD95- and drug-induced apoptosis are crossresistant to cytotoxic T cell kill. Resistant cells show decreased apoptosis and deficient activation of caspases indicated by decreased cleavage of the prototype caspase substrate PARP. Preincubation with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk strongly decreased LAK cell kill in sensitive cells. Although parental CEM cells could be sensitized for LAK kill by preincubation with doxorubicin, resistance could not be reverted in doxorubicin or CD95 resistant CEM cells.

Most childhood B-lineage ALL cells are constitutively resistant towards CD95-induced death. We report here that chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin, cytarabine, methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, sensitize CD95-resistant pre-B-ALL cell lines for CD95- and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-induced cell death. Enhanced susceptibility in drug-treated cells was found to be associated with increased expression of CD95 mRNA and surface expression of CD95 protein, as well as loss of Bcl-xL protein and disturbance of mitochondrial function. Low level activation of caspases and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase following CD95 triggering was strongly increased in drug pre-treated cells. Furthermore, drug pre-treated cells could be rescued from CD95-mediated apoptosis by blocking the CD95-signaling pathway with a FADD-dominant negative expression construct. Our data suggest that chemotherapeutic drugs may sensitize pre-B ALL cells by at least two mechanisms: (1) by increasing CD95 expression; and (2) by lowering the threshold for apoptotic signals. These findings may explain the effectiveness of low-dose chemotherapy and indicate an active role for key molecules of apoptosis and the immune system during chemotherapy of leukemia.","['Posovszky, C', 'Friesen, C', 'Herr, I', 'Debatin, K M']","['Posovszky C', 'Friesen C', 'Herr I', 'Debatin KM']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401327 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):400-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401327.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 expression levels in PB significantly correlated with the evolution of RAEB or RAEB-t to overt AML within 6 months. Therefore, WT1 expression levels in PB were superior to those in BM for early prediction of the evolution to AML by means of quantitation of the WT1 expression levels. Furthermore, WT1 expression in PB of patients with overt AML evolved from MDS was significantly decreased by effective chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation and became undetectable in long-term survivors. These results clearly showed that WT1 expression levels are a tumor marker for preleukemic or leukemic blast cells of MDS and thus reflect the disease progression of MDS. Therefore, monitoring of WT1 expression levels has made continuous assessment of the disease progression of MDS possible, as well as the prediction of the evolution of RAEB or RAEB-t to overt AML within 6 months.

CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/CD38+ subpopulations of seven patients in morphological complete remission were isolated by FACS (purity >98%) and were analyzed by conventional cytogenetics or FISH for chromosomal aberrations. In five of seven patients, clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in the CD34+/CD38+ subpopulation and in one patient with AML M2 (add (2)(q37)) in the most immature CD34+/CD38- stem cell compartment. One patient with AML M4Eo (inv(16),+8), showed a normal karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis, whereas four of 15 metaphases of the sorted CD34+/CD38+ subpopulation revealed the inversion 16. These observations underline that leukemic cells can survive intensive chemotherapy in the niche of the stem cell compartment. In some patients the sensitivity for the detection of persistent leukemic cells seems to be higher in FACS-sorted subpopulations than conventional cytogenetic analysis of the unseparated bone marrow.

The reverse was found in AML (3-year survival 13% in -7 alone vs 44% in other cytogenetic groups). Stable disease for several years was documented in more than half the patients with RA or RAEB. Patients with RA, RAEB or JMML treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) without prior chemotherapy had a 3-year survival of 73%. The morphologic diagnosis was the strongest prognostic factor.

MDS1/EVI1 is inappropriately activated in myeloid leukemias following chromosomal rearrangements involving band 3q26. The rearrangements lead either to gene truncation, and to expression of the transcription repressor EVI1, as seen in the t(3;3)(q21;q26) and inv(3)(q21q26), or to gene fusion, as seen in the t(3;21)(q26;q22) which results in the fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1. This fusion protein contains the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor AML1 fused in-frame to the entire MDS1/EVI1 with the exclusion of its first 12 amino acids. In this report, we have analyzed the response of the hematopoietic precursor cell line 32Dcl3, expressing either the normal protein MDS1/EVI1 or the fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1, to factors that control cell differentiation or cell replication. The 32Dcl3 cells are IL-3-dependent for growth and they differentiate into granulocytes when exposed to G-CSF. They are growth-inhibited by TGF-beta1. We show that whereas the expression of MDS1/EVI1 has no effect on granulocytic differentiation induced by G-CSF, expression of AML1/MDS1/EVI1 blocks differentiation resulting in cell death. This effect is similar to that previously described by others for 32Dcl3 cells that express transgenic Evil. Furthermore, we show that whereas the expression of the fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1 completely abrogates the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 and allows 32Dcl3 cells to proliferate, expression of the normal protein MDS1/EVI1 has the opposite effect, and it strengthens the response of cells to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we also show that EVI1 (contained in its entirety in MDS1/EVI1 and AML1/MDS1/EVI1) physically interacts with SMAD3, which is an intracellular mediator of TGF-beta1 signaling. Finally, we have correlated the response of the cells to G-CSF or TGF-beta1 with the ability of the normal and fusion proteins to activate or repress promoters which they can directly regulate by binding to the promoter site. We propose that mutations of MDS1/EVI1 either by gene truncation resulting in the transcription repressor EVI1 or by gene fusion to AML1 lead to an altered cellular response to growth and differentiation factors that could result in leukemic transformation. The different response of myeloid cells ectopically expressing the normal or the fusion protein to G-CSF and TGF-beta1 could depend on the different transactivation properties of these proteins resulting in divergent expression of downstream genes regulated by the two proteins.","['Sood, R', 'Talwar-Trikha, A', 'Chakrabarti, S R', 'Nucifora, G']","['Sood R', 'Talwar-Trikha A', 'Chakrabarti SR', 'Nucifora G']","['Oncology Institute, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401360 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):348-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a topotecan/topoisomerase II inhibitor sequential combination that may be active in acute leukemia, and to evaluate the effects of in vivo exposure to topotecan on topoisomerase II levels in leukemic blast cells as measured by image cytometry. Patients who were eligible for this phase I study had relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (< or = 2 prior regimens) or CML blast crisis (0 or 1 prior regimen). Topotecan was given as a 5 day continuous i.v. infusion and was to be escalated through three levels (1.5, 1.75 and 2.0 mg/m2 day), followed by etoposide at two dose levels (100 and 150 mg/m2) i.v. bolus days 6, 7 and 8. Topoisomerase IIalpha levels in leukemic blasts from bone marrow were measured by image cytometry prior to starting treatment, on day 5 of topotecan infusion and on day 28; and daily during topotecan in peripheral blood blasts. Dose-limiting toxicity was seen in two of six patients at the first dose level (topotecan 1.5 mg/m2/day, etoposide 100 mg/m2/day; > or = grade 3 mucositis in both cases). This cohort was expanded to 10 patients; no further non-hematologic dose-limiting toxicity was observed, but given the extent of toxicity seen, further dose escalation was judged not to be feasible. Topo IIalpha levels increased in peripheral blood blasts during the first 72 h of topotecan infusion and returned to near baseline by day 5, whereas levels appeared to decrease in bone marrow blasts by day 5 compared to pretreatment. One complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission in a patient with CML blast crisis was observed in the 10 patients evaluable for response. The sequential administration of topotecan 1.5 mg/m2/day continuous infusion for 5 days followed by etoposide 100 mg/m2/day x 3 is the recommended phase II dose for this schedule. Topotecan increases topo IIalpha expression in vivo in leukemia cells, but levels of the enzyme are cell cycle dependent. Pharmacodynamic evaluation of the sequential or combination administration of novel antileukemic agents may help improve treatment strategies in acute leukemia.","['Crump, M', 'Lipton, J', 'Hedley, D', 'Sutton, D', 'Shepherd, F', 'Minden, M', 'Stewart, K', 'Beare, S', 'Eisenhauer, E']","['Crump M', 'Lipton J', 'Hedley D', 'Sutton D', 'Shepherd F', 'Minden M', 'Stewart K', 'Beare S', 'Eisenhauer E']","['Department of Medicine, The Toronto Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401308 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):343-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401308.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five hundred and fifty-two patients (357 patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 195 patients with advanced stage lymphoblastic lymphoma) were enrolled in POG study 8704 (T-3). Treatment included rotating combinations of high-dose myelosuppressive chemotherapy agents proven to be effective in T cell ALL in other POG group-wide or local institutional protocols (including vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, asparaginase, teniposide, cytarabine and mercaptopurine). After achieving a complete remission (CR), patients were randomized to receive or not receive high-dose intensive asparaginase consolidation (25,000 IU/m2) given weekly for 20 weeks by intramuscular injection. Intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, hydrocortisone and cytarabine) was given to prevent CNS disease, and CNS irradiation was used only for patients with leukemia and an initial WBC of >50,000/microl or patients with active CNS disease at diagnosis. CR was achieved in 96% of patients. The high-dose asparaginase regimen was significantly superior to the control regimen for both the leukemia and lymphoma subgroups. Four-year continuous complete remission rate (CCR) for the leukemia patients was 68% (s.e. 4%) with asparaginase as compared to 55% (s.e. 4%) without. For the lymphoma patients, 4-year CCR was 78% (s.e. 5%) with asparaginase and 64% (s.e. 6%) in the controls. The overall one-sided logrank test had a P value <0.001 favoring asparaginase, while corresponding values were P = 0.002 for ALL and P = 0.048 lymphoblastic lymphoma. Toxicities were tolerable, but there were 18 failures due to secondary malignancies (16 with non-lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplasia). Neither WBC at diagnosis (leukemia patients) nor lymphoma stage were major prognostic factors. We conclude that when added to a backbone of effective rotating agents, repeated doses of asparaginase during early treatment improve the outcome for patients with T cell leukemia and advanced stage lymphoblastic lymphoma.","['Amylon, M D', 'Shuster, J', 'Pullen, J', 'Berard, C', 'Link, M P', 'Wharam, M', 'Katz, J', 'Yu, A', 'Laver, J', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Desai, S', 'Camitta, B', 'Murphy, S B']","['Amylon MD', 'Shuster J', 'Pullen J', 'Berard C', 'Link MP', 'Wharam M', 'Katz J', 'Yu A', 'Laver J', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Desai S', 'Camitta B', 'Murphy SB']","['Stanford University, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401310 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):335-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ample evidence has been provided that the IL-6/1L-6R complex may be responsible for the proliferation of normal and neoplastic megakaryocytes in vitro and this fact lead us to the hypothesis, that defects in the regulation of IL-6 synthesis take part in the pathogenesis of PV. The study was carried out to determine the IL-6 serum levels and the megakaryocytic IL-6 production in patients with PV and to compare these data with the situation in hematologically healthy donors as well as in patients suffering from spurious polycythemia--smokers polyglobuly (PG). For this purpose, IL-6 serum levels were measured by ELISA and the megakaryocytic production studied by immunohistochemistry, reverse hemolytic plaque assay (RHPA) together with reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in highly enriched megakaryocyte preparations. In additional experiments, the influence of IL-3 stimulation and the expression of IL-6R were tested. Serum levels of IL-6 did not differ between the three groups under study. In contrast, immunohistochemistry revealed a raised proportion of megakaryocytes expressing IL-6 in PV as compared to normal donors and patients suffering from PG. The percentage of megakaryocytes actively secreting this cytokine as detected by the RHPA was 20 times greater than in both the other groups. This phenomenon was further substantiated by the fact that IL-6 mRNA could only be shown in PV megakaryocyte preparations. The regulation of IL-6 secretion appears to be abnormal in PV. Whereas in the normal and in the PG group IL-3 stimulation exerts a marked increase in megakaryocytic IL-6 secretion, PV megakaryocytes responded with a paradoxical down-regulation of IL-6 synthesis combined with the loss of IL-6R. Our data describe for the first time an abnormally raised IL-6 production by PV megakaryocytes and point towards fundamental regulatory alterations of the IL-6 synthesis in this disease.","['Wickenhauser, C', 'Thiele, J', 'Lorenzen, J', 'Schmitz, B', 'Frimpong, S', 'Schramm, K', 'Neumann, I', 'Zankovich, R', 'Fischer, R']","['Wickenhauser C', 'Thiele J', 'Lorenzen J', 'Schmitz B', 'Frimpong S', 'Schramm K', 'Neumann I', 'Zankovich R', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Smoking/*metabolism']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401314 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):327-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401314.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genistein, abundant in soybeans, is reported to be a potent nonintercalative topo II inhibitor. It interferes with the break-reseal reaction of topo II by stabilizing a cleavable complex, which in the presence of detergents, results in DNA strand breaks. The present study revealed that genistein induced chromatid-type aberrations, in which chromatid exchanges are often observed. Genistein seems to act in a manner very similar to that of VP-16, although the latter is reported to produce both chromatid- and chromosome-type aberrations. In view of this pharmacological similarity between genistein and VP-16, and also the similarity of breakpoint clustering regions within the MLL gene in reported cases with secondary leukemia and IAL, genistein may be largely responsible for the development of IAL.","['Abe, T']",['Abe T'],,['eng'],,"['Editorial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age of Onset', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Genistein/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Soybeans/*chemistry']",1999/03/23 03:03,2000/06/10 09:00,['1999/03/23 03:03'],"['1999/03/23 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '1999/03/23 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401344 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Mar;13(3):317-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401344.,,,['Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):524-5.

Up to 90% of patients who achieved remission developed graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). However, any description of the clinical and histologic features in these cases is lacking. OBSERVATIONS: We describe 2 patients in whom a severe, peculiar, hyperacute, fatal GVHD developed after treatment with donor leukocyte infusions and interferon alfa. The patients had not received any additional chemotherapy or GVHD prophylaxis. In both patients, the eruption started with the appearance of erythematous plaques at the interferon alfa injection sites, and a generalized maculopapular eruption subsequently developed. The clinical lesions evolved from acute to lichenoid within several days. The histologic examination also demonstrated unusual findings and showed features of both acute and chronic lichenoid GVHD. CONCLUSIONS: Donor leukocyte infusions without GVHD prophylaxis may provoke a severe fatal hyperacute GVHD. In the cases presented herein, we discuss the significance of the rapid clinical evolution from acute to lichenoid and the combination of histologic features of both acute and chronic GVHD in the biopsy specimens.","['Fernandez-Herrera, J', 'Valks, R', 'Feal, C', 'Fraga, J', 'Tomas, J F', 'Garcia-Diez, A']","['Fernandez-Herrera J', 'Valks R', 'Feal C', 'Fraga J', 'Tomas JF', 'Garcia-Diez A']","['Department of Dermatology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', '*Leukocytes', 'Male']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archderm.135.3.304 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1999 Mar;135(3):304-8. doi: 10.1001/archderm.135.3.304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Maternal occupational data already collected as part of the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers have been reviewed. Information on occupations held before, during, and after the pregnancy was sought for 15,041 children dying of cancer in Great Britain in the period 1953-1981, and for an equal number of matched controls. Each period of working was classified under one of five headings: (1) sewing machinist; (2) textile industry workers (other than sewing machinists) with likely exposures to EMF; (3) other machinists and other jobs with likely ""higher"" EMF exposure; (4) other jobs with likely exposure to some EMF, and (5) jobs with little potential for EMF exposure. RESULTS: Relative to risks in the children of mothers who held occupations with little potential for EMF exposure during pregnancy (a category that included housewives), risks of all childhood cancers were close to unity both for the children of sewing machinists (22 case and 31 control mothers, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25) and for the children of other machinists with likely ""higher"" EMF exposures (44 case and 47 control mothers, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.41). Corresponding risks for all childhood leukemias and for all childhood brain cancers were similarly unexceptional. Simultaneous adjustment for social class, maternal age at birth of child, and sibship position had little effect. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings did not indicate that maternal occupational exposure to EMF during pregnancy is a risk factor for childhood leukemias, childhood brain cancers, or the generality of all childhood cancers.","['Sorahan, T', 'Hamilton, L', 'Gardiner, K', 'Hodgson, J T', 'Harrington, J M']","['Sorahan T', 'Hamilton L', 'Gardiner K', 'Hodgson JT', 'Harrington JM']","['Institute of Occupational Health, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, United Kingdom.

We also studied the role of some cytokines in this phenomenon. K562, a human myeloid leukemia cell line, does not express p53 at the mRNA or protein level. In this study, we stably transfected K562 with eukaryotic vectors containing either normal p53 cDNA (pC53-SN3) or mutated p53 (143Val-->Ala) cDNA (pC53-SCX3). Transfectants expressing WT p53 or those expressing mutant p53 are called K562 SN and K562 SM respectively. Many leukemic cell lines undergo apoptosis when de novo WT p53 is expressed alone. In contrast, while the resulting clones (K562 SN and K562 SM) expressed p53, they did not undergo apoptosis. However, when treated with MDM2 mRNA antisense (MDM2 AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), K562 SN demonstrated apoptotic features at both molecular and morphological levels. No change was observed when the other clones (K562 and K562 SM) were treated with MDM2 AS. Apoptosis induced in this manner was associated with a relatively small increase in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. Cells cultured in medium previously supplemented with recombinant human (rh) interleukin (IL)-3 and rh-erythropoietin (Epo) did not undergo apoptosis. Moreover, K562 SN cells were induced to differentiate. This differentiation was evaluated by measuring hemoglobin (Hb) level in cellular extracted proteins and by analyzing erythroid colony number and morphology. High Hb synthesis was obtained when K562 SN cells were cultured with cytokines (IL-3 + Epo) combined with MDM2 AS. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the function of the proto-oncogene MDM2 is to provide a 'feedback' mechanism for the p53-dependent pathway of apoptosis that could be shunted toward differentiation.","['Mahdi, T', 'Alcalay, D', 'Cognard, C', 'Tanzer, J', 'Kitzis, A']","['Mahdi T', 'Alcalay D', 'Cognard C', 'Tanzer J', 'Kitzis A']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Cellulaire et Moleculaire, CHU de Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",1999/03/23 00:00,1999/03/23 00:01,['1999/03/23 00:00'],"['1999/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0248490099800197 [pii]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 1998 Dec;90(9):615-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common pattern of presentation was a reactive arthritis-like syndrome involving the large joints asymmetrically and associated with low back pain. Distinctive features suggesting a paraneoplastic arthritis were severe pain disproportionate to physical findings, a poor response to conventional antirheumatic treatment, and early significant osteopenia or lytic bone lesions. The epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with or without rheumatic manifestations were comparable, except for fever on presentation, the presence of transient metabolic derangement following chemotherapy, and the initial average hemoglobin, hematocrit and serum uric acid values. Moreover, the initial outcome of the two groups was similar, as the early mortality rates were comparable (42.8% vs. 45% for patients with or without arthritis, respectively).

To explore the potential role of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in the regulation of CCR5, we performed phosphorylation experiments in a rat basophilic leukemia cell line stably expressing CCR5. The ability of various CCR5 ligands to stimulate calcium mobilization in these cells correlated with their ability to induce receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, internalization, and GRK association with the receptor. Aminooxypentane-RANTES, a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus infection, has been proposed to act through enhanced CCR5 internalization and inhibition of receptor recycling. Aminooxypentane-RANTES profoundly induced CCR5 phosphorylation, but had no effect on CCR1. In permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia CCR5 cells, monoclonal antibodies with specificity for GRK2/3 inhibited RANTES-induced receptor phosphorylation. Consistent with a role for these kinases in CCR5 regulation, 1-2 x 10(5) copies of GRK2 or GRK3 were found to be expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that RANTES-induced CCR5 phosphorylation selectively occurs on serine residues.

In the present study, the physiological relevance of three putative regulatory protein binding sites found within a 280-base pair region in intron 1 of the c-myc gene was explored. HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were transiently transfected with three different c-myc promoter constructs cloned upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. With the wild-type c-myc promoter construct (pMPCAT), which contains MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites, 1,25-(OH)2D3 was able to decrease CAT activity by 45.4 +/- 7.9% (mean +/- S.E., n = 8). The ability of 1, 25-(OH)2D3 to inhibit CAT activity was significantly decreased to 18. 5 +/- 4.3% (59.3% reversal, p < 0.02) when examined with a MIE1 deletion construct (pMPCAT-MIE1). Moreover, 1,25-(OH)2D3 was completely ineffective at suppressing CAT activity in cells transfected with pMPCAT-287, a construct without MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites (-6.5 +/- 10.9%, p < 0.002). MIE1- and MIE2-binding proteins induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 had similar gel shift mobilities, while MIE3-binding proteins migrated differently. Furthermore, chelerythrine chloride, a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, and a PKCbeta antisense oligonucleotide completely blocked the binding of nuclear proteins induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 to MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3. A 1,25-(OH)2D3-inducible MIE1-binding protein was identified to be HOXB4. HOXB4 levels were significantly increased in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Taken together, these results indicate that HOXB4 is one of the nuclear phosphoproteins involved in c-myc transcription elongation block during HL-60 cell differentiation by 1,25-(OH)2D3.","['Pan, Q', 'Simpson, R U']","['Pan Q', 'Simpson RU']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0632, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA69568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE10337/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genes, myc/drug effects/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/pharmacology', 'Phenanthridines/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', 'Transfection/genetics']",1999/03/20 00:00,1999/03/20 00:01,['1999/03/20 00:00'],"['1999/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.13.8437 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87352-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Mar 26;274(13):8437-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.13.8437.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen children with body weight less than 25 kg, mean age of 3.9 years (1-9 yrs) who had recurrent solid tumors and leukemia were given tumor specific chemotherapy followed by i.v. rhG-CSF (5 microg/kg/d) for stem cell mobilization. Cytaphereses were done through a central venous line (CVL) during the marrow recovery phase (WBC >0.5 x 10(9)/l). The phereses were analyzed separately and assigned to three groups depending on the WBC at the time of the pheresis: Group I (WBC <1.0 x 10(9)/l), Group II [WBC in the range 1.0-3.0 x 10(9)/l] and Group III (WBC >3.0 x 10(9)/l). Samples from each harvest were assayed for cell count, CFU-GM, BFU-E, CD34+ cell count, and tumor cell immunocytology in patients with neuroblastoma (NBL). A median of 3.2 x 10(8) mononuclear cells per kg (MNC/kg), [mean 2.8 x 10(8) MNC/kg, standard error of the mean (SEM) +/- 0.74 (1.1-4.7)] were infused following myeloablative therapy. 78 phereses were performed in 13 children with a median weight of 18 kg (10-25 kg). A median of 5 phereses were performed per patient. There were no significant differences in the percentage and number of CD34+ cells, CFU-GM or BFU-E colonies assayed by plating 0.5 x 10(5) cells. Differences could be found in the total number of MNC (p<0.008) and the number of MNC/kg (p<0.001) between Groups II and III. No tumor cell contamination was detected in the NBL patients by immunocytology. All patients were rescued with PBSC and achieved sustained white cell engraftment (ANC >0.5 x 10(9)/l) at a median of 13.5 d (10-25 d) and platelet engraftment (untransfused platelet count >20.0 x 10(9)/l) at a median of 29 d (12-63 d). The only toxicity encountered during the phereses was thrombocytopenia in 4 patients whose median post-pheresis platelet count was 6.0 x 10(9)/l (3.0-9.01). It is concluded that collection of PBSC in young children is feasible and safe and can be performed through a cuffed CVL at the time of WBC recovery post mobilization with chemotherapy and G-CSF. Cytopheresis can be effectively performed when the peripheral WBC count approaches 1.0 x 10(9)/l. Following stem cell infusion, engraftment was prompt and durable.","['Kletzel, M', 'Longino, R', 'Rademaker, A W', 'Danner-Koptik, K E', 'Olszewski, M', 'Morgan, E R']","['Kletzel M', 'Longino R', 'Rademaker AW', 'Danner-Koptik KE', 'Olszewski M', 'Morgan ER']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Memorial Hospital, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60614, USA. mkletzel@anima.nums.nwu.edu""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Cytapheresis', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/*surgery']",1999/03/20 00:00,1999/03/20 00:01,['1999/03/20 00:00'],"['1999/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 1998 Aug;2(3):191-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the possible contribution of TGF-beta, as secreted by CLL-B cells, on this low proliferative state. CLL-B cells were shown to express TGF-beta RNA and to release bioactive TGF-beta into culture supernatants. Antibody neutralization of endogenously secreted TGF-beta increased the proliferation of CLL-B cells as cultured in the presence of IL-2 or IL-4 or in direct contact with activated CD4+ T cells. In these culture systems, addition of exogenous TGF-beta downregulated basal and cytokineinduced proliferation of CLL-B cells. In contrast, neither neutralization of endogeneous TGF-beta, nor addition of exogeneous TGF-beta changed the proliferation of CLL-B cells as cultured in the CD40 system. In order to further explore this differential antiproliferative effect of TGF-beta, cytokine secretion of B cells and of CD4+ T cells as well as surface marker expression of CD4+ T cells were assessed in relation to TGF-beta: There was no negative effect of TGF-beta on autocrine secretion of TNF-alpha or sCD23 by CLL-B cells. Unlike tonsillar B cells, CLL-B cells cultured alone or in the CD40 system did no release significant amounts of IL-6 or IL-8 into supernatants. Secretion of IL-2 or IL-4 by activated CD4+ T cells was higher, when T cells were cocultured with normal tonsillar B cells than with CLL-B cells. The amount of IL-2 or IL-4 released by CD4+ T cells cocultured in direct contact with tonsillar or CLL-B cells was not consistently influenced either by neutralization of endogenous TGF-beta or by addition of TGF-beta. Exogenous TGF-beta did not downregulate expression of CD40L, CD27, CD28, CD54 or mTNF-alpha by T helper cells activated with anti-CD3 or PHA. In conclusion, autocrine secretion of TGF-beta exhibits an antiproliferative effect on CLL-B cells. This effect is most relevant in B cells cultured in direct contact with activated CD4+ T cells suggesting an indirect mode of action.","['Schuler, M', 'Tretter, T', 'Schneller, F', 'Huber, C', 'Peschel, C']","['Schuler M', 'Tretter T', 'Schneller F', 'Huber C', 'Peschel C']","['Department of Medicine III, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. m.schuler@gmx.net']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Autocrine Communication', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Cell Communication', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",1999/03/20 00:00,1999/03/20 00:01,['1999/03/20 00:00'],"['1999/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(99)80038-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(99)80038-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1999 Feb;200(1):128-39. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(99)80038-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No BLPD was observed following autologous HSCT, so risk factor analyses were confined to the 1542 allogeneic HSCT. Factors assessed were HLA-mismatching (> or = 1 antigen), T cell depletion (TCD), presence of acute GvHD (grades II-IV), donor type (related vs unrelated), age of recipient and donor, and underlying disease. Factors found to be statistically significant included patients transplanted for immune deficiency and CML, donor age > or = 18 years, TCD, and HLA-mismatching, with recipients of combined TCD and HLA-mismatched grafts having the highest incidence. Factors found to be statistically significant in a multiple regression analysis were TCD, donor age and immune deficiency, although 7/8 of the patients with immunodeficiencies and BLPD received a TCD graft from a haploidentical parent. The overall mortality was 92% (24/26). One patient had a spontaneous remission, but subsequently died >1 year later of chronic GVHD. Thirteen patients received therapy for BLPD. Three patients received lymphocyte infusions without response. The only patients with responses and longterm survival received alpha interferon (alphaIFN). Of seven patients treated with alphaIFN there were four responses (one partial and three complete). These data demonstrate that alphaIFN can be an effective agent against BLPD following HSCT, if a timely diagnosis is made.","['Gross, T G', 'Steinbuch, M', 'DeFor, T', 'Shapiro, R S', 'McGlave, P', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Wagner, J E', 'Filipovich, A H']","['Gross TG', 'Steinbuch M', 'DeFor T', 'Shapiro RS', 'McGlave P', 'Ramsay NK', 'Wagner JE', 'Filipovich AH']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinics, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', '*B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/transmission', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology/immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Family', 'Parents', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/03/20 00:00,1999/03/20 00:01,['1999/03/20 00:00'],"['1999/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701554 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Feb;23(3):251-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701554.,PMC7091602,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on these data a pilot study on autologous transplantation of NM/VP-16 purged PBSC for high-risk leukemic patients was recently initiated. Twelve patients (seven females and five males) with a median age of 46 years (range 18-57) have been treated. Two patients had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) resistant to conventional induction treatment, four patients had secondary AML in I complete remission (CR), one patient was in II CR after failing a previous autologous BM transplantation, while two additional AML individuals were in I CR achieved after three or more cycles of induction treatment. Two patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in I CR and one patient with mantle cell lymphoma and leukemic dissemination were also included. Eight patients showed karyotypic abnormalities associated with a poor clinical outcome. The mobilizing regimens included cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone with (n = 6) or without fludarabine (n = 3) followed by subcutaneous administration of G-CSF (5 microg/kg/day until the completion of PBSC collection) and G-CSF alone (n = 3) (15 microg/kg/day). A median of two aphereses (range 1-3) allowed the collection of 7.2 x 10(8) TNC/kg (range 3.4-11.5), 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 2.1-15.3) and 9.2 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg (0.3-236). PBSC were treated with a constant dose of 20 microg of VP-16/ml and a median individual-adjusted dose (survival < or = 5% of steady-state BM CFU-GM) of NM of 0.7 microg/ml (range 0.25-1.25). Eleven patients were reinfused after busulfan (16 mg/kg) and Cy (120 mg/kg) conditioning with a median residual dose of 0.3 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg (0-11.5). The median time to neutrophil engraftment (>0.5 x 10(9)/l) for evaluable patients was 25 days (range 12-59); the median time to platelet transfusion independence (>20 and >50 x 10(9)/l) was 40 days (18-95) and 69 days (29-235), respectively. Hospital discharge occurred at a median of 25 days (18-58) after stem cell reinfusion. Four individuals are alive in CR (n = 3) or with residual nodal disease (n = 1 lymphoma patient) with a follow-up of 32, 26, 3 and 14 months, respectively. Seven patients died due to disease progression or relapse (n = 5) or extrahematological transplant toxicity (n = 2).

Here, we have examined parameters affecting the engraftment of purified human Lin-CD34+CD38- normal and AML cells transplanted at limiting doses into NOD/SCID recipients. Mice transplanted with 500 to 1000 Lin-CD34+CD38- cord blood (CB) or AML cells required the co-transplantation of accessory cells (ACs) or short-term in vivo cytokine treatment for engraftment, whereas transplantation of higher doses (>5000 Lin-CD34+CD38- cells) did not show these requirements suggesting that ACs are effective for both normal and leukemic stem cell engraftment in this model. Mature Lin+CD34- and primitive Lin-CD34+CD38+ cells were capable of acting as ACs even though no repopulating cells are present. Cytokine treatment of NOD/SCID mice could partially replace the requirement for co-transplantation of AC. Furthermore, no difference was seen between the percentage of engrafted mice treated with cytokines for only the first 10 days after transplant compared to those receiving cytokines for the entire time of repopulation. Surprisingly, no engraftment was detected in mice when cytokine treatment was delayed until 10 days posttransplant. Together, these studies suggest that the engraftment process requires pluripotent stem cells plus accessory cells or cytokine treatment which act early after transplantation. The NOD/SCID xenotransplant system provides the means to further clarify the processes underlying human stem cell engraftment.","['Bonnet, D', 'Bhatia, M', 'Wang, J C', 'Kapp, U', 'Dick, J E']","['Bonnet D', 'Bhatia M', 'Wang JC', 'Kapp U', 'Dick JE']","['Department of Genetics, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/*transplantation', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/immunology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Graft Enhancement, Immunologic', 'Graft Survival/drug effects/*immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/transplantation', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Stem Cell Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*immunology']",1999/03/20 00:00,1999/03/20 00:01,['1999/03/20 00:00'],"['1999/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701564 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Feb;23(3):203-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701564.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 50 cases have been reported since its first description in 1990. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: Clinical signs are polymorphous resembling the cutaneomucosal manifestations of pemphigus vulgar (skin and mucosa erosions, fragile interdermal bullae), pemphigoid (urticaria, distended subepidermal bullae), and polymorphous erythema (plaque lesions). Mucosal erosions predominate however. ASSOCIATED CANCERS: Most cancers associated with paraneoplastic pemphigus are hematologic diseases (non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, chronic lymphoid leukemia). SEVERE PROGNOSIS: No standard treatment has been defined. General corticosteroids and treatment of the causal disease are indicated. The clinical course of paraneoplastic pemphigus does not always follow the course of the associated neoplasm. POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pathology criteria (keratinocyte necrosis, suprabasal keratinocyte vacuolization, intraepidermal acantholysis) and immunohistological findings (antibody and complement deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction and within the keratinocytes on different epithelial substrates) are insufficient for positive diagnosis. Autoantibodies must be identified by immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting to identify the target antigen complex plakin components (desmoplakin I and II, periplakin, envoplakin), the major pemphigoid antigen, desmoglein 3, and certain yet unidentified antigens with a molecular weight of 170 kD. PATHOGENESIS: Paraneoplastic pemphigus appears as a model autoimmune paraneoplastic disease. Its origin remains elusive. It has been hypothesized that tumor-induced inhibition of tolerance to certain antigens implicated in the keratinocyte junctional systems could be involved.","['Descamps, V', 'Belaich, S']","['Descamps V', 'Belaich S']","['Service de dermatologie, hopital Bichat, Paris.']",['fre'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,['0 (Autoantigens)'],IM,"['Autoantigens/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'Castleman Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/complications/*immunology', 'Pemphigus/complications/*immunology', 'Thymoma/complications']",1999/03/20 00:00,1999/03/20 00:01,['1999/03/20 00:00'],"['1999/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1999 Feb 20;28(7):363-7.,,45,,,,Pemphigus paraneoplasique.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
