Newly diagnosed cases of haematological malignancies in the paediatric age group were included in the study. HbF levels were estimated in each case of the study group along with HbF levels of control group comprising healthy children of same age group. The estimation was done by HPLC and Modified Betke's method. 50 cases of newly diagnosed haematological malignancies were studied out of which most of the cases were of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) [n = 30(60 %)] followed by acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) [n = 8(16 %)], Hodgkin's lymphoma [n = 7(14%)], non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [n = 5(10 %)]. Raised HbF levels were found in 43.3 % cases of ALL (13/30) and 37.5 % cases of AML (3/8). No significant rise in HbF level was found in cases of lymphomas. There was correlation between raised HbF level and poor prognostic factors in cases of ALL but no such correlation was found in cases of AML. HbF levels are often elevated in childhood leukaemias as compared to childhood lymphomas. Thus, the concentration of HbF in acute childhood leukaemia may be considered as a prognostic factor.","['Mallick, Debjani', 'Karmakar, Rupam', 'Barui, Gopinath', 'Gon, Sonia', 'Chakrabarti, Sudipta']","['Mallick D', 'Karmakar R', 'Barui G', 'Gon S', 'Chakrabarti S']","['Department of Pathology, ESI PGIMSR & ESIC Medical College, Joka, Diamond Harbour Road, Kolkata, 700104 West Bengal India.', 'Department of Pathology, RG Kar Medical College, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Malda Medical College, English Bazar, West Bengal India.', 'Department of Pathology, ESI PGIMSR & ESIC Medical College, Joka, Diamond Harbour Road, Kolkata, 700104 West Bengal India.', 'Department of Pathology, ESI PGIMSR, Manicktala, Kolkata, West Bengal India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140423,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC4275518,['NOTNLM'],"['Foetal haemoglobin', 'Paediatric haematological malignancies']",2014/12/31 06:00,2014/12/31 06:01,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2013/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-014-0383-3 [doi]', '383 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2015 Mar;31(1):116-20. doi: 10.1007/s12288-014-0383-3.

About 45 % of de novo adult AML and 20 % of pediatric AML lack cytogenetic abnormalities, so identification of predictive molecular markers might improve therapy. Mutation status of FLT3, NPM1 genes and gene expression levels of ERG, BAALC have been postulated as possible prognostic markers in pediatric AML with normal karyotype. Pretreatment blood samples from 47 cytogenetically normal AML patients were analysed for BAALC and ERG expression using real time RT-PCR. The patients were dichotomized at BAALC and ERG mean expression into low and high expression based on the median expression as cutoff. BAALC showed high expression in (24/47; 51.1 %) of patients and ERG high expression was detected in (22/47; 46.6 %). With follow-up for 1 year, patients with high BAALC and high ERG had inferior EFS (P = 0.001, P = 0.017 respectively), overall survival (P = 0.001, 0.08 respectively), and low rates of induction remission (P = 0.001, P = 0.0017 respectively) as compared to those with low expression. Also there was significant positive association between high expression of BAALC; ERG and FLT-ITD mutations (P = 0.016; P = 0.007 respectively). Multivariable analysis confirmed that high BAALC expression is an independent risk factor for EFS [HR for EFS 1.9(1.04-3.46) P = 0.037]; and OS [HR OS 1.55(1.7-3.36) P = 0.03].

Studies on the processes of blood cell formation have revealed several shortcomings as a consequence of chronological age. They include a reduced ability to mount adaptive immune responses and a blood cell composition skewed toward myeloid cells, with the latter coinciding with a dramatically increased incidence of myelogenous diseases, including cancer. Conversely, the dominant forms of acute leukemia affecting children associate with the lymphoid lineages. A growing body of evidence has suggested that aging of various organs and cellular systems, including the hematopoietic system, associates with a functional demise of tissue-resident stem cell populations. Mechanistically, DNA damage and/or altered transcriptional landscapes appear to be major drivers of the hematopoietic stem cell aging state, with recent data proposing that stem cell aging phenotypes are characterized by at least some degree of reversibility. These findings suggest the possibility of rejuvenating, or at least dampening, stem cell aging phenotypes in the elderly for therapeutic benefit.","['Wahlestedt, Martin', 'Pronk, Cornelis Jan', 'Bryder, David']","['Wahlestedt M', 'Pronk CJ', 'Bryder D']","['Immunology Section, Institution for Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Immunology Section, Institution for Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Immunology Section, Institution for Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden David.Bryder@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141229,United States,Stem Cells Transl Med,Stem cells translational medicine,101578022,PMC4303356,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'Epigenetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic stem cell aging', 'Rejuvenation']",2014/12/31 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['sctm.2014-0132 [pii]', '10.5966/sctm.2014-0132 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Transl Med. 2015 Feb;4(2):186-94. doi: 10.5966/sctm.2014-0132.

The current treatment options of corticosteroids, transfusions, and immunosuppressants have been limited and largely unsuccessful, and they can be accompanied by multiple complications. Intrapulmonary administration of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been reported in adults, but there are scarce data on its use in children. The present article reviews our institutional experience with intrapulmonary rFVIIa for the treatment of DAH in children. The study included 6 pediatric patients with acute, bronchoscopically confirmed DAH treated between 2011 and 2013. The median age was 11 years, and patient diagnoses were as follows: acute myeloid leukemia (2 patients), myelodysplastic syndrome (1 patient), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (1 patient), T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (1 patient), and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (1 patient). These patients were treated with intrapulmonary rFVIIa concurrent with methylprednisolone, fresh-frozen plasma, and maintenance of the platelet count >50 000/mm(3). Complete and sustained hemostasis after rFVIIa treatment and an absence of adverse events were observed in all patients. The PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio increased significantly, and rapid clinical improvements were observed. Two patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation died of subsequent respiratory syncytial virus and Acinetobacter baumannii infections, but the other 4 patients exhibited rapid improvement, were successfully weaned from ventilators, and experienced long-term survival. Our findings indicate that intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa is an effective and safe treatment option for children with DAH; however, further clinical studies are needed.","['Park, Jeong A', 'Kim, Byoung-Ju']","['Park JA', 'Kim BJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Haeundae-Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea jeonga95@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Haeundae-Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,['NOTNLM'],"['factor VIIa', 'hemoptysis', 'pediatrics', 'pulmonary alveolar']",2014/12/31 06:00,2015/03/07 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2014-1782 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2014-1782 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2015 Jan;135(1):e216-20. doi: 10.1542/peds.2014-1782.,['Copyright (c) 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Child', 'Factor VIIa/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lung Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Pulmonary Alveoli', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage']","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'AC71R787OV (recombinant FVIIa)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signaling pathways orchestrated by leukemia inhibitor factor/STAT3, Wnt/beta-catenin, and FGF/MEK/ERK play key roles in the generation of pluripotency. However, the function of TGF-beta signaling in this process remains elusive. Here we show that inhibiting TGF-beta signaling with its inhibitor SB431542 can substitute for Oct4 during reprogramming. Moreover, inhibiting TGF-beta signaling can sustain the pluripotency of iPSCs and ES cells through modulating FGF/MEK/ERK signaling. Therefore, this study reveals a novel function of TGF-beta signaling inhibition in the generation and maintenance of PSCs.","['Tan, Fangzhi', 'Qian, Cheng', 'Tang, Ke', 'Abd-Allah, Saber Mohamed', 'Jing, Naihe']","['Tan F', 'Qian C', 'Tang K', 'Abd-Allah SM', 'Jing N']","['From the State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', 'From the State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', 'the Institute of Life Science, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330031, China, and.', 'the Theriogenology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef 62511, Egypt.', 'From the State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China, njing@sibcb.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141229,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC4326853,['NOTNLM'],"['ERK', 'ES Cell', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)', 'Oct4', 'Reprogramming', 'TGF-beta']",2014/12/31 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)47033-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.609016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Feb 13;290(7):4500-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.609016.

A remaining challenge is to increase and guide the specificities of anticancer immune responses, e.g., by therapeutic vaccination or by adoptive T-cell transfer. By analyzing the landscape of naturally presented HLA class I and II ligands of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we delineated a novel category of tumor-associated T-cell antigens based on their exclusive and frequent representation in the HLA ligandome of leukemic cells. These antigens were validated across different stages and mutational subtypes of CLL and found to be robustly represented in HLA ligandomes of patients undergoing standard chemo-/immunotherapy. We demonstrate specific immune recognition of these antigens exclusively in CLL patients, with the frequencies of representation in CLL ligandomes correlating with the frequencies of immune recognition by patient T cells. Moreover, retrospective survival analysis revealed survival benefits for patients displaying immune responses to these antigens. These results directly imply these nonmutant self-peptides as pathophysiologically relevant tumor antigens and encourages their implementation for cancer immunotherapy.","['Kowalewski, Daniel J', 'Schuster, Heiko', 'Backert, Linus', 'Berlin, Claudia', 'Kahn, Stefan', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Stevanovic, Stefan', 'Stickel, Juliane Sarah']","['Kowalewski DJ', 'Schuster H', 'Backert L', 'Berlin C', 'Kahn S', 'Kanz L', 'Salih HR', 'Rammensee HG', 'Stevanovic S', 'Stickel JS']","['Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany;', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany;', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany; Applied Bioinformatics, Center for Bioinformatics and Department of Computer Science, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany;', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany; Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany;', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Unit Translational Immunology, DKFZ Partner Site Tubingen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Tubingen 72076, Germany; and.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany; DKFZ Partner Site Tubingen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Tubingen 72076, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany; DKFZ Partner Site Tubingen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Tubingen 72076, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen 72076, Germany; juliane.stickel@med.uni-tuebingen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141229,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC4299203,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'therapeutic vaccination', 'tumor-associated antigens']",2014/12/31 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1416389112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1416389112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Jan 13;112(2):E166-75. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1416389112.

With the implementation of serological and molecular testing, at least in high-income countries, transfusion-transmitted infections have become extremely rare. However, for pathogen agents, which are not tested and especially those which are responsible for emerging infectious disease, it became apparent that full control of infectious disease had not been achieved. In addition, the immune status of the recipient has also an impact in the outcome of infectious diseases transmitted by transfusion. Blood safety is based on several measures: education and deferral of donors with risk factors for transmissible disease, blood testing, pathogen reduction interventions, and patient blood management.

METHODS: The cytomorphology, biopsy and FCM tests were performed concurrently on bone marrow samples from 206 patients who were consecutively diagnosed as NHL from March 2013 to August 2013 at Peking University Cancer Hospital. The results were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Totally bone marrow involvement occurred in 25.7% (53/206) patients. The detection positivity of bone marrow involvement by cytomorphology, biopsy and flow cytometry were 6/14, 6/14 and 9/14 respectively in 14 T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) patients; 9.2% (14/152) , 19.1% (29/152) and 23.7% (36/152) respectively in 152 mature B-cell NHL patients; 0 (0/40) , 15.0% (6/40) and 2.5% (1/40) in 40 cases of mature T/NK-cell NHL.

Through a large-scale synthetic lethal RNAi screen, we identified pyruvate dehydrogenase, the limiting enzyme for pyruvate entry into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, as critical for the survival of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells upon BCR-ABL inhibition. Here, we examined the role of mitochondrial metabolism in the survival of Ph(+) leukemia and AML upon TK inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ph(+) cancer cell lines, AML cell lines, leukemia xenografts, cord blood, and patient samples were examined. RESULTS: We showed that the mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor oligomycin-A greatly sensitized leukemia cells to TKI in vitro. Surprisingly, oligomycin-A sensitized leukemia cells to BCR-ABL inhibition at concentrations of 100- to 1,000-fold below those required for inhibition of respiration. Oligomycin-A treatment rapidly led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization and reduced ATP levels, and promoted superoxide production and leukemia cell apoptosis when combined with TKI. Importantly, oligomycin-A enhanced elimination of BCR-ABL(+) leukemia cells by TKI in a mouse model and in primary blast crisis CML samples. Moreover, oligomycin-A also greatly potentiated the elimination of FLT3-dependent AML cells when combined with an FLT3 TKI, both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: TKI therapy in leukemia cells creates a novel metabolic state that is highly sensitive to particular mitochondrial perturbations. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism as an adjuvant therapy could therefore improve therapeutic responses to TKI for patients with BCR-ABL(+) and FLT3(ITD) leukemias.","['Alvarez-Calderon, Francesca', 'Gregory, Mark A', 'Pham-Danis, Catherine', 'DeRyckere, Deborah', 'Stevens, Brett M', 'Zaberezhnyy, Vadym', 'Hill, Amanda A', 'Gemta, Lelisa', 'Kumar, Amit', 'Kumar, Vijay', 'Wempe, Michael F', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Serkova, Natalie J', 'Graham, Douglas K', 'DeGregori, James']","['Alvarez-Calderon F', 'Gregory MA', 'Pham-Danis C', 'DeRyckere D', 'Stevens BM', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Hill AA', 'Gemta L', 'Kumar A', 'Kumar V', 'Wempe MF', 'Pollyea DA', 'Jordan CT', 'Serkova NJ', 'Graham DK', 'DeGregori J']","['Integrated Department of Immunology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A survey of patients treated at Charing Cross Hospital between 1958 and 2000 was performed in 2006 to assemble incidence data for subsequent malignancies and the age at menopause. Treatment records were reviewed for the regimens and durations, and the incidence of subsequent malignancies was compared with that in the national age-matched population. RESULTS: Data were obtained for 1,903 patients, with a mean follow-up of 16.9 years. Eighty-six patients developed a subsequent malignancy compared with an expected number of 79 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3). The overall risk was low for patients treated with single-agent methotrexate and folinic acid (MTX-FA; SIR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.1) and also for patients treated with etoposide, methotrexate, and dactinomycin followed by cyclophosphamide and vincristine on alternating weeks (EMA-CO) with an SIR of 0.9 (95% CI, 0.4 to 2.2), but there were significantly increased risks of oral cancer, melanoma, meningioma, and leukemia. The cumulative risk of early menopause was low after MTX-FA but was substantial after EMA-CO, reaching 13% by age 40 years and 36% by age 45 years. CONCLUSION: Subsequent cancer risks for patients cured of gestational trophoblastic tumors with modern chemotherapy appear similar to those of the normal population with no overall increased risk of malignancy after MTX-FA or EMA-CO. However, there was evidence of an increased risk of leukemia after EMA-CO and some evidence of other site-specific increased risks based on small patient numbers. All major treatments except MTX-FA increased the risk of early menopause.","['Savage, Philip', 'Cooke, Rosie', ""O'Nions, Jenny"", 'Krell, Jon', 'Kwan, Amy', 'Camarata, Michelle', 'Dancy, Gairin', 'Short, Dee', 'Seckl, Michael J', 'Swerdlow, Anthony']","['Savage P', 'Cooke R', ""O'Nions J"", 'Krell J', 'Kwan A', 'Camarata M', 'Dancy G', 'Short D', 'Seckl MJ', 'Swerdlow A']","[""Philip Savage, Jenny O'Nions, Jon Krell, Amy Kwan, Michelle Camarata, Gairin Dancy, Dee Short, and Michael J.

To assess the predictive value with regard to allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT), we compared the clinical course of patients with NPM1(mut) AML eligible for allogeneic SCT in a donor versus no-donor analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 1,179 patients with AML (age 18 to 60 years) treated in the Study Alliance Leukemia AML 2003 trial, we identified all NPM1(mut) patients with an intermediate-risk karyotype. According to the trial protocol, patients were intended to receive an allogeneic SCT if an HLA-identical sibling donor was available. Patients with no available donor received consolidation or autologous SCT. We compared relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) depending on the availability of a suitable donor. RESULTS: Of 304 eligible patients, 77 patients had a sibling donor and 227 had no available matched family donor. The 3-year RFS rates in the donor and no-donor groups were 71% and 47%, respectively (P = .005); OS rates were 70% and 60%, respectively (P = .114). In patients with normal karyotype and no FLT3 internal tandem duplication (n = 148), the 3-year RFS rates in the donor and no-donor groups were 83% and 53%, respectively (P = .004); and the 3-year OS rates were 81% and 75%, respectively (P = .300). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic SCT led to a significantly prolonged RFS in patients with NPM1(mut) AML. The absence of a statistically significant difference in OS is most likely a result of the fact that NPM1(mut) patients who experienced relapse responded well to salvage treatment. Allogeneic SCT in first remission has potent antileukemic efficacy and is a valuable treatment option in patients with NPM1(mut) AML with a sibling donor.","['Rollig, Christoph', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Wandt, Hannes', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Aulitzky, Walter E', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Krug, Utz', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Wermke, Martin', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Krause, Stefan W', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Rollig C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Kramer M', 'Thiede C', 'Ho AD', 'Kramer A', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Wandt H', 'Hanel M', 'Einsele H', 'Aulitzky WE', 'Schmitz N', 'Berdel WE', 'Stelljes M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Krug U', 'Platzbecker U', 'Wermke M', 'Baldus CD', 'Krause SW', 'Stolzel F', 'von Bonin M', 'Schaich M', 'Serve H', 'Schetelig J', 'Ehninger G']","['Christoph Rollig, Martin Bornhauser, Michael Kramer, Christian Thiede, Uwe Platzbecker, Martin Wermke, Friedrich Stolzel, Malte von Bonin, Markus Schaich, Johannes Schetelig, and Gerhard Ehninger, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum der Technischen Universitat Dresden; Johannes Schetelig, DKMS, German Bone Marrow Donor Center, Dresden; Anthony D.

The ability to identify patients at risk for these infections and administer appropriate empiric therapy, particularly during episodes of neutropenia, may improve outcomes and also direct infection control and antimicrobial stewardship efforts. Many transplant centers obtain routine surveillance stool cultures (SSCs) from HCT recipients to test for colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Our center initiated the performance of SSCs for P. aeruginosa, because of a perceived increase in the frequency of infection with MDR strains. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of this practice. METHODS: We conducted a 2-year (2010-2011) retrospective review of the medical records of all patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at our cancer center to (a) determine the frequency of fecal colonization with P. aeruginosa, including MDR strains; (b) to determine the overall frequency of subsequent P. aeruginosa infection, as well as the frequency of infection with MDR strains; (c) to ascertain the proportion of subsequent infections likely arising from the intestinal tract; and (d) to determine risk factors for progression from colonization to infection. RESULTS: Of 794 study patients, 58 (7.3%) had at least 1 positive SSC for P. aeruginosa; 19/58 (32.8%) developed a subsequent pseudomonal infection (11 with matching antimicrobial resistance patterns). On the other hand, 37/736 (5%) of the patients who were not colonized, developed a pseudomonal infection. The type of infection observed was pneumonia in 26 (46%) patients, bloodstream infection in 20 (36%), urinary tract infection in 8 (14%), and infections at other sites in 2 (4%). The incidence of MDR P. aeruginosa in the entire cohort was 2.2% (18 of 794): 12 had positive SSCs and 7 of these patients later developed MDR P. aeruginosa infections. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia were more likely to be colonized and to develop subsequent infection. No infection-related deaths were observed during the first 30 days after infection. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of P. aeruginosa colonization and subsequent infection was low. Patients who were not colonized had a low chance of developing P. aeruginosa infection. Most patients who developed infection did not have fecal colonization, suggesting a different source of infection. SSCs for P. aeruginosa provide incomplete information regarding the source of infection.","['Nesher, L', 'Rolston, K V I', 'Shah, D P', 'Tarrand, J T', 'Mulanovich, V', 'Ariza-Heredia, E J', 'Chemaly, R F']","['Nesher L', 'Rolston KV', 'Shah DP', 'Tarrand JT', 'Mulanovich V', 'Ariza-Heredia EJ', 'Chemaly RF']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141227,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'multidrug-resistant', 'stem cell transplantation', 'stool culture', 'surveillance']",2014/12/30 06:00,2017/04/14 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12323 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2015 Feb;17(1):33-8. doi: 10.1111/tid.12323.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of disease status at SCT on the outcomes of SCT for these children, whose prognosis is considered unquestionably poor even with SCT. PROCEDURE: The medical records of 55 children with ALL who underwent SCT following the experience of re-induction failure (n = 25) or multiple relapses (n = 30) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent SCT in CR (delayed CR2, CR3, and CR4) and 34 in non-CR (first or subsequent relapse). The probability of overall survival of patients with CR and with non-CR at SCT was 42.9% and 23.5% (P = 0.15), leukemia-free survival was 38.1% and 20.6% (P = 0.18), and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 23.8% and 50%, respectively (P = 0.05). In multivariate analysis, non-CR at SCT was a significant risk factor for higher relapse incidence and male sex was a significant risk factor for lower survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that in case of tolerable patient condition, further re-induction chemotherapy might be reasonable so that SCT could be performed in CR, which might result in a low incidence of relapse after SCT. Novel approaches are required to induce CR for the treatment of children with relapsed/refractory ALL.","['Inagaki, Jiro', 'Fukano, Reiji', 'Noguchi, Maiko', 'Kurauchi, Koichiro', 'Tanioka, Shinji', 'Okamura, Jun']","['Inagaki J', 'Fukano R', 'Noguchi M', 'Kurauchi K', 'Tanioka S', 'Okamura J']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141224,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['disease status at transplantation', 'multiple relapse', 'pediatric ALL', 're-induction failure', 'stem cell transplantation']",2014/12/30 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25353 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Apr;62(4):674-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25353.

These approaches, however, do not allow an unbiased study of protein complexes that bind to certain DNA sequences. DNA pulldowns from crude lysates combined with quantitative mass spectrometry were recently introduced to close this gap. Established protocols, however, are restricted to cell lines because they are based on metabolic labeling or require large amounts of material. We introduce a high-throughput-compatible DNA pulldown that combines on-bead digestion with direct dimethyl labeling or label-free protein quantification. We demonstrate that our method can efficiently identify transcription factors binding to their consensus DNA motifs in extracts from primary foreskin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) freshly isolated from human donors. Nuclear proteomes with absolute quantification of nearly 7000 proteins in K562 cells and PBMCs clearly link differential interactions to differences in protein abundance, hence stressing the importance of selecting relevant cell extracts for any interaction in question.

Both effects of IR have been commonly attributed to the direct induction of DNA mutations, but evidence supporting these hypotheses is largely lacking. Here we demonstrate that IR causes long-term, somatically heritable, cell-intrinsic reductions in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell (mHPC) self-renewal that are mediated by C/EBPalpha and reversed by Notch. mHPC from previously irradiated (>9 weeks prior), homeostatically restored mice exhibit gene expression profiles consistent with their precocious differentiation phenotype, including decreased expression of HSC-specific genes and increased expression of myeloid program genes (including C/EBPalpha). These gene expression changes are reversed by ligand-mediated activation of Notch. Loss of C/EBPalpha expression is selected for within previously irradiated HSC and mHPC pools and is associated with reversal of IR-dependent precocious differentiation and restoration of self-renewal. Remarkably, restoration of mHPC self-renewal by ligand-mediated activation of Notch prevents selection for C/EBPalpha loss of function in previously irradiated mHPC pools. We propose that environmental insults prompt HSC to initiate a program limiting their self-renewal, leading to loss of the damaged HSC from the pool while allowing this HSC to temporarily contribute to differentiated cell pools. This ""programmed mediocrity"" is advantageous for the sporadic genotoxic insults animals have evolved to deal with but becomes tumor promoting when the entire HSC compartment is damaged, such as during total body irradiation, by increasing selective pressure for adaptive oncogenic mutations.","['Fleenor, Courtney Jo', 'Rozhok, Andrii Ivan', 'Zaberezhnyy, Vadym', 'Mathew, Divij', 'Kim, Jihye', 'Tan, Aik-Choon', 'Bernstein, Irwin David', 'DeGregori, James']","['Fleenor CJ', 'Rozhok AI', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Mathew D', 'Kim J', 'Tan AC', 'Bernstein ID', 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Immunology, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,PMC4376650,['NOTNLM'],"['Differentiation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Irradiation', 'Leukemia', 'Notch']",2014/12/30 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1936 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Apr;33(4):1345-58. doi: 10.1002/stem.1936.,['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/physiology/*radiation effects', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Receptors, Notch/physiology/*radiation effects']","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",,,"['U01 HL100395/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA180175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5F31CA165688-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA180175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA165688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS650321'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, some acute myeloid leukemias (AML) lack lineage-associated markers. In our experience, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is expressed in immature canine monocytes. We hypothesized that ALP is a useful marker for monocytic AML. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to compare ALP expression in neoplastic cells from dogs with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and AML. METHODS: Alkaline phosphatase results were retrieved from medical records of dogs with acute leukemia. Smears from dogs with lymphoma or leukemia were also prospectively stained for ALP activity. CLL was based on persistent lymphocytosis (10 x 10(9) /L) and acute leukemia on >/= 20% blasts in blood or bone marrow. ALL was classified based on positive phenotyping for T- or B-lymphocyte antigens, and AML on positive phenotyping for CD11b, CD11c or CD14, or cytochemical staining for chloroacetate esterase, Sudan Black B, or myeloperoxidase. RESULTS: There was no ALP activity in all 49 lymphomas and 7 CLLs. Weak ALP activity was seen in 31% of 14 ALL (all T-ALL). ALP activity was seen in all 20 AML (P < .001 vs ALL) with strong activity in 64% (vs 25% ALL) in most neoplastic cells (median 75% vs 9% ALL, P = .020). Of AML, 80% were CD34+ (vs 39% ALL, P = .027) and 100% were MHCII- (vs 43% ALL, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: ALP activity may be useful for AML confirmation in dogs, particularly if neoplastic cells only express CD34+ on immunophenotyping.","['Stokol, Tracy', 'Schaefer, Deanna M', 'Shuman, Martha', 'Belcher, Nicole', 'Dong, Lynn']","['Stokol T', 'Schaefer DM', 'Shuman M', 'Belcher N', 'Dong L']","['Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141226,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'immunophenotyping', 'lymphoma', 'myeloproliferative disorder', 'special stains']",2014/12/30 06:00,2016/05/03 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vcp.12227 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2015 Mar;44(1):79-93. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12227.

To address whether RTC is a feasible approach for pediatric patients with AML in remission, we performed a retrospective investigation of the outcomes of the first transplant in patients who had received an allo-HCT after RTC or standard MAC, using nationwide registration data collected between 2000 and 2011 in Japan. PROCEDURE: We compared a fludarabine (Flu) and melphalan (Mel)-based regimen (RTC; n = 34) with total body irradiation (TBI) and/or busulfan (Bu)-based conditioning (MAC; n = 102) in demographic- and disease-criteria-matched childhood and adolescent patients with AML in first or second complete remission (CR1/CR2). RESULTS: The incidence of engraftment, early complications, grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD were similar in each conditioning group. The risk of relapse (25% vs. 26%) and non-relapse mortality (13% vs. 11%) after 3 years did not differ between these groups, and univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the 3-year overall survival (OS) rates after Flu/Mel-RTC and MAC were comparable (mean, 72% [range, 51-85%] and 68% [range, 58-77%], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the Flu/Mel-RTC regimen is a clinically acceptable conditioning strategy for childhood and adolescent patients with AML in remission. Although this retrospective, registry-based analysis has several limitations, RTC deserves to be further investigated in prospective trials.","['Ishida, Hiroyuki', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Inagaki, Jiro', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Yabe, Hiromasa', 'Kawa, Keisei', 'Kato, Koji', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kudo, Kazuko']","['Ishida H', 'Adachi S', 'Hasegawa D', 'Okamoto Y', 'Goto H', 'Inagaki J', 'Inoue M', 'Koh K', 'Yabe H', 'Kawa K', 'Kato K', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kudo K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan; Division of Pediatrics, Matsushita Memorial Hospital, Moriguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20141224,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'childhood', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'melphalan', 'reduced intensity conditioning', 'reduced toxicity conditioning']",2014/12/30 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25389 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 May;62(5):883-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25389.

No preventive interventions are known. PROCEDURE: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of oral glutamic acid as a preventive agent in pediatric patients with cancer who would be receiving vincristine therapy for at least 9 consecutive weeks (Stratum 1 = Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma) or 4 consecutive weeks in conjunction with steroids (Stratum 2 = Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma). At designated time points, a scored neurologic exam using the Modified Balis Pediatric Scale of Peripheral Neuropathies was performed to document neurologic toxicity. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2012, 250 patients were enrolled (Stratum 1 = 50, Stratum 2 = 200). The glutamic acid treated group did not have a significantly lower percentage of neurotoxicity compared to placebo treated group either overall or within stratum or age subgroups. The only subgroup which was suggestive of treatment effect was for age. Patients 13 years or older showed a larger benefit in favor of glutamic acid (P = 0.055) compared to patients less than 13 years (P = 1.00). Constipation was the most frequently reported (14%) Grade II or higher neurotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Vincristine-associated neurotoxicity in pediatric oncology remains a frequent complication of chemotherapy for multiple diagnoses with an approximate 30% of patients affected. Glutamic acid is not effective for prevention in pre-adolescents.

The current evaluation of CNS involvement based on cytomorphological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alone is not as sensitive with low cell counts as flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) of the CSF. However, the importance of low CSF blasts counts at diagnosis is uncertain. We sought to determine the significance of FCI in relation to conventional morphological examination. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively compared FCI of the CSF with cytomorphology at diagnosis or relapse of childhood ALL. All patients were diagnosed 2000-2012 in Stockholm or Umea, Sweden. Clinical data were collected from medical records and the Nordic leukemia registry. Treatment assignment was based on morphological examination only. RESULTS: The cohort was comprised of 214 patients with ALL. CSF involvement was detected by both methods in 20 patients, in 17 by FCI alone, and in one patient by cytomorphology alone. The relapse rate was higher for patients with negative cytology but positive FCI compared to those without CNS involvement using both methods. The difference was especially marked in the current protocol. However, none of the patients with negative CSF cytology but positive FCI had a CNS relapse. CONCLUSIONS: FCI of the CSF increased the detection rate of CNS involvement of ALL approximately two times compared to cytomorphology. Patients with low-level CNS involvement may benefit from additional intensified systemic or CNS-directed therapy, but larger studies are needed.","['Ranta, Susanna', 'Nilsson, Frans', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Saft, Leonie', 'Tani, Edneia', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Hultdin, Magnus', 'Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Heyman, Mats']","['Ranta S', 'Nilsson F', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Saft L', 'Tani E', 'Soderhall S', 'Porwit A', 'Hultdin M', 'Noren-Nystrom U', 'Heyman M']","[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['cerebrospinal fluid', 'cytology', 'flow cytometric immunophenotyping', 'leukemia']",2014/12/30 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25363 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):951-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25363.

METHODS: Differences between the outcomes of elderly AML patients who received intensive chemotherapy, azacitidine-based therapy or best supportive care are studied in this retrospective review. Patients 60 years or older diagnosed with AML between January 2009 and June 2011 were included. Those who passed away within less than 2 weeks of diagnosis were excluded. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 7.2 months (range: 0.5-26.4 months), estimated median OS for patients who received azacitidine-based therapy was 9.8 months (range: 2.4-22.5 months) compared with 8.9 months (range: 0.9-26.4 months) for patients who received intensive chemotherapy (P=0.89).

The current study investigated neuropsychological outcomes in children with DS treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to children with DS with no history of cancer. PROCEDURE: Participants were 4 to 17 years of age at testing and were administered measures of intelligence, academic achievement, language, visual-motor and fine-motor skills, and adaptive function. Patients had been off treatment for at least 2 years. RESULTS: The AML group (N = 12) had significantly lower verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary compared to controls (N = 21). By contrast, the ALL group (N = 14) performed significantly worse than controls on measures of verbal intelligence, spelling, receptive and expressive vocabulary, visual-motor skills, and adaptive function. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DS treated for AML may have specific post-treatment morbidity in verbal function, whereas those treated for ALL have broader morbidity affecting multiple neuropsychological domains and overall adaptive function. We hypothesize that the broader impairment profile of ALL survivors may be related to a combination of the longer duration of central nervous system-directed treatment for ALL compared to AML and the concomitant limited access to intervention opportunities during active treatment.","['Roncadin, Caroline', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'Downie, Andrea', 'Montour-Proulx, Isabelle', 'Alyman, Cheryl', 'Cairney, Elizabeth', 'Spiegler, Brenda J']","['Roncadin C', 'Hitzler J', 'Downie A', 'Montour-Proulx I', 'Alyman C', 'Cairney E', 'Spiegler BJ']","['The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['Down syndrome', 'late effects', 'leukemia']",2014/12/30 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25362 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 May;62(5):854-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25362.

In this analysis, we have examined the value of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in combination with CD34 expression for the separation of HSC from LSC in 104 patients with de novo AML. The majority of AML patients (80 out of 104) had low percentages of cells with high ALDH activity (ALDH(+) cells; <1.9%; ALDH-rare AML), whereas 24 patients had relatively numerous ALDH(+) cells (>/=1.9%; ALDH-numerous AML). In patients with ALDH-rare AML, normal HSC could be separated by their CD34(+) ALDH(+) phenotype, whereas LSC were exclusively detected among CD34(+) ALDH(-) cells. For patients with ALDH-numerous AML, the CD34(+) ALDH(+) subset consisted mainly of LSC and separation from HSC was not feasible. Functional analyses further showed that ALDH(+) cells from ALDH-numerous AML were quiescent, refractory to ARA-C treatment and capable of leukemic engraftment in a xenogenic mouse transplantation model. Clinically, resistance to chemotherapy and poor long-term outcome were also characteristic for patients with ALDH-numerous AML providing an additional risk-stratification tool. The difference in spectrum and relevance of ALDH activity in the putative LSC populations demonstrates, in addition to phenotypic and genetic, also functional heterogeneity of leukemic cells and suggests divergent roles for ALDH activity in normal HSC versus LSC. By acknowledging these differences our study provides a new and useful tool for prospective identification of AML cases in which separation of HSC from LSC is possible.","['Hoang, Van T', 'Buss, Eike C', 'Wang, Wenwen', 'Hoffmann, Isabel', 'Raffel, Simon', 'Zepeda-Moreno, Abraham', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Lutz, Christoph']","['Hoang VT', 'Buss EC', 'Wang W', 'Hoffmann I', 'Raffel S', 'Zepeda-Moreno A', 'Baran N', 'Wuchter P', 'Eckstein V', 'Trumpp A', 'Jauch A', 'Ho AD', 'Lutz C']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGMBH), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Child and Youth Cancer Research Institute, University Center for Health Sciences, University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGMBH), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150114,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,PMC4755039,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'aldehyde dehydrogenase', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'high risk factor', 'leukemia stem cell']",2014/12/30 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29410 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Aug 1;137(3):525-36. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29410.

A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the remission rate and survival with GCLAC were superior to FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF) in the relapsed setting. We therefore initiated a study of the GCLAC regimen in the upfront setting in a multicenter trial. The objectives were to evaluate the rates of complete remission (CR), overall and relapse-free survival (OS and RFS), and toxicity of GCLAC. Clofarabine was administered at 30 mg m(-2) day(-1) x 5 and cytarabine at 2 g m(-2) day(-1) x 5 after G-CSF priming in 50 newly-diagnosed patients ages 18-64 with AML or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Responses were assessed in the different cytogenetic risk groups and in patients with antecedent hematologic disorder. The overall CR rate was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64-88%) and the CR + CRp (CR with incomplete platelet count recovery) was 82% (95% CI 71-93%). The CR rate was 100% for patients with favorable, 84% for those with intermediate, and 62% for those with unfavorable risk cytogenetics.

Having recently demonstrated that the mitochondria-targeting small molecule sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) exhibits anti-leukemic activity in p53wild-type B-CLL cells, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DCA in p53mutated B-CLL cells and in p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines. DCA exhibited comparable cytotoxicity in p53wild-type and p53mutated B-CLL patient cell cultures, as well as in p53mutated B leukemic cell lines (MAVER, MEC-1, MEC-2). At the molecular level, DCA promoted the transcriptional induction of p21 in all leukemic cell types investigated, including p53null HL-60. By using a proteomic approach, we demonstrated that DCA up-regulated the ILF3 transcription factor, which is a known regulator of p21 expression. The role of the ILF3/p21 axis in mediating the DCA anti-leukemic activity was underscored by knocking-down experiments. Indeed, transfection with ILF3 and p21 siRNAs significantly decreased both the DCA-induced p21 expression and the DCA-mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results emphasize that DCA is a small molecule that merits further evaluation as a therapeutic agent also for p53mutated leukemic cells, by acting through the induction of a p53-independent pathway.","['Agnoletto, Chiara', 'Brunelli, Laura', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Pastorelli, Roberta', 'Casciano, Fabio', 'Rimondi, Erika', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Agnoletto C', 'Brunelli L', 'Melloni E', 'Pastorelli R', 'Casciano F', 'Rimondi E', 'Rigolin GM', 'Cuneo A', 'Secchiero P', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Institute of Pharmacological Researches, IRCCS ""Mario Negri"", Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Life Science, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara-Arcispedale S.

This co-culture system induced proliferation and chemoresistance in primary CLL cells. Importantly, co-cultured primary CLL cells shared many phenotypical features with circulating proliferative CLL cells, such as upregulation of ZAP-70 and CD38 and higher CD49d and CD62L expression. This indicates aggressiveness and capability to interact with surrounding cells, respectively. In addition, levels of CXCR4 were decreased due to CXCR4 internalization after CXCL12 stimulation by BM stromal cells.

Retrovirally transduced Mixl1 is reported to induce acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with a high penetrance. But the mechanistic underpinnings of MIXL1 mediated leukemogenesis are unknown. Here, we establish the protooncogene c-REL to be a transcriptional target of MIXL1 by genome wide chromatin immune precipitation. Accordingly, expression of c-REL and its downstream targets BCL2L1 and BCL2A2 are elevated in MIXL1 expressing cells. Notably, MIXL1 regulates c-REL through a zinc finger binding motif, potentially by a MIXL1-Zinc finger protein transcriptional complex. Furthermore, MIXL1 expression is detected in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) AML samples in a pattern mutually exclusive from that of HOXA9, CDX2 and HLX suggesting the existence of a core, yet distinct HOX transcriptional program. Finally, we demonstrate MIXL1 to be induced by BMP4 and not TGF-beta in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Consequently, MIXL1 expressing AML cells are preferentially sensitive to the BMPR1 kinase inhibitor LDN-193189. These findings support the existence of a novel MIXL1-c REL mediated survival axis in AML that can be targeted by BMPR1 inhibitors.

DESIGN: Study of death certificate data. METHODS: We included deaths of older (65 + years) people whose underlying cause of death was a dementia-related disease (ICD-10: F01, F02, F03, G30) in Belgium, the Netherlands, England, Wales, France, Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary, New Zealand, United States, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. We examined associations between place of death and sociodemographic factors, social support, and residential and health care system factors. RESULTS: Overall, 4.8% of all deaths were from a dementia-related disease, ranging from 0.4% in Mexico to 6.9% in Canada. Of those deaths, the proportion occurring in hospital varied from 1.6% in the Netherlands to 73.6% in South Korea. When controlling for potential confounders, hospital death was more likely for men, those younger than 80, and those married or living in a region with a higher availability of long-term care beds, although this could not be concluded for each country. Hospital death was least likely in the Netherlands compared with other countries. CONCLUSIONS: Place of death of older people who died from a dementia-related disease differs substantially between countries, which might point to organizational differences in end-of-life care provision. Increasing the availability of long-term care beds might be important to reduce the number of hospital deaths, while focusing specialized end-of-life care services on married people or those aged 65 to 79 might be crucial for achieving home death. However, proper end-of-life care needs to be ensured in hospitals, should this be the most appropriate end-of-life care setting.","['Reyniers, Thijs', 'Deliens, Luc', 'Pasman, H Roeline', 'Morin, Lucas', 'Addington-Hall, Julia', 'Frova, Luisa', 'Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje', 'Naylor, Wayne', 'Ruiz-Ramos, Miguel', 'Wilson, Donna M', 'Loucka, Martin', 'Csikos, Agnes', 'Rhee, Yong Joo', 'Teno, Joan', 'Cohen, Joachim', 'Houttekier, Dirk']","['Reyniers T', 'Deliens L', 'Pasman HR', 'Morin L', 'Addington-Hall J', 'Frova L', 'Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Onwuteaka-Philipsen B', 'Naylor W', 'Ruiz-Ramos M', 'Wilson DM', 'Loucka M', 'Csikos A', 'Rhee YJ', 'Teno J', 'Cohen J', 'Houttekier D']","['Department of Family Medicine & Chronic Care, End-of-Life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Ghent University, Brussels, Belgium.

The RA activity is mediated primarily by members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) subfamily, namely RARalpha, RARbeta and RARgamma, which belong to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of transcription factors. RARs form heterodimers with members of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) subfamily and act as ligand-regulated transcription factors through binding specific RA response elements (RAREs) located in target genes promoters. RARs also have non-genomic effects and activate kinase signaling pathways, which fine-tune the transcription of the RA target genes. The disruption of RA signaling pathways is thought to underlie the etiology of a number of hematological and non-hematological malignancies, including leukemias, skin cancer, head/neck cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, glioblastoma and neuroblastoma. Of note, RA and its derivatives (retinoids) are employed as potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents because of their differentiation, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-oxidant effects. In humans, retinoids reverse premalignant epithelial lesions, induce the differentiation of myeloid normal and leukemic cells, and prevent lung, liver, and breast cancer. Here, we provide an overview of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that regulate the RA and retinoid signaling pathways. Moreover, mechanisms through which deregulation of RA signaling pathways ultimately impact on cancer are examined. Finally, the therapeutic effects of retinoids are reported.","['di Masi, Alessandra', 'Leboffe, Loris', 'De Marinis, Elisabetta', 'Pagano, Francesca', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Rochette-Egly, Cecile', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Ascenzi, Paolo', 'Nervi, Clara']","['di Masi A', 'Leboffe L', 'De Marinis E', 'Pagano F', 'Cicconi L', 'Rochette-Egly C', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Ascenzi P', 'Nervi C']","['Department of Science, Roma Tre University, Viale Guglielmo Marconi 446, Roma I-00146, Italy.', 'Department of Science, Roma Tre University, Viale Guglielmo Marconi 446, Roma I-00146, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, University of Roma ""La Sapienza"", Corso della Repubblica 79, Latina I-04100.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, University of Roma ""La Sapienza"", Corso della Repubblica 79, Latina I-04100.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Roma ""Tor Vergata"", Via Montpellier 1, Roma I-00133, Italy; Laboratory of Neuro-Oncohematology, Santa Lucia Foundation, Via Ardeatina, 306, Roma I-00142, Italy.', 'Department of Functional Genomics and Cancer, IGBMC, CNRS UMR 7104 - Inserm U 964, University of Strasbourg, 1 rue Laurent Fries, BP10142, Illkirch Cedex F-67404, France.

METHODS: Prognostic value of IPSS and IPSS-R was evaluated on clinical data from 159 MDS patients, according to WHO classification. RESULTS: With a median age of 44 years (range:15-80 years), MDS patients had the frequency of 38.56% with abnormal karyotype, including the most common abnormality +8 (20/153, 12.6%). 34 of 142 patients transformed into leukemia. Age and the level of beta2 micro-globulin were the prognostic factors by multivariate analysis and IPSS-R had a better prognostic significance. The differences in cumulative survival between IPSS subgroups were significant (P<0.05) except that between low- and intermediate I-risk group (P>0.05). There were statistical differences for IPSS-R low risk group vs high or very high risk group, and intermediate risk group vs high or very high risk group (P<0.05). IPSS-R enables IPSS subgroups re-stratification and split IPSS intermediate I-risk group into two subgroups with different prognosis. CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in age of onset, distribution of prognosis scoring system subgroups and abnormal karyotype compared with those in Europe and America. The proportion of higher risk (worse than good karyotype) in IPSS-R was higher than that in Europe and America. Age and the level of beta2 micro-globulin were prognostic factors. Both IPSS and IPSS-R were applicable in Chinese MDS patients and the latter performed better. Applying IPSS-R to re-stratify IPSS subgroups helps evaluate prognosis more accurately and improve treatment outcomes.","['Lei, Ye', 'Xu, Xiaoqian', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Zhang, Weiping', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Gong, Shenglan', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Lei Y', 'Xu X', 'Yang J', 'Zhang W', 'Song X', 'Cheng H', 'Gong S', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.12.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Dec;35(12):1090-4. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.12.009.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From March 1998 to November 2010, 107 untreated patients with LBL (age <18 years) were enrolled and stratified into three groups (R1, R2 and R3), according to the stage of disease and response to induction chemotherapy. All patients received different intensive chemotherapy regimens based on a modified NHL-BFM-90 protocol. Total treatment duration was 2 years. RESULTS: Of the 107 patients, 79 were boys and 28 were girls, with a median age of 10 years (range 2.5-18 years). Six patients (5.6%) were stage I/II, 101 (94.4%) stage III/IV. The R1, R2 and R3 groups accounted for 5.6%, 71.0% and 23.4%, respectively. 75.7% of the patients had T-LBL, and 24.3% was B-LBL. At a median follow-up duration of 60 months (range 1-186 months), 24 patients died. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75.5% and 77.8 % for all patients, 100.0% and 100.0% for group R1, 84.5% and 87.5 % for R2, 44.0% and 44.0% for R3, 72% and 73.5% for T-LBL, 86.4% and 88.5% for B-LBL, respectively.

METHODS: The expression level of SHP-1 mRNA and protein in bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CML patients were detected by Western blot and SYBR Green-based qRT-PCR. The methylation status of SHP-1 were assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay. K562 cells were infected with the lentiviral plasmids pEX-SHP-1-puro-Lv105 (K562-SHP-1) or pEX-EGFP-puro-Lv105 (K562-EGFP). The levels of proteins and phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western blot. qRT-PCR assay was used to test the level of BCR-ABL mRNA. RESULTS: The relative levels of SHP-1 mRNA were sharply decreased in advanced stages CML compared to chronic phase (CP)-CML (0.79+/-0.37 vs 1.18+/-0.64, P= 0.009). The level of SHP-1 protein was lower in advanced stages CML compared to CP-CML (0.57+/-0.02 vs 1.02+/-0.04, P=0.039). The frequency of SHP-1 gene promoter methylation at selected loci in CP-CML was 23.8% (10/42), and the methylated regions were detected in all advanced CML samples (P<0.01). SHP-1 was stably transfected into K562 cells and selected with puromycin. Overexpression of SHP-1 inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of K562 cells, meanwhile leaded to G0/G1 phase arrest. After transfection, the level of BCR-ABL mRNA was not affected in K562-SHP-1 cells (1.32+/-0.34) compared to K562-EGFP cells (1.18+/-0.20, P=0.644), but overexpression of SHP-1 caused a slight decrease in BCR-ABL protein in K562-SHP-1 cells compared to K562 -EGFP cells (0.78+/-0.15 vs 1.27+/-0.24, P=0.040). Overexpression of SHP-1 resulted in a remarkable decrease in MYC protein, phosphorylated forms of JAK2, STAT5, Akt and MAPK. However, the un-phosphorylated forms of these molecules were not significantly affected. CONCLUSION: Decreased expression of SHP-1 caused by aberrant promoter hypermethylation may play a key role in the progression of CML by dysregulation of BCR-ABL, Akt, MAPK, MYC, JAK2 and STAT5 signaling.","['Li, Yinghua', 'Wang, Xingzhe', 'Yang, Lin', 'Pan, Yuxia', 'Shang, Yintao', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Yang L', 'Pan Y', 'Shang Y', 'Luo J']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/12/30 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.12.006 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Dec;35(12):1074-8. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.12.006.,,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'RNA, Messenger']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From 1999 to 2010, 822 adult cases with AML were enrolled, diagnosed and classified by the FAB and WHO criteria, respectively. The treatment outcomes and prognostic factors were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In all patients with a median age of 38.5(15-83) years, acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (M5), AML with t(15;17)/PML-RARalpha (APL) and AML with t(8;21)/AML1-ETO(M2b) were the most common subtypes, accounting for 29.7%, 20.9% and 14.6% respectively. In APL patients, CR was achieved in 95.2%, with an early death (ED) rate of 4.8%. And the estimated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 year was 87.5% and 88.8%, respectively. Patients with other AML subtype (Non-APL) revealed a CR rate of 82.0%, ED of 4.3%, and estimated 5-year OS and DFS both of 48.8%. The OS rate of Non-APL patients at 3-year varied significantly (P<0.01) among three prognostic groups by cytogenetic risk stratification:favorable, 69.5%; intermediate, 52.8%; unfavorable, 29.8%. The prognostic factors for OS among Non-APL included age, cytogenetic abnormalities, courses of the median/high-dose cytarabine and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: When compared with the previous reports, the AML patients in our study were younger and showed a different subtype distribution. Treatment outcomes of APL and Non-APL were just the same as those in international leukemia centers.

Currently only allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is one of the most effective treatment ways for AML. The number of transplant patients is limited, because of various reasons, such as the physical condition of patients, donor sources or economic reason. After transplantation, patients also have the possibility of recurrence, therefore, drug treatment is still important after AML remission. At present, NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) recommended high-dose cytarabine as first-line postremission therapy for patients of good prognosis group and as second-line therapy for intermediate risk group. In recent years, researchers have explored other drugs, such as the nucleoside analogues, methyltransferase inhibitors and protease inhibitors or other drugs for the treatment of adult AML patients who is in remission.In this article, the treatment of conventional medicine for the treatment of AML after complete remission is summarized.","['Lan, Feng-Mei', 'Li, Hui-Min']","['Lan FM', 'Li HM']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650032, Yunnan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650032, Yunnan Province, China.

Expression of PTPL1 is low in lymphoma, while it is high in myeloid leukemia. PTPL1 has been regarded as a tumor suppressor in lymphoma, the methylation of PTPL1 promoter leads to gene expression reduced or disappeared, playing a lymphoma tumor suppressor role.

However, with the advanced high-throughput sequencing technology, people tend to view the complex interplay as a whole instead of investigating the abnormality independently. The gene expression profile consisting of variation of methylation, mRNA, microRNA and other information contribute to further specify the leukemia subtype and improve the treatment and prognosis of leukemia.

The responsive rate, adverse reactions, early mortality, relapse and clonal disease were analyzed retrospectively and results between the two groups were compared. Out of 95 patients 43 were boys and 52 were girls, their ages were from 1 to 16 years. The sex, age, severity and course of the disease were comparable between the two groups. The results showed that after treating for 3 and 6 months, the response of patients in group II was higher than that of patients in group I (50% vs 32.1%, P = 0.08 and 65% vs 45.3%, P = 0.059), at 9 and 12 months the response rate of patients in group II and group I did not show significant difference (70.0% vs 71.1%,P = 0.904 and 82.5% vs 80.8%,P = 0.832); at 12 months of treatment, the complete response rate of patients in group II was significantly higher than that of patients in group I (40.0% vs 23.1%,P = 0.08); at 3, 6, 9 months of treatment, the complete response rate of 2 groups showed no obvious difference. The incidence of serum disease, early infection and early mortality did not show statistical difference between two groups. There was no statistical difference in 2 year overall survival rate of two groups.

Western blot was applied to analyze the cell cycle protein (cyclins), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), P53, P21, P27, BCL-2, BCL-XL, Bax, caspase-3/9 and proteins for MAPK signal pathway. The results showed that HNK could inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells in time- and dose dependent ways. HNK arrested HL-60 cells in G0/G1 phase, and S phase cells decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The expression of cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin E and CDK2/4/6 were significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05), the expression of P53 and P21 was significantly upregulated after treating for 24 h with HNK (P < 0.05). After 24 h treatment with HNK, HL-60 cell apoptosis increased significantly with the upregulation of activated caspase-3, -9, BAX expression and the downregulation of BCL-2, BCL-XL expression. The MAPK subfamily, P38 and JNK were not significantly changed, but the expression of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 was significantly downregulated (P < 0.05).

RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression level of SHP-1 and C-kit mRNA in HL-60 cells of the drug-treated group and control group.The methylation specific PCR (MSP) was applied to measure the methylation status of SHP-1 and C-kit genes in HL-60 cells.The results showed that after being treated with 5-aza-CdR, the recovery of SHP-1 gene expression was observed in HL-60 cells in which SHP-1 mRNA originally was not expressed. Meanwhile, the high expression level of C-kit mRNA in HL-60 cells was decreased. When HL-60 cells were treated with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 micromol/L 5-aza-CdR, the demethylation effect was enhanced, the expression of SHP-1 mRNA displayed an ascending tendency, and the expression of C-kit mRNA showed an descending tendency in dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05) . It is concluded that the absence of SHP-1 mRNA expression in HL-60 cells and recovery of expression after treatment with 5-aza-CdR suggest that the hypermethylation of SHP-1 gene relates with pathogenesis of leukemia, and the abnormal increase of C-kit mRNA expression maybe exist in formation of leukemia. The effect of 5-aza-CdR on expression of SHP-1 and C-kit shows dose-dependency, the higher the 5-aza-CdR concentration, the higher the SHP-1 expression and the lower the C-kit expression, moreover, the effect of 5-aza-CdR shows time-dependency in specific concentration.The SHP-1 mRNA expression negatively correlates with C-kit mRNA expression, suggesting that the decrease or absence of SHP-1 expression in leukemia cells weakens the negative regulation on C-kit signaling pathway, thus plays a role in the formation of leukemia.","['Meng, Zhen', 'Li, Ying-Hua', 'Wang, Dong-Mei', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Meng Z', 'Li YH', 'Wang DM', 'Luo JM']","['Department of Hemotology, Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hengshui 053000, Hebei Province, China.

A total of 32 diagnosed adult Ph(+)ALL patients from July 2007 to February 2014 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed and were divided into two groups: imatinib plus chemotherapy group and traditional chemotherapy group. The differences between two groups were analysed in disease-free survival time (DFS), overall survival time (OS) and toxicity. The G banding technigue was used to analyse the karyotype, and the flow cytometry was applyed to detect the immune markers on surface of cells. The results showed that all patients expressed B cell and hematopietic stem/progenitor cell immune markers, out of them 21 patients (65.6%) were with myeloid antigens, 27 patients with simple Ph (+) phenotype and 5 patients with additional chromosome abnormality. The DFS and OS of the imatinib group were statistically longer than those of the traditional chemotherapy group (14.3 +/- 4.7 months vs 10.7 +/- 3.8 months) (P < 0.05) and 22.6 +/- 6.8 months vs 10.7 +/- 3.8 months) (P < 0.05)). There was no significant difference in toxic effects between two groups (P > 0.05)). It is concluded that the all cases of adult Ph(+)ALL are with B cell phenotype and express hematopietic stem/progenitor cell antigen. They often accompanied by expression of myeloid antigens and additonal chromosome abnormality in genetics. The combination of imatinib with chemotherapy can prolong remission time and survival time for patients of non-hematopietic stem cell transplantation on the basis of no notably increasing the toxic effects.","['Chen, Xiao-Yun', 'Zheng, Yong-Liang', 'Chen, Yi-Jian']","['Chen XY', 'Zheng YL', 'Chen YJ']","['Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China; Medical Postgraduated School of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330003, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.

The U937 cells and normal CD34(+) cells were treated with different concentration of EPZ005687 at different time points. The apoptosis rate was determined by Annexin V/PI staining. The cell proliferation and cell cycle was determined using WST-1 assay and 7-AAD assay, respectively. The activity of H3K27 methylation was detected by chemiluminescent immunoassay. The results showed that the EPZ005687 induced an obvious apoptosis of U937 cells. The apoptotic rate was 3.96% +/- 0.79%,5.74% +/- 0.73%,13.34% +/- 1.77% and 25.24% +/- 2.55% in U937 cells treated with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 micromol/L EPZ005687 for 48 hours, respectively. However, EPZ005687 had rare effect on normal bone marrow(NBM) CD34(+) cells. The apoptotic rate was 3.64% +/- 0.62%,4.28% +/- 0.99%,6.18% +/- 1.19% and 7.56% +/- 1.34% after U937 cells were treated with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 micromol/L EPZ005687 for 48 hours, respectively. EPZ005687 inhibited obviously the proliferation of U937 cells but had weak effect on the proliferation of NBMCD34(+) cells. The inhibitory effect of EPZ005687 on U937 cells was time-dependent after treated with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 micromol/L EPZ005687 from 12 to 96 hours. EPZ005687 induced G1 phase blocking (G1%, 64.18% +/- 13.27% vs 49.43% +/- 12.54%) and decreased the percentage of cells in S phase (9.67% +/- 2.61% vs15.26% +/- 5.58%) in U937 cells. However, EPZ005687 had no effect on the cell cycle of NBMCD34(+) cells. In addition, EPZ005687 produced obviously depletion of H3K27 methylation in U937 cells (P < 0.05), but hardly had effect on the H3K27 methylation of NBMCD34(+) cells. It is concluded that the EPZ005687 inhibites proliferation, induces apoptosis and cell cycle blocking in G1 phase in leukemia cells.

The P388 leukemic cells in logarithmic growth phase were taken and injected subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice so as to establish the leukemia-transplanted nude mouse model. The model mice were treated by quercetin, ADR and their combination, and the survival changes of model mice were observed, the hemogram and peripheral blood cell count examination were performed regularly; the cell cycle was detected and the influence of quercetin on cell proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry; the caspase-3 protein expression level was detected by ELISA; the mRNA and protein changes of NF-kappaB, BCL-2, BAX were measured by real-time quantitative flourascence PCR and Western blot respectively. The results indicated that the quercetin and adriamycin could significantly prolong the survival of P388 leukemia nude mice, and their combination displayed significantly prolonged effect. Quercetin and adriamycin alone or in their combination could reduce the ratio of G0/G1 phase in mice, the cell ratio in S phase and G2/M phase increased, and the effects of the combination group were more significant than that of the single agent groups. Quercetin could activate caspase-3 and promote leukemic cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, quercetin could down-regulate the expression of BCL-2 and NF-kappaB gene, and up-regulate the expression of BAX gene. It is concluded that through modulating the expression of apoptosis-related genes, the quercetin can inhibit leukemia cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, and enhance the chemotherapeutic effects of adriamycin.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of miR-155 and relative expression of SHIP1 mRNA in the cells. Cell proliferation was assayed using CCK-8 method. Cell apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of SHIP1, TAKT and pAKT in THP-1 cells were detected by Western blot. The results indicated that compared with THP-1C and THP-1IC, the expression of miR-155 in THP-1I cells was significantly reduced; miR-155 inhibition significantly increased apoptosis rate in THP-1 cells (P < 0.05) ; miR-155 inhibition in THP-1 cells caused no significant alteration in SHIP1 mRNA level but significantly increased its protein content, indicating some post-transcriptional modulations might exist underlying the modulation of miR-155 to SHIP1, the miR-155 caused significantly reduced protein level of pAKT (P < 0.05) without interfering TAKT protein content. It is concluded that the miR-155 inhibition may promote THP-1 cell apoptosis through increasing SHIP1 protein content and impairing its downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

This study was purposed to explore the importance of B progenitor cell (BPC) level in differential diagnosis of hematologic diseases. A total of 664 specimens including 87 specimens from patients with non-malignant hematologic diseases as control and 577 specimens from AL patients in different progressive stage were analyzed. Out of 577 specimens 26 were collected from ALL patients, 261 were collected from B-ALL, 290 were collected from AML. The relation of different clinical status (new diagnosis, remission, relapse), age and degree of leukemia cell involvement with hematopoietic BPC level were analyzed through identification of CD34/CD10/CD19/CD45 antibody combination and quantification of hematopoietic BPC. The results indicated that (1) CD45 distributed from positive to weak positive, and with very low side scatter. The early hematopoietic BPC expressed CD34(+), along with increasing of cell maturation, the CD34 expression gradually disappeared, while CD19 and CD10 showed positive in whole stage of hemaropoietic BPC, and early CD10 highly was expressed. (2) the mean percentage of hematopoietic BPC was 1.36% in control group, 0.60% in T-ALL, 1.39% in B-ALL and 0.80% in AML; the detected rate of hematopoietic BPC in control, T-ALL, B-ALL and AML were 87.4%, 61.5%, 83.5%, 75.9%, respectively; the mean percentage of hematopoietic BPC was 0.37% at new diagnosis, 1.66% in remission and 0.55% in relapse. (3) along with increase of age, the hematopoietic BPC level generally disclined. (4) specimens >5% hematopoietic BPC were mainly found in remission stage of leukemia patients. It is concluded that the hematopoietic BPC are present in malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases. The changes of hematopoietic BPC level correlate with disease state, age and leukemia cell involvement. The increased hematopoietic BPC level are observed most often in the patients with remission after themotherapy. It should be carefully to diagnose and discriminate between malignant and benign cells with double positive CD19 and CD10. Use of multiparametric flow cytometry and optimal antibody combination are important for discriminating hematopoietic BPC from minor residual disease and accuratly diagnosing diseases and evaluating curative effectiveness.","['Xu, Yan-Li', 'Wang, Shun-Qing', 'Mao, Ping', 'DU, Qing-Hua']","['Xu YL', 'Wang SQ', 'Mao P', 'DU QH']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First Municipal Peoples' Hospital, Guangzhou 510180, Guangdong Province, China.

The incidence of SIL-TAL1 rearrangements was analyzed by nest real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 68 patients with T-ALL. Karyotypic analysis was performed by conventional R-banding assay and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). The results showed that SIL-TAL1 rearrangements were identified in 10/26 (38.5%) pediatric and 2/42 (4.8%) adult T-ALL cases, which indicate a pediatric preference for SIL-TAL1 rearrangements in T-ALL. Two different transcripts were detected in 6/12(50%) T-ALL samples. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 6 out of 11 cases (54.5%) and a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 was observed in 4 cases. Array-CGH results of 2 T-ALL cases with SIL-TAL1 rearrangement revealed that this fusion gene was resulted from a cryptic deletion of 1p32, and the overlap region of 6q deletion was 6q14.1-16.3. These cases with SIL-TAL1 fusion had a higher white blood cell (WBC) count and higher serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) than cases without SIL-TAL1 fusion. It is concluded that SIL-TAL1 rearrangements are associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomal 6q, and SIL-TAL1-positive patients are younger than SIL-TAL1-negative patients. In contrast to the cases without SIL-TAL1 fusion, there are many adverse prognostic factors in the cases with SIL-TAL1 fusion, such as higher WBC count and higher LDH levels.","['Wang, Qian', 'Wu, Li-Li', 'Dai, Hai-Ping', 'Ping, Na-Na', 'Wu, Chun-Xiao', 'Pan, Jin-Lan', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Qiu, Hui-Ying', 'Chen, Su-Ning']","['Wang Q', 'Wu LL', 'Dai HP', 'Ping NN', 'Wu CX', 'Pan JL', 'Cen JN', 'Qiu HY', 'Chen SN']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu Province, China.

Seventy-three AML patients were enrolled in this study, the sodium citrate anticoagulated plasma was collected before and after their induction chemotherapy. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate vWF73 (FRETS-vWF73) assay was established to detect the plasma ADAMTS13 activity while vWF antigen level was measured by ELISA. The results showed that the ADAMTS13 activity in newly diagnosed patients with AML before induction therapy was obviously lower than that in normal controls (63.3 +/- 25.5)% vs (105.1 +/- 37.7)(P < 0.01), while the vWF antigen level was higher than that in normal controls (226.6 +/- 127.0)% vs (111.4 +/- 39.7)% (P < 0.01). After standard induction chemotherapy, the ADAMTS13 activity of AML patients in complete remission period was higher than that in AML patients before therapy (P < 0.01), and was not significant difference with that in normal controls; the vWF antigen was significantly lower than that in AML patients before therapy (P < 0.01), but it still was higher than that in controls (P < 0.05). The ADAMTS13 activity in newly diagnosed AML patients complicated with infection before therapy was obviously lower than that in AML patients without infection (52.2 +/- 20.6)% vs (73.9 +/- 24.7)% (P < 0.01), while the vWF antigen level was significantly higher than that in AML patients without infection (262.2 +/- 135.7)% vs (193.8 +/- 110.2)% (P < 0.05).

However, no studies have specifically investigated the role of miR-21 in AMLs. In this study we analyzed the expression of miR-21 and of its target PDCD4 (Programmed Cell Death 4) during normal hematopoietic differentiation and in AMLs. Our results showed that: (i) miR-21 expression is strongly up-modulated during normal granulo/monocytic differentiation, while PDCD4 protein level is concomitantly downmodulated; (ii) miR-21 is frequently overexpressed in AML blasts, in association with a marked PDCD4 protein downmodulation; (iii) miR-21 expression level is particularly elevated in NPM1mutant AMLs.

HLA-E-peptide complex acts as a ligand for natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes playing a dual role in natural and acquired immune responses. The difference in expression levels between HLA-E alleles was suggested to have impact on transplantation outcome. The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical effect of HLA-E alleles on transplantation in a group of Egyptian patients. HLA-E genotyping was analyzed in eighty-eight recipients of stem cell transplantation using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). HLA-E*01:03 allele showed a trend towards lower cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years compared to homozygous HLA-E*01:01 genotype (8% versus 21.5%, p=0.09, HR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.91-1.69). HLA-E was the only factor showing near significant association with relapse incidence. HLA-E polymorphism did not affect the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV at 100 days, the 2-year cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD, transplant related mortality (TRM) or overall survival (OS). CONCLUSION: the suggested association of HLA-E polymorphism with reduced risk of relapse needs verification in a larger cohort. However, its proposed role in GVL helps better understanding of alloreactivity of T cells and NK cells and their implication in immunotherapy post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Mossallam, Ghada I', 'Fattah, Raafat Abdel', 'El-Haddad, Alaa', 'Mahmoud, Hossam K']","['Mossallam GI', 'Fattah RA', 'El-Haddad A', 'Mahmoud HK']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory Unit, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.

In this study, our objective was to investigate the metabolic basis of resistance to ritonavir and to determine the utility of cotreatment with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor metformin to target compensatory metabolism. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined combination indices for ritonavir and metformin, impact on myeloma cell lines, patient samples, and myeloma xenograft growth. Additional evaluation in breast, melanoma, and ovarian cancer cell lines was also performed. Signaling connected to suppression of the prosurvival BCL-2 family member MCL-1 was evaluated in multiple myeloma cell lines and tumor lysates. Reliance on oxidative metabolism was determined by evaluation of oxygen consumption, and dependence on glutamine was assessed by estimation of viability upon metabolite withdrawal in the context of specific metabolic perturbations. RESULTS: Ritonavir-treated multiple myeloma cells exhibited increased reliance on glutamine metabolism. Ritonavir sensitized multiple myeloma cells to metformin, effectively eliciting cytotoxicity both in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model of multiple myeloma and in breast, ovarian, and melanoma cancer cell lines. Ritonavir and metformin effectively suppressed AKT and mTORC1 phosphorylation and prosurvival BCL-2 family member MCL-1 expression in multiple myeloma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: FDA-approved ritonavir and metformin effectively target multiple myeloma cell metabolism to elicit cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma. Our studies warrant further investigation into repurposing ritonavir and metformin to target the metabolic plasticity of myeloma to more broadly target myeloma heterogeneity and prevent the reemergence of chemoresistant aggressive multiple myeloma.","['Dalva-Aydemir, Sevim', 'Bajpai, Richa', 'Martinez, Maylyn', 'Adekola, Kehinde U A', 'Kandela, Irawati', 'Wei, Changyong', 'Singhal, Seema', 'Koblinski, Jennifer E', 'Raje, Noopur S', 'Rosen, Steven T', 'Shanmugam, Mala']","['Dalva-Aydemir S', 'Bajpai R', 'Martinez M', 'Adekola KU', 'Kandela I', 'Wei C', 'Singhal S', 'Koblinski JE', 'Raje NS', 'Rosen ST', 'Shanmugam M']","['Robert H.

METHODS: Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer cohort, we measured prediagnostic plasma sCD23 for 179 individuals who eventually were diagnosed with CLL and an equal number of matched control subjects who remained free of cancer. RESULTS: In a very large proportion of CLL patients' plasma sCD23 was clearly elevated 7 or more years before diagnosis. Considering sCD23 as a disease predictor, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-1.00] for CLL diagnosed within 0.1 to 2.7 years after blood measurement, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95) for diagnosis within 2.8 to 7.3 years, and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.65-0.86) for CLL diagnosed between 7.4 and 12.5 years. Even at a 7.4-year and longer time interval, elevated plasma sCD23 could predict a later clinical diagnosis of CLL with 100% specificity at >45% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide unique documentation for the very long latency times during which measurable B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder exists before the clinical manifestation of CLL. IMPACT: Our findings have relevance for the interpretation of prospective epidemiologic studies on the causes of CLL in terms of reverse causation bias. The lag times indicate a time frame within which an early detection of CLL would be theoretically possible. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(3); 538-45.

Univariate analysis revealed that ALC-22/ALC-0 ratio <10% was significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR)=12.24, P=0.0014) and event-free survival (EFS) (HR=3.3, P=0.0046).

A Spearman correlation test showed that CD3+ T cells had a negative correlation with ALC-0 (r=-0.7204, P<0.0001) and a positive correlation with ALC-22 (r=0.5061, P=0.0071). These data suggest that ALC-22/ALC-0 ratio may serve as a more effective biomarker to predict survival in pediatric B-ALL and ALC is mainly associated with CD3+ T cells.","['Cheng, Yuping', 'Luo, Zebin', 'Yang, Shilong', 'Jia, Ming', 'Zhao, Haizhao', 'Xu, Weiqun', 'Tang, Yongmin']","['Cheng Y', 'Luo Z', 'Yang S', 'Jia M', 'Zhao H', 'Xu W', 'Tang Y']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, PR China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, PR China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, PR China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, PR China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, PR China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, PR China."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, PR China.

However, co-culture of AML cells with MSC significantly protected leukemic blasts from NK cell mediated lysis, mainly in a specific manner requiring cell-to-cell contact with supportive MSC. These data imply a relevant but unequivocal role of hypoxia and MSC the immune response against AML blasts.","['Vasold, Jochen', 'Wagner, Michaela', 'Drolle, Heidrun', 'Deniffel, Christian', 'Kutt, Alexander', 'Oostendorp, Robert', 'Sironi, Silvia', 'Rieger, Christina', 'Fiegl, Michael']","['Vasold J', 'Wagner M', 'Drolle H', 'Deniffel C', 'Kutt A', 'Oostendorp R', 'Sironi S', 'Rieger C', 'Fiegl M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany.

BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is known to cause hemorrhagic cystitis, but there is also evidence of BKV shedding in stool and its association with gastrointestinal disease. We report putative association of BKPyV replication with high plasma viral loads in a pediatric HSCT patient developing hemorrhagic cystitis and severe gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating intensive care. The observation was based on chart review and analysis of BKPyV DNA loads in plasma and urine as well as retrospective BKPyV-specific IgM and IgG measurements in weekly samples until three months post-transplant. The gastrointestinal bleeding was observed after a >100-fold increase in the plasma BKPyV loads and the start of hemorrhagic cystitis. The BKPyV-specific antibody response indicated past infection prior to transplantation, but increasing IgG titers were seen following BKPyV replication. The gastrointestinal biopsies were taken at a late stage of the episode and were no longer informative of BK polyomavirus involvement. In conclusion, gastrointestinal complications with bleeding are a significant problem after allogeneic HSCT to which viral infections including BKPyV may contribute.","['Koskenvuo, M', 'Lautenschlager, I', 'Kardas, P', 'Auvinen, E', 'Mannonen, L', 'Huttunen, P', 'Taskinen, M', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Hirsch, H H']","['Koskenvuo M', 'Lautenschlager I', 'Kardas P', 'Auvinen E', 'Mannonen L', 'Huttunen P', 'Taskinen M', 'Vettenranta K', 'Hirsch HH']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.

However, the effect of TAIII on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. Here, the molecular mechanism by which TAIII-induced apoptosis affects human AML cells was investigated. The results showed that TAIII significantly inhibited cell proliferation of four AML cell lines (MV4-11, U937, THP-1, and HL-60). Furthermore, TAIII induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells through caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activations and PARP cleavage in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, Western blot analysis also showed that TAIII increased phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of JNK1/2 by specific inhibitors significantly abolished the TAIII-induced activation of the caspase-8. Taken together, our results suggest that TAIII induces HL-60 cell apoptosis through JNK1/2 pathways and could serve as a potential additional chemotherapeutic agent for treating AML.","['Huang, Hsin-Lien', 'Chiang, Whei-Ling', 'Hsiao, Pei-Ching', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien', 'Chen, Hui-Yu', 'Weng, Wei-Chun', 'Hsieh, Ming-Ju', 'Yang, Shun-Fa']","['Huang HL', 'Chiang WL', 'Hsiao PC', 'Chien MH', 'Chen HY', 'Weng WC', 'Hsieh MJ', 'Yang SF']","['Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, 110, Section 1, Chien-Kuo N.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been reported as a curative treatment modality for ATL. However, there are no reports comparing chemotherapy alone with allo-HSCT in ATL. In this report, we retrospectively analyzed data for patients treated with (n = 29, median age 55 years) or without allo-HSCT (n = 37, median age 58 years) for ATL in Kagoshima University Hospital, located in one of the most endemic areas of human T cell lymphotropic leukemia virus type 1 infection. Forty patients (61%) started coordination for allo-HSCT. Ten patients (34.4%) received allo-HSCT while in complete remission (CR), whereas the others were not in CR. Twenty-five patients (86.2%) received reduced-intensity conditioning, and the others received myeloablative conditioning. With a median follow-up period for survivors of 41 months (range, 5 to 125 months), the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate from first chemotherapy for all patients (with or without allo-HSCT) was 35.2%. The 3-year OS from first chemotherapy for patients who received allo-HSCT or only chemotherapy was 44.9% and 27.7%, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that high serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels (>/= 2000 U/mL) just before the conditioning regimen and progressive disease (PD) status at HSCT (according to Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study 0907 criteria) were significant risk factors for OS in the allo-HSCT group. Multivariate analyses revealed that PD status was a significant risk factor for OS in the allo-HSCT group. In the chemotherapy-only group, the 3-year OS rate was 61.5% (95% CI, 30.8% to 81.8%) in patients with serum sIL-2R levels < 2000 U/mL for > 3 months. In contrast, the 3-year OS rate was 5.7% (95% CI, .4% to 22.4%) in patients who did not achieve serum sIL-2R levels < 2000 U/mL for >3 months. Our single-center cohort experience indicates that chemosensitivity is the most important prognostic factor for OS in ATL patients and the use of allo-HSCT is limited in chemorefractory patients with aggressive ATL disease. In the chemosensitive patients, allo-HSCT demonstrated a tendency toward better OS. Further clinical studies are warranted to determine optimal treatments for patients who are less sensitive to conventional chemotherapy.","['Kawada, Hideaki', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Nakamura, Daisuke', 'Arai, Akihiko', 'Hayashida, Maiko', 'Kamada, Yuhei', 'Maekawa, Kenichi', 'Fujino, Satoshi', 'Arima, Mamiko', 'Arima, Naosuke', 'Tabuchi, Tomohisa', 'Inoue, Hirosaka', 'Hamda, Heiichiro', 'Suzuki, Shinsuke', 'Matsushita, Kakushi', 'Arima, Naomichi']","['Kawada H', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Nakamura D', 'Arai A', 'Hayashida M', 'Kamada Y', 'Maekawa K', 'Fujino S', 'Arima M', 'Arima N', 'Tabuchi T', 'Inoue H', 'Hamda H', 'Suzuki S', 'Matsushita K', 'Arima N']","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan; Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.

METHODS: Motor behavior was assessed using Rotarod and Platform Hang tests; neurons in the corticospinal and rubrospinal systems were labeled with FG, NPCs were immustained with nestin-FITC conjugate. The numbers of FG-labeled neurons and NPCs were estimated, and the correlation between FG-labeled neurons and NPCs was assessed. RESULTS: Mice in the SCI group showed negligible recovery of locomotor behavior; in contrast, mice in the LIF group showed a statically significant improvement. Both FG-labeled neurons and NPCs were significantly increased in the LIF group compared to the SCI group, and this increase in FG-labeled neurons and NPCs showed a clear association above the lesion level. CONCLUSIONS: LIF could promote locomotive behaviors in mice post-SCI by encouraging the proliferation of NPCs; LIF may in fact be a potential cytokine for the induction of NPCs post-SCI.","['Li, Yubo', 'Zang, Dawei']","['Li Y', 'Zang D']","['Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300192, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141226,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4277544,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0116031 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-34882 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 26;9(12):e116031. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116031. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Locomotion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neural Stem Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/*cytology/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy']",['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Replication factor C3 (RFC3) is required for chromatin loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) which is a sliding clamp platform for recruiting numerous proteins in the DNA metabolism. CREB1 expression, which was activated by E2F, was coupled with RFC3 expression during the G1/S progression in the KG-1 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line. There was also a direct correlation between the expression of RFC3 and CREB1 in human AML cell lines as well as in the AML cells from the patients. CREB interacted directly with the CRE site in RFC3 promoter region. CREB-knockdown inhibited primarily G1/S cell cycle transition by decreasing the expression of RFC3 as well as PCNA loading onto the chromatin. Exogenous expression of RFC3 was sufficient to rescue the impaired G1/S progression and PCNA chromatin loading caused by CREB knockdown. These studies suggest that RFC3 may have a role in neoplastic myelopoiesis by promoting the G1/S progression and its expression is regulated by CREB.","['Chae, H-D', 'Mitton, B', 'Lacayo, N J', 'Sakamoto, K M']","['Chae HD', 'Mitton B', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141226,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC4456282,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/12/27 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014350 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.350 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1379-89. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.350.

They participate in pathways fundamental to B-cell development like B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling, B-cell migration/adhesion, cell-cell interactions in immune niches, and the production and class-switching of immunoglobulins. miRNAs influence B-cell maturation, generation of pre-, marginal zone, follicular, B1, plasma and memory B cells. In this review, we discuss miRNAs with essential functions in malignant B-cell development (such as miR-150, miR-155, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-17-92 and miR-15-16). We also put these miRNAs in the context of normal B-cell differentiation, as this is intimately connected to neoplastic B-cell development. We review miRNAs' role in the most common B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We focus on miR-contribution to the regulation of important signalling pathways (such as NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT and TGF-beta), BCR signalling and its modulators (such as PTEN, SHIP-1, ZAP-70, GAB1 and BTK), anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins (such as BCL2, MCL1, TCL1, BIM, p53 and SIRT1) and transcription factors (such as MYC, MYB, PU.1, FOXP1 and BCL6). We also discuss the association of miRNAs' expression levels with the patients' survival and response to therapy, summarizing their potential use as predictive and prognostic markers. Importantly, the targeting of miRNAs (like use of anti-miR-155 or miR-34a mimic) could provide a novel therapeutic approach as evidenced by tumour regression in xenograft mouse models and initial promising data from clinical trials.","['Musilova, K', 'Mraz, M']","['Musilova K', 'Mraz M']","['Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', '1] Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic [2] Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic [3] Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141226,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/12/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014351 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.351 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1004-17. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.351.

Autophagy serves as a vehicle for cells to respond to various stressors including genomic, hypoxic and nutrient stress, and to oppose mechanisms of 'programmed' cell death. Here, we review not only mechanisms of cell death and cell survival but also the early successes in applying autophagy inhibition strategies in solid tumors using the only currently available clinical inhibitor, oral hydroxychloroquine. In acute leukemia, currently available chemotherapy drugs promote cell death and demonstrate clinical benefit, but relapse and subsequent chemotherapy resistance is common. Increasing preclinical data suggest that autophagy is active in leukemia as a means of promoting cell survival in response to chemotherapy. We propose coupling autophagy inhibition strategies with current cytotoxic chemotherapy and discuss synergistic combinations of available anti-leukemic therapies with autophagy inhibition. Furthermore, novel autophagy inhibitors are in development and promise to provide new therapeutic opportunities for patients with leukemia.","['Sehgal, A R', 'Konig, H', 'Johnson, D E', 'Tang, D', 'Amaravadi, R K', 'Boyiadzis, M', 'Lotze, M T']","['Sehgal AR', 'Konig H', 'Johnson DE', 'Tang D', 'Amaravadi RK', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Lotze MT']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20141126,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC4825874,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/12/27 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014349 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.349 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Mar;29(3):517-25. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.349.

Lastly, we explored advice for future patients provided by younger and older AML survivors on how to survive the period of intensive chemotherapy (IC). We conducted a prospective qualitative study with 26 participants (14 younger (age 18-59), 12 older (age 60 or older)) who underwent IC. Data were analyzed using Grounded Theory. Both younger and older survivors reported persistent health issues and functional limitations; however, older participants were more satisfied with their post-treatment function and quality of life.

Provision of written educational material was highlighted by younger participants. Frequent travel to hospital and long waiting times were identified as undesirable. In conclusion, although we observed that many survivorship issues during and shortly after a diagnosis are similar among younger and older survivors, some issues differ by age, pointing out the need for customized approaches.","['Ghodraty-Jabloo, Vida', 'Alibhai, Shabbir M H', 'Breunis, Henriette', 'Puts, Martine T E']","['Ghodraty-Jabloo V', 'Alibhai SM', 'Breunis H', 'Puts MT']","['Lawrence S.

All patients received a median number of 4 courses of Aza (range, 4 to 14) and DLI were administered to 105 patients (68%; median number of DLI, 2; range, 1 to 7). Complete and partial remission rates were 27% and 6%, respectively, resulting in an overall response rate of 33%. Multivariate analysis identified molecular-only relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 9.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 43.5; P = .004) and diagnosis of MDS (HR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 12.2; P = .011) as predictors for complete remission. Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 29% +/- 4%. Molecular-only relapse (HR, .14; 95% CI, .03 to .59; P = .007), diagnosis of MDS (HR, .33; 95% CI, .16 to .67; P = .002), and bone marrow blasts <13% (HR, .54; 95% CI, .32 to .91; P = .021) were associated with better OS. Accordingly, 2-year OS rate was higher in MDS patients (66% +/- 10%, P = .001) and correlated with disease burden in patients with AML. In summary, Aza and DLI is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with relapse after allo-HSCT, in particular those with MDS or AML and low disease burden. The latter finding emphasizes the importance of stringent disease monitoring and early intervention.","['Schroeder, Thomas', 'Rachlis, Elena', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Klein, Stefan', 'Steckel, Nina Kristin', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'Czibere, Akos', 'Nachtkamp, Kathrin', 'Dienst, Ariane', 'Kondakci, Mustafa', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Uharek, Lutz', 'Luft, Thomas', 'Fenk, Roland', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Kobbe, Guido']","['Schroeder T', 'Rachlis E', 'Bug G', 'Stelljes M', 'Klein S', 'Steckel NK', 'Wolf D', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Czibere A', 'Nachtkamp K', 'Dienst A', 'Kondakci M', 'Stadler M', 'Platzbecker U', 'Uharek L', 'Luft T', 'Fenk R', 'Germing U', 'Bornhauser M', 'Kroger N', 'Beelen DW', 'Haas R', 'Kobbe G']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.

We retrospectively compared the outcomes of male patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from female donors (F-M) (174 patients) versus other gender combinations (667 patients). Median age was 50 years (range, 18 to 74 years). For the whole group, the 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in F-M group (34.1% versus 41.3%, P = .044), whereas nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was higher (23.2% versus 15.7%, P = .004). For patients younger than 50 years beyond first complete remission, the F-M group was associated with lower relapse rate (42.5% versus 55.2%, P = .045) whereas NRM was not significantly different (35.8% versus 25.5%, P = .141). Although survival was not significantly improved, transplantation from a female donor for male recipient was associated with a lower relapse rate. When relapse is the most common concern for treatment failure, especially for younger patients, a female donor for a male recipient might be beneficial to decrease relapse rate after transplantation. Future studies are needed to explore how the H-Y mismatch may improve survival after transplantation.","['Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Di Stasi, Antonio', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Adekola, Kehinde', 'Popat, Uday', 'Oran, Betul', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Andersson, Borje S', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Ciurea, Stefan O']","['Kongtim P', 'Di Stasi A', 'Rondon G', 'Chen J', 'Adekola K', 'Popat U', 'Oran B', 'Kebriaei P', 'Andersson BS', 'Champlin RE', 'Ciurea SO']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

Despite its good performance, MI cannot separate the direct regulations from indirect ones among genes. Although the conditional mutual information (CMI) is able to identify the direct regulations, it generally underestimates the regulation strength, i.e. it may result in false negatives when inferring gene regulations. In this work, to overcome the problems, we propose a novel concept, namely conditional mutual inclusive information (CMI2), to describe the regulations between genes. Furthermore, with CMI2, we develop a new approach, namely CMI2NI (CMI2-based network inference), for reverse-engineering GRNs. In CMI2NI, CMI2 is used to quantify the mutual information between two genes given a third one through calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the postulated distributions of including and excluding the edge between the two genes. The benchmark results on the GRNs from DREAM challenge as well as the SOS DNA repair network in Escherichia coli demonstrate the superior performance of CMI2NI.

Therapeutic approaches for HTLV-1-related pathologies are limited. The labdane diterpene myriadenolide (AMY) is a natural product that exhibit biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity as reported for HIV and herpesvirus. RESULTS: We demonstrated that this natural product was able to inhibit the expression of gag-pol mRNA and substantially reduced the expression of the structural proteins p19 and gp46. Comparison of treated and untreated cells shows that AMY alters both the morphology and the release of viral particles. The Atomic Force Microscopy assay showed that the AMY treatment reduced the number of particles on the cell surface by 47%. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the labdane diterpene myriadenolide reduced the expression of the structural proteins and the budding of viral particles, besides induces altered morphogenesis of HTLV-1, conferring on AMY a new antiviral activity that may be useful for the development of new compounds with specific anti-HTLV-1 activity.","['Martins, Camila Pacheco Silveira', 'Gomes, Orlando Abreu', 'Martins, Marina Lobato', 'de Carvalho, Luciana Debortoli', 'de Souza, Jaqueline Gontijo', 'Da Fonseca, Flavio Guimaraes', 'dos Santos, Rodrigo Goncalves Silva', 'Andrade, Margareth Spangler', 'Zani, Carlos Leomar', 'de Souza-Fagundes, Elaine Maria', 'Barbosa-Stancioli, Edel Figueiredo']","['Martins CP', 'Gomes OA', 'Martins ML', 'de Carvalho LD', 'de Souza JG', 'Da Fonseca FG', 'dos Santos RG', 'Andrade MS', 'Zani CL', 'de Souza-Fagundes EM', 'Barbosa-Stancioli EF']","['Laboratorio de Virologia Basica e Aplicada (LVBA), Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Antonio Carlos, 6627, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. cpsmartins@yahoo.com.br.', 'Interdisciplinary HTLV Research Group - GIPH - Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. cpsmartins@yahoo.com.br.', 'Nucleo de Ciencias Exatas - FACE - Universidade FUMEC, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. gomes.oa@gmail.com.', 'Interdisciplinary HTLV Research Group - GIPH - Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. marina.martins@hemominas.mg.gov.br.', 'Servico de Pesquisa, Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. marina.martins@hemominas.mg.gov.br.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia Basica e Aplicada (LVBA), Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Antonio Carlos, 6627, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. ludebor.carvalho39@gmail.com.', 'Interdisciplinary HTLV Research Group - GIPH - Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. ludebor.carvalho39@gmail.com.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia Basica e Aplicada (LVBA), Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Antonio Carlos, 6627, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. jgontijos@yahoo.com.br.', 'Interdisciplinary HTLV Research Group - GIPH - Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. jgontijos@yahoo.com.br.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia Basica e Aplicada (LVBA), Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Antonio Carlos, 6627, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. fdafonseca@icb.ufmg.br.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia Basica e Aplicada (LVBA), Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Antonio Carlos, 6627, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. rodrigoebio@gmail.com.', 'Interdisciplinary HTLV Research Group - GIPH - Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. rodrigoebio@gmail.com.', 'Centro Tecnologico SENAI CETEC, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. margareth.andrade@fiemg.com.br.', 'Centro de Pesquisas Rene Rachou, FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. zani@cpqrr.fiocruz.br.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia e Biofisica, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. elainefagundes@gmail.com.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia Basica e Aplicada (LVBA), Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Antonio Carlos, 6627, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. edelfb@icb.ufmg.br.', 'Interdisciplinary HTLV Research Group - GIPH - Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. edelfb@icb.ufmg.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,England,BMC Microbiol,BMC microbiology,100966981,PMC4302425,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/12/26 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12866-014-0331-2 [doi]', 's12866-014-0331-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Microbiol. 2014 Dec 24;14:331. doi: 10.1186/s12866-014-0331-2.,,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Factors/pharmacology', 'Biological Products/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Morphogenesis/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (myriadenolide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information on the prevalence of risk factors in the childhood population is limited. SETIL is a population based case-control study on childhood leukaemia, conducted with two companion studies on non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and neuroblastoma. The study relies on questionnaire interviews and 50 Hz magnetic field (ELF-MF) indoor measurements. This paper discusses the SETIL study design and includes descriptive information. METHODS: The study was carried out in 14 Italian regions (78.3% of Italian population aged 0-10). It included leukaemia, NHL and neuroblastoma cases incident in 0-10 year olds in 1998-2001, registered by the Italian Association of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (AIEOP) (accrual over 95% of estimated incidence). Two controls for each leukaemia case were randomly sampled from the Local Health Authorities rolls, matched by gender, birthdate and residence. The same controls were used in NHL and neuroblastoma studies. Parents were interviewed at home on: physical agents (ELF-MF and ionizing radiation), chemicals (smoking, solvents, traffic, insecticides), occupation, medical and personal history of children and parents, infectious diseases, immunizations and associated factors. Occupational exposure was collected using job specific modules. ELF-MF was measured in the main rooms (spot measurement) and close to child's bed (48 hours measurement). RESULTS: The study included: 683 leukaemia cases (87% ALL, 13% AnLL), 97 NHL, 155 neuroblastomas, and 1044 controls. CONCLUSIONS: SETIL represents a data source on exposure of Italian children to a broad array of potential carcinogenic factors.","['Magnani, Corrado', 'Mattioli, Stefano', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Ranucci, Alessandra', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Salvan, Alberto', 'Bisanti, Luigi', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Zambon, Paola', 'Cannizzaro, Santina', 'Gafa, Lorenzo', 'Luzzatto, Lia Lidia', 'Benvenuti, Alessandra', 'Michelozzi, Paola', 'Kirchmayer, Ursula', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Biddau, Pierfranco', 'Galassi, Claudia', 'Celentano, Egidio', 'Guarino, Erni', 'Assennato, Giorgio', 'de Nichilo, Gigliola', 'Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Bocchini, Vittorio', 'Pannelli, Franco', 'Mosciatti, Paola', 'Minelli, Liliana', 'Chiavarini, Manuela', 'Cuttini, Marina', 'Casotto, Veronica', 'Torregrossa, Maria Valeria', 'Valenti, Rosalia Maria', 'Forastiere, Francesco', 'Haupt, Riccardo', 'Lagorio, Susanna', 'Risica, Serena', 'Polichetti, Alessandro']","['Magnani C', 'Mattioli S', 'Miligi L', 'Ranucci A', 'Rondelli R', 'Salvan A', 'Bisanti L', 'Masera G', 'Rizzari C', 'Zambon P', 'Cannizzaro S', 'Gafa L', 'Luzzatto LL', 'Benvenuti A', 'Michelozzi P', 'Kirchmayer U', 'Cocco P', 'Biddau P', 'Galassi C', 'Celentano E', 'Guarino E', 'Assennato G', 'de Nichilo G', 'Merlo DF', 'Bocchini V', 'Pannelli F', 'Mosciatti P', 'Minelli L', 'Chiavarini M', 'Cuttini M', 'Casotto V', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Valenti RM', 'Forastiere F', 'Haupt R', 'Lagorio S', 'Risica S', 'Polichetti A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,England,Ital J Pediatr,Italian journal of pediatrics,101510759,PMC4310183,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2014/12/26 06:00'],"['2014/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['s13052-014-0103-5 [pii]', '10.1186/s13052-014-0103-5 [doi]']",epublish,Ital J Pediatr. 2014 Dec 24;40:103. doi: 10.1186/s13052-014-0103-5.,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different parts of this plant are used to treat several diseases in Cameroon. The aim of this study is to determine the in vitro anti-proliferative effects and apoptotic events of A. muricata extracts on HL-60 cells as well as to quantify its phenols content. METHODS: The cell viability was measured by using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay while the changes in morphology of HL-60 cells, membrane mitochondrial potential (MMP) and the cell cycle were used for assessment apoptosis induction. RESULTS: The results show that the concentration of phenols, flavonoids and flavonols in the extracts varied depending on the part of the plant. All the extracts tested inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a concentration dependent manner with IC50 varied from 6-49 mug/mL. The growth inhibition of the cells by extracts was associated with the disruption of MMP, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the G0/G1 cell arrest. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the extracts from A. muricata have strong antiproliferation potential and can induce apoptosis through loss of MMP and G0/G1 phase cell arrest.","['Pieme, Constant Anatole', 'Kumar, Santosh Guru', 'Dongmo, Mireille Sylviane', 'Moukette, Bruno Moukette', 'Boyoum, Fabrice Fekam', 'Ngogang, Jeanne Yonkeu', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar']","['Pieme CA', 'Kumar SG', 'Dongmo MS', 'Moukette BM', 'Boyoum FF', 'Ngogang JY', 'Saxena AK']","['Department of Physiological Sciences and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde I, PO Box 1364, Yaounde, Cameroon. apieme@yahoo.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,PMC4324658,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2014/12/26 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-14-516 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-14-516 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2014 Dec 24;14:516. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-14-516.,,IM,"['Africa', 'Annona/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/analysis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Phenols/analysis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, potentiating effect of EGCG on TRAIL-induced apoptosis human renal carcinoma cell line 786-O which is relatively resistant to TRAIL was examined, and the possible mechanism was investigated. Here, we show that co-treatment with EGCG and TRAIL induced significantly more profound apoptosis in 786-O cells. Treatment of 786-O cells with EGCG and TRAIL downregulated c-FLIP, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 proteins in a caspase-dependent pathway. Moreover, we found that pretreatment with NAC markedly inhibited the expression levels of c-FLIP, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 downregulated by the combinatory treatment, suggesting that the regulating effect of EGCG on these above apoptosis-relevant molecules was partially mediated by generation of ROS. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that EGCG sensitizes human 786-O renal cell carcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by downregulation of c-FLIP, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2.","['Wei, Ruojing', 'Zhu, Guodong', 'Jia, Ning', 'Yang, Wenzeng']","['Wei R', 'Zhu G', 'Jia N', 'Yang W']","['The Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Baoding, China. drruojingwei@163.com.', ""The First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", 'The Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Baoding, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Baoding, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate', 'Renal cell carcinoma', 'Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)']",2014/12/30 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2014/12/26 06:00'],"['2014/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12013-014-0428-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12013-014-0428-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2015 May;72(1):157-64. doi: 10.1007/s12013-014-0428-0.,,IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']","['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: To address this question, we used qPCR to analyze mRNA expression of HOXA and HOXB genes in bone marrow (BM) samples of 46 patients with AML and sorted subpopulations of healthy BM cells. These various stages of myeloid differentiation represent matched counterparts of morphological subgroups of AML. To further study the transcriptional alterations of HOX genes in hematopoiesis, we also analyzed gene expression of epigenetic modifiers in the subpopluations of healthy BM and leukemic cells. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering divided the AMLs into five clusters characterized by the presence of prevalent molecular genetic aberrations. Notably, the impact of genotype on HOX gene expression was significantly more pronounced than that of the differentiation stage of the blasts. This driving role of molecular aberrations was best exemplified by the repressive effect of the PML-RARa fusion gene on HOX gene expression, regardless of the presence of the FLT3/ITD mutation. Furthermore, HOX gene expression was positively correlated with mRNA levels of histone demethylases (JMJD3 and UTX) and negatively correlated with gene expression of DNA methyltranferases. No such relationships were observed in subpopulations of healthy BM cells. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that specific molecular genetic aberrations, rather than differentiation per se, underlie the observed differences in HOX gene expression in AML. Moreover, the observed correlations between epigenetic modifiers and HOX expression that are specific to malignant hematopoiesis, suggest their potential causal relationships.","['Skvarova Kramarzova, Karolina', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Rejlova, Katerina', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Fornerod, Maarten', 'Drabkin, Harry A', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan', 'Starkova, Julia']","['Skvarova Kramarzova K', 'Fiser K', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Rejlova K', 'Zaliova M', 'Fornerod M', 'Drabkin HA', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Stary J', 'Trka J', 'Starkova J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC4310032,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/12/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0094-0 [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0094-0 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Dec 24;7:94. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0094-0.,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome']",['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific groups rather than single members of the protein family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as membrane spanning Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic helicases might mediate sensing of replication intermediates of a specific virus species. TLR7 mediates host sensing of retroviruses and could significantly influence retrovirus-specific antibody responses. However, the origin of efficient cell-mediated immunity towards retroviruses is unknown. Double-stranded RNA intermediates produced during retroviral replication are good candidates for immune stimulatory viral products. Thus, we considered TLR3 as primer of cell-mediated immunity against retroviruses in vivo. RESULTS: Infection of mice deficient in TLR3 (TLR3(-/-)) with Friend retrovirus (FV) complex revealed higher viral loads during acute retroviral infection compared to wild type mice. TLR3(-/-) mice exhibited significantly lower expression levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes like Pkr or Ifi44, as well as reduced numbers of activated myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) (CD86(+) and MHC-II(+)). DCs generated from FV-infected TLR3(-/-) mice were less capable of priming virus-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation. Moreover, cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells as well as CD8(+) T cells were reduced in vitro and in vivo, respectively, in FV-infected TLR3(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: TLR3 mediates antiretroviral cytotoxic NK cell and CD8(+) T cell activity in vivo. Our findings qualify TLR3 as target of immune therapy against retroviral infections.","['Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Francois, Sandra', 'Sigmund, Anna M', 'Harper, Michael S', 'Barrett, Bradley S', 'Kirchning, Carsten J', 'Lu, Mengji', 'Santiago, Mario L', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Gibbert K', 'Francois S', 'Sigmund AM', 'Harper MS', 'Barrett BS', 'Kirchning CJ', 'Lu M', 'Santiago ML', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology of the University Hospital in Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.

Lipotoxicity can be induced by hyperinsulinemia/nutrient overload, cationic amphiphilic drugs (CAD), and innate immunological stimuli, all of which are stimuli relevant to mast cell physiology. Hyper-accumulation of mast cell lipid bodies in response to hyperinsulinemia has been documented, but lipotoxicity in response to CAD or innate immunologic stimuli has not been analysed comparatively. Moreover, gaps in our understanding of this steatosis remain, specifically as to whether hyperinsulinemia-driven steatosis in these cells attains lipotoxic levels or is accompanied by phospholipidosis. To compare endocrine, pharmacological, and innate immunological stimuli for their ability to induce steatosis and phospholipidosis in a rat basophilic leukemia mast cell model (RBL2H3), differential fluorescence microscopy staining and quantitation of phospholipidosis and steatosis in the RBL2H3 cell line was examined. The three classes of stimuli differentially induced phospholipidosis and steatosis. PPARgamma up-regulation was not uniformly associated with the expansion of the lipid body population. Fluorescence imaging of lipid-enriched structures generated in response to lipotoxic cationic amphiphilic drugs, chronic insulin exposure, and TLR2/4 ligands revealed differential staining patterns when visualized using lipophilic dyes. It is concluded that lipotoxicity-inducing pathways in this model mast cell system are diverse, and include steatotic responses to an endocrine stimulus, as well as phospholipidosis responses to cationic lipophilic drugs not previously described in this cell type.","['Maaetoft-Udsen, Kristina', 'Greineisen, William E', 'Aldan, Johnny Tudela', 'Magaoay, Hazelle', 'Ligohr, Cheryll', 'Shimoda, Lori M N', 'Sung, Carl', 'Turner, Helen']","['Maaetoft-Udsen K', 'Greineisen WE', 'Aldan JT', 'Magaoay H', 'Ligohr C', 'Shimoda LM', 'Sung C', 'Turner H']","['Laboratory of Immunology and Signal Transduction, Chaminade University , Honolulu, HI , USA .']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141224,England,J Immunotoxicol,Journal of immunotoxicology,101201960,PMC4755781,['NOTNLM'],"['Lipotoxicity', 'mast cells', 'phospholipidosis', 'steatosis']",2014/12/30 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/1547691X.2014.990655 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunotoxicol. 2015;12(4):385-94. doi: 10.3109/1547691X.2014.990655.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 163 adults from 1996 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Potential associations between use of radiation and outcome were investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median survival time was 3.8 months after RT. Common presenting symptoms were headache in 79 patients (49%), cranial nerve VII deficit in 46 (28%), and cranial nerve II deficit in 44 (27%). RT was delivered to the base of skull in 48 patients (29%), to the whole brain (WB) in 67 (41%), and to the craniospinal axis (CS) in 48 (29%). Among 149 patients with a total of 233 deficits, resolution was observed in 34 deficits (15%), improvement in 126 deficits (54%), stability in 34 deficits (15%), and progression in 39 deficits (17%). The 12-month CNS progression-free survival was 77% among those receiving CS/WB and 51% among those receiving base of skull RT (P=.02). On multivariate analysis, patients who did not undergo stem cell transplantation after RT and base of skull RT were associated with worse CNS progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement or resolution of symptoms occurred in two thirds of deficits after RT. Comprehensive radiation to the WB or CS seems to offer a better outcome, especially in isolated CNS involvement.","['Walker, Gary V', 'Shihadeh, Ferial', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Allen, Pamela', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Kebriaei, Partow', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kedir, Aziza', 'Said, Mustefa', 'Grant, Jonathan D', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Gidley, Paul W', 'Arzu, Isidora', 'Pinnix, Chelsea', 'Reed, Valerie', 'Dabaja, Bouthaina S']","['Walker GV', 'Shihadeh F', 'Kantarjian H', 'Allen P', 'Rondon G', 'Kebriaei P', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kedir A', 'Said M', 'Grant JD', 'Thomas DA', 'Gidley PW', 'Arzu I', 'Pinnix C', 'Reed V', 'Dabaja BS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to examine self-reported pain among adolescents diagnosed with leukemia or a brain tumor. METHODS: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews since inception to May 2014 were conducted. Search terms included pain; a second term including adolescent, juvenile, youth, child, or childhood; and a third term including cancer, leukemia, or brain tumor. Adolescents were defined as being 10 to 19 years of age. RESULTS: A total of 30 articles met inclusion criteria. Pain was reported associated with the cancer itself, with treatments, and with procedures and was assessed via a variety of measures and methods. Pain was also found to persist long after treatment completion. CONCLUSION: Pain is a frequently reported symptom among adolescents with leukemia or a brain tumor. More consistent inclusion of established measures across studies could increase the availability of data suitable for meta-analyses while also providing information on which aspects of the pain experience are understudied. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Rigorous assessment of pain should be conducted from diagnosis throughout the cancer continuum into long-term survivorship or end of life, with particular attention paid to before and after treatment procedures. Improved pain management incorporating behavioral and/or pharmacological strategies may result in improved quality of life for adolescents with cancer.","['Olson, Katie', 'Amari, Adrianna']","['Olson K', 'Amari A']","[""Author Affiliations: Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC (Dr Olson); and Department of Behavioral Psychology, The Kennedy Krieger Institute, and Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland (Dr Amari).""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0000000000000214 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2015 Sep-Oct;38(5):E43-53. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000214.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Pain/*etiology', 'Quality of Life', '*Self Report']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concurrence of acute lymphoblastic malignancy with pregnancy is therefore most likely to happen during the younger childbearing ages. However, the therapeutic challenges posed by the dual diagnosis of lymphoblastic malignancy and pregnancy have not specifically been studied in the context of age, and management guidelines for pregnant young patients are lacking. Inconsistency in defining the legal decision-making rights of pregnant teenaged patients adds a further level of complexity in this age group. Management of this challenging combination in the young patient therefore entails unique ethical considerations. Here we present two illustrative cases of teenage pregnancy complicated by acute lymphoblastic malignancy, review the available literature, and offer suggestions for the therapeutic management of such cases in adolescent and young adult patients. Importantly, practical management recommendations are provided in the context of clinical ethics principles that are universally applicable, including in developing countries, where the highest incidence of adolescent pregnancies has been documented.","['Zaidi, Alia', 'Johnson, Liza-Marie', 'Church, Christopher L', 'Gomez-Garcia, Wendy C', 'Popescu, Marcela I', 'Margolin, Judith F', 'Ribeiro, Raul C']","['Zaidi A', 'Johnson LM', 'Church CL', 'Gomez-Garcia WC', 'Popescu MI', 'Margolin JF', 'Ribeiro RC']","[""International Outreach Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, Tennessee. ; Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Division of General and Health Studies, Baptist College of Health Sciences , Memphis, Tennessee.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Infantil Dr. Robert Reid Cabral , Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic .', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Jude Tri-Cities Affiliate , Johnson City, Tennessee.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital , Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],['Review'],,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,PMC4270130,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'lymphoma', 'pregnancy', 'teenager', 'teratogenicity']",2014/12/30 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1089/jayao.2014.0014 [doi]', '10.1089/jayao.2014.0014 [pii]']",ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2014 Dec 1;3(4):160-175. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2014.0014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these malignancies, hypogammaglobulinemia can be an intrinsic aspect of the disease or follow chemo-immunotherapy regimens, including anti-CD20 treatment. Other than in LPDs the broadening use of immunotherapy (e.g., rituximab) and immune-suppressive therapy (steroids, sulfasalazine, and mycophenolate mofetil) has extended the occurrence of iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia.

We focus on the role of CAV1 when overexpressed in T-cell leukemia. Previously, we have shown that CAV1 is involved in cell-to-cell communication, cellular proliferation, and immune synapse formation; however, the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that the role of CAV1 in immune synapse formation contributes to immune regulation during leukemic progression, thereby warranting studies of the role of CAV1 in CD4(+) T-cells in relation to antigen-presenting cells. To address this need, we developed a computational model of a CD4(+) immune effector T-cell to mimic cellular dynamics and molecular signaling under healthy and immunocompromised conditions (i.e., leukemic conditions). Using the Cell Collective computational modeling software, the CD4(+) T-cell model was constructed and simulated under CAV1 (+/+), CAV1 (+/-), and CAV1 (-/-) conditions to produce a hypothetical immune response. This model allowed us to predict and examine the heterogeneous effects and mechanisms of CAV1 in silico. Experimental results indicate a signature of molecules involved in cellular proliferation, cell survival, and cytoskeletal rearrangement that were highly affected by CAV1 knock out. With this comprehensive model of a CD4(+) T-cell, we then validated in vivo protein expression levels. Based on this study, we modeled a CD4(+) T-cell, manipulated gene expression in immunocompromised versus competent settings, validated these manipulations in an in vivo murine model, and corroborated acute T-cell leukemia gene expression profiles in human beings. Moreover, we can model an immunocompetent versus an immunocompromised microenvironment to better understand how signaling is regulated in patients with leukemia.","['Conroy, Brittany D', 'Herek, Tyler A', 'Shew, Timothy D', 'Latner, Matthew', 'Larson, Joshua J', 'Allen, Laura', 'Davis, Paul H', 'Helikar, Tomas', 'Cutucache, Christine E']","['Conroy BD', 'Herek TA', 'Shew TD', 'Latner M', 'Larson JJ', 'Allen L', 'Davis PH', 'Helikar T', 'Cutucache CE']","['Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska at Lincoln , Lincoln, NE , USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141205,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC4257089,['NOTNLM'],"['CD4+ T-lymphocyte', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'caveolin-1', 'computational biology', 'immunosuppression', 'immunotherapy', 'logical models', 'the cell collective']",2014/12/30 06:00,2014/12/30 06:01,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2014.00599 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2014 Dec 5;5:599. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00599. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,['P20 GM103427/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: The present study assesses the immediate effects of ALL treatment on neuropsychological functioning, at the Regional Cancer Center in Chennai, South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed with ALL patients (n = 24) (aged 6-15 years; 13M:11F) registered between March 2008 and February 2009 were included. Patients who had received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cranial radiotherapy (CRT) as part of their treatment were enrolled for the study. Neurocognitive assessments were done to assess various functions such as performance intelligence, visuo-perception, visuo-spatial, perceptual organization, processing speed, planning, working memory, and immediate verbal memory (IVM) (Malin's intelligence scale); verbal fluency (ideation fluency test) and verbal attention (vigilance test). Three assessments were done during induction (baseline), after re-induction phase (second) and during the maintenance phase (third). RESULTS: The patients performed significantly worse in the third assessment (mean duration from diagnosis 17.48 months) on performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), visuo-perception, visuo-spatial, processing speed, planning, IVM, verbal attention, and verbal fluency (P < 0.05), there were no significant changes observed in visuo-perceptual organization and working memory (P > 0.05). Significant difference was observed between age groups 6 and 10 (41.7%) and 11-15 years (58.3%) in perceptual organization, verbal fluency, and verbal attention (P < 0.05) and no gender difference was observed across the three assessments (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining HD MTX and CRT had an immediate effect on neuropsychological sequelae among the children with ALL, however, long-term evaluation is recommended to study the long-term effects.","['Chidambaram, Sundaramoorthy', 'Seshachalam, Arun', 'Elangovan, Vidhubala', 'Rajendranath, Rejiv']","['Chidambaram S', 'Seshachalam A', 'Elangovan V', 'Rajendranath R']","['Department of Psycho-Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India.', 'GVN Cancer Hospital, Trichy, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Psycho-Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,PMC4264275,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'central nervous system prophylaxis', 'chemotherapy', 'cranial radiation', 'neuro-cognitive functions']",2014/12/30 06:00,2014/12/30 06:01,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.144990 [doi]', 'IJMPO-35-281 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2014 Oct;35(4):281-7. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.144990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purine Analogs 6-MP/6-thioguanine/azathiopurine are metabolized to its inactive form by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Ninety percent of the population harbor wild type on both alleles (TPMT wild/wild), 10% are heterozygous, that is, one allele is mutant (TPMT wild/mutant) and 0.3% are homozygous, that is, both allele are mutant (TPMT mutant/mutant). In heterozygous and homozygous variant, activity of enzyme is low, leading to a higher incidence of toxicity (myelosuppression). AIM: The primary objective was to access the polymorphism of the enzyme, TPMT, in Children with ALL. Secondary objective was to correlate TPMT genotype with 6-MP toxicities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two children with newly diagnosed ALL during first maintenance phase were serially enrolled after obtaining consent. Five ml of peripheral blood was drawn and DNA extracted. TPMT 2 polymorphisms were performed using Allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and TPMT 3B and 3C are performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children of 72 (95.8%) were wild for TPMT polymorphism and 3 (4.2%) were heterozygous for TPMT. Among the heterozygous variant one each (33.3%) were heterozygous for 2A, 3A, 3C. Febrile neutropenia was the most common toxicity in both wild and heterozygous group. CONCLUSION: The frequency of TPMT polymorphisms in children with ALL is 4.2%.

This disorder is characterized by pancytopenia, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis and the presence of atypical lymphoid cells with hairy projections in peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen. Treatment is mainly with nucleoside analog cladribine, which induces complete remission in up to 85% cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of Hairy cell Leukemia cases diagnosed and treated in the Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi between 2002 and 2013. Various parameters such as clinical features, laboratory parameters including complete blood cell count, bone marrow findings, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping by flowcytometry or immunohistochemistry, treatment protocol and complications secondary to treatment and relapse were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 35 cases were diagnosed during this period of 12 years of which 27 received cladribine and went in to remission. Median follow-up duration was 26 months. 5 (18%) cases had a relapse and all relapsed cases achieved second remission with cladribine; however, there was no case of second malignancy in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Cladribine has emerged as the treatment of choice for hairy cell leukemia given that the overwhelming majority of patients achieve long-lasting complete remissions. Upon relapse, these patients could be successfully salvaged with cladribine retreatment.","['Somasundaram, Venkatesan', 'Purohit, Abhishek', 'Aggarwal, Mukul', 'Manivannan, Prabhu', 'Mishra, Pravas', 'Seth, Tulika', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Pati, Hara P', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Somasundaram V', 'Purohit A', 'Aggarwal M', 'Manivannan P', 'Mishra P', 'Seth T', 'Tyagi S', 'Mahapatra M', 'Pati HP', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,PMC4264273,['NOTNLM'],"['Cladribine', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'relapse', 'remission']",2014/12/30 06:00,2014/12/30 06:01,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.144988 [doi]', 'IJMPO-35-271 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2014 Oct;35(4):271-5. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.144988.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A coordinated humoral and cellular response accomplishes leukemia cell killing, but the specific targets remain largely uncharacterized. To learn more about the antigens that elicit antibodies during GVL reactions, we analyzed patients with advanced myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who received an autologous, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting tumor cell vaccine early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A combination of tumor-derived cDNA expression library screening, protein microarrays, and antigen-specific ELISAs were used to characterize sera obtained longitudinally from 15 patients with AML/MDS who were vaccinated early after allogeneic HSCT. RESULTS: A broad, therapy-induced antibody response was uncovered, which primarily targeted intracellular proteins that function in growth, transcription/translation, metabolism, and homeostasis. Unexpectedly, antibodies were also elicited against eight secreted angiogenic cytokines that play critical roles in leukemogenesis. Antibodies to the angiogenic cytokines were evident early after therapy, and in some patients manifested a diversification in reactivity over time. Patients that developed antibodies to multiple angiogenic cytokines showed prolonged remission and survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal a potent humoral response during GVL reactions induced with vaccination early after allogeneic HSCT and raise the possibility that antibodies, in conjunction with natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, may contribute to immune-mediated control of myeloid leukemias.","['Piesche, Matthias', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Kim, Haesook', 'Nakazaki, Yukoh', 'Nehil, Michael', 'Yaghi, Nasser K', 'Kolodin, Dmitriy', 'Weiser, Jeremy', 'Altevogt, Peter', 'Kiefel, Helena', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Koreth, John', 'Canning, Christine', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Dranoff, Glenn']","['Piesche M', 'Ho VT', 'Kim H', 'Nakazaki Y', 'Nehil M', 'Yaghi NK', 'Kolodin D', 'Weiser J', 'Altevogt P', 'Kiefel H', 'Alyea EP', 'Antin JH', 'Cutler C', 'Koreth J', 'Canning C', 'Ritz J', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Dranoff G']","[""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Translational Immunology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Translational Immunology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. glenn_dranoff@dfci.harvard.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141223,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC4348150,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2016/03/19 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-1956 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1956 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 Mar 1;21(5):1010-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1956.

To identify potential mechanisms underlying this inherent resistance phenomenon, we performed pathway-centric, gain-of-function screens in JAK2(V617F) hematopoietic cells and found that the activation of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS or its effector pathways [mediated by the kinases AKT and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)] renders cells insensitive to JAK inhibition. Resistant MPN cells became sensitized to JAK inhibitors when also exposed to inhibitors of the AKT or ERK pathways. Mechanistically, in JAK2(V617F) cells, a JAK2-mediated inactivating phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD [B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-associated death promoter] promoted cell survival. In sensitive cells, exposure to a JAK inhibitor resulted in dephosphorylation of BAD, enabling BAD to bind and sequester the prosurvival protein BCL-XL (BCL-2-like 1), thereby triggering apoptosis. In resistant cells, RAS effector pathways maintained BAD phosphorylation in the presence of JAK inhibitors, yielding a specific dependence on BCL-XL for survival. In patients with MPNs, activating mutations in RAS co-occur with the JAK2(V617F) mutation in the malignant cells, suggesting that RAS effector pathways likely play an important role in clinically observed resistance.","['Winter, Peter S', 'Sarosiek, Kristopher A', 'Lin, Kevin H', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Wood, Kris C']","['Winter PS', 'Sarosiek KA', 'Lin KH', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Schnittger S', 'Letai A', 'Wood KC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), neoplastic B cells evade apoptosis owing to the overexpression of survival proteins. We hypothesized that direct activation of procaspases could bypass the apoptosis resistance induced by the upstream prosurvival proteins. The procaspase-activating compounds (PAC-1), including B-PAC-1 (L14R8), convert inactive executioner procaspases to their active cleaved forms by chelation of labile zinc ions. Both at transcript and protein levels, primary CLL cells express high levels of latent procaspases (3, -7, and -9). B-PAC-1 treatment induced CLL lymphocyte death which was higher than that in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells or B cells, and was independent of prognostic markers and microenvironmental factors. Mechanistically, B-PAC-1 treatment activated executioner procaspases and not other Zn-dependent enzymes. Exogenous zinc completely, and pancaspase inhibitors partially, reversed B-PAC-1-induced apoptosis, elucidating the zinc-mediated mechanism of action. The cell demise relied on the presence of caspase-3/7 but not caspase-8 or Bax/Bak proteins. B-PAC-1 in combination with an inhibitor of apoptosis protein antagonist (Smac066) synergistically induced apoptosis in CLL samples. Our investigations demonstrated that direct activation of executioner procaspases via B-PAC-1 treatment bypasses apoptosis resistance and is a novel approach for CLL therapeutics.","['Patel, Viralkumar', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Patel V', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX; and Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141223,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4326772,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35274-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-01-546796 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 12;125(7):1126-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-01-546796.

In MLL-AF4 patients, CD34(+)CD38(+)CD19(+) and CD34(-)CD19(+) cells initiated leukemia, and in MLL-AF9 patients, CD34(-)CD19(+) cells were LICs.

A comparison of flow cytometric and cytochemical myeloperoxidase using different flow cytometric cut-offs.,455-461,10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000223 [doi],"Objectives Myeloperoxidase (MPO) detection either by enzyme cytochemistry (cMPO) or flow cytometry (fMPO) plays a major role in acute leukaemia (AL) diagnosis as per World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification. Although 3% cMPO was recommended as positivity, no specific cut-off had been mentioned by WHO for fMPO. Various authors recommend different cut-offs ranging from 3 to 28% for fMPO. The aim of this study was to analyse fMPO cut-offs ranging from 3 to 10% in classifying AL and to assess whether a new cut-off could be suggested. Methods Totally, 216 cases of AL were retrospectively analysed for fMPO ranging from 3 to 10% and compared with gold standard. Presence of cMPO (>/=3%) and/or expression of two or more pan-myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, and CD117) in the absence of CD19 and CD3 were kept as gold standard for diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results Sensitivities for classifying AL as AML/mixed phenotypic acute leukaemia (MPAL) at 3, 5.4, and 10% were 98.3, 98.3, and 96.6%, respectively, whereas specificities at this cut-off were 22.2, 91, and 71%, respectively. Discussion Only few studies have been done in this aspect to define a consistent cut-off for fMPO for proper classification of acute leukaemias. This was one of the largest and few studies available till date in this regard. Conclusion The newer cut-off for fMPO (5.4%) emerged out from our study with best sensitivity and specificity for accurately classifying AL cases into acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, AML, and MPAL.","['Manivannan, Prabhu', 'Puri, Vandana', 'Somasundaram, Venkatesan', 'Purohit, Abhishek', 'Sharma, Rahul Kumar', 'Dabas, Mandeep', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Manivannan P', 'Puri V', 'Somasundaram V', 'Purohit A', 'Sharma RK', 'Dabas M', 'Saxena R']","['a Department of Hematology All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Hematology All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Hematology All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Hematology All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Hematology All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Hematology All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.', 'a Department of Hematology All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141223,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL - acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'AML - acute myeloid leukaemia', 'FCM - flow cytometry', 'MPAL - mixed phenotypic acute leukaemia', 'MPO - myeloperoxidase']",2014/12/30 06:00,2014/12/30 06:01,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:01 [medline]', '2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000223 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Sep;20(8):455-461. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000223.

Indeed, we consider these unknown inherent factors could be explained via coupling cytogenetics plus proteomics, especially when proteins are the ones which play function within cells. Innovative proteomics to ALL therapy may help to understand the mechanism of drug resistance and toxicities, which in turn will provide some leads to improve ALL management. Most important of these are shotgun proteomic strategies to unravel ALL aberrant signalling networks. Some shotgun proteomic innovations and bioinformatic tools for ALL therapies will be discussed.

METHOD: Eighty-two children with ALL in Division of Hematology of Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 2008 to February 2013 were enrolled. All patients were genotyped for rs4149056 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) into wild-type group (TT genotype) and variant group (TC/CC genotype). According to the ALL-BFM 2000 protocol, all patients received intravenous infusion of MTX every ten days at 3 to 5 g/m(2). Leucovorin rescue was performed after 36 hours of the MTX administration and its dose was adjusted according to the MTX plasma concentration at 48 hours. The concentrations of MTX and its metabolite at 24, 48 and 72 h were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with solid phase extraction. Population pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by the NLME software. The pharmacokinetics, toxicity and leucovorin rescue was compared. The relapse rate within 5 years and event-free survival were followed up. RESULT: Eighty-two pediatric patients were classified into two groups: variant group including 20 TC genotype carriers and one CC genotype carrier, wild-type group included 61 patients with TT genotype. Compared with wild-type group, plasma concentration of MTX at 48 and 72 h increased significantly [48 h: (1.00+/-1.41) vs.(0.34+/-0.17) micromol/L, t=2.131, P=0.046; 72 h: (0.31+/-0.26) vs.(0.08+/-0.04) micromol/L; t=3.995, P=0.001]. Area under the concentration time curve (AUC48- proportional, variant) of MTX significantly increased in variant group [(23.18+/-19.91) vs.(5.66+/-2.01) h.micromol/L] (t=4.025, P=0.001). Time above the MTX safety threshold (TC>0.1 micromol/L) increased significantly in variant group [(95.3+/-22.0) vs.(67.1+/-7.5) h, t=5.880, P<0.001]. Rescue dosage of leucovorin in variant group was higher than that in wild-type group [(312.7+/-287.8) vs.(140.6+/-27.5) mg/m2, t=2.614, P=0.017]. The children carrying rs4149056 C allele suffered from a higher frequency of serious adverse effect [gastrointestinal toxicity: 33% (7/21) vs. 5% (3/61);hepatic toxicity: 24% (5/21) vs. 2% (1/61)]. The difference was statistically significant (chi2=9.275, 8.289, all P<0.05). Hospital stay of variant group was significantly longer than that of wild-type [(4.95+/-1.43) vs. (4.05+/-0.22) d, t=2.881, P=0.009]. The relapse rate within 5 years of variant group and wild-type group were 9% (2/21) and 13% (8/61), respectively.

While a family clustering of GBM has long been acknowledged, relevant hereditary factors still remained elusive. Exome sequencing of families offers the option to discover respective genetic factors.We sequenced blood samples of one of the rare affected families: while both parents were healthy, both children were diagnosed with GBM. We report 85 homozygous non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in both siblings that were heterozygous in the parents. Beyond known key players for GBM such as ERBB2, PMS2, or CHI3L1, we identified over 50 genes that have not been associated to GBM so far. We also discovered three accumulative effects potentially adding to the tumorigenesis in the siblings: a clustering of multiple variants in single genes (e.g., PTPRB, CROCC), the aggregation of affected genes on specific molecular pathways (e.g., Focal adhesion or ECM receptor interaction) and genomic proximity (e.g., chr22.q12.2, chr1.p36.33). We found a striking accumulation of SNVs in specific genes for the daughter, who developed not only a GBM at the age of 12 years but was subsequently diagnosed with a pilocytic astrocytoma, a common acute lymphatic leukemia and a diffuse pontine glioma.The reported variants underline the relevance of genetic predisposition and cancer development in this family and demonstrate that GBM has a complex and heterogeneous genetic background. Sequencing of other affected families will help to further narrow down the driving genetic causes for this disease.","['Backes, Christina', 'Harz, Christian', 'Fischer, Ulrike', 'Schmitt, Jana', 'Ludwig, Nicole', 'Petersen, Britt-Sabina', 'Mueller, Sabine C', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Wolf, Nadine M', 'Katus, Hugo A', 'Meder, Benjamin', 'Furtwangler, Rhoikos', 'Franke, Andre', 'Bohle, Rainer', 'Henn, Wolfram', 'Graf, Norbert', 'Keller, Andreas', 'Meese, Eckart']","['Backes C', 'Harz C', 'Fischer U', 'Schmitt J', 'Ludwig N', 'Petersen BS', 'Mueller SC', 'Kim YJ', 'Wolf NM', 'Katus HA', 'Meder B', 'Furtwangler R', 'Franke A', 'Bohle R', 'Henn W', 'Graf N', 'Keller A', 'Meese E']","['Clinical Bioinformatics, University of Saarland, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Haus Niemannsweg, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinical Bioinformatics, University of Saarland, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Saarland, Medical School, Building, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Haus Niemannsweg, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Saarland, Medical School, Building, Homburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.', 'Clinical Bioinformatics, University of Saarland, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Saarland, Medical School, Homburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC4467411,['NOTNLM'],"['bioinformatics', 'glioblastoma multiforme', 'next generation sequencing']",2014/12/30 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['2950 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2950 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 20;6(8):5918-31. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2950.,,IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Brain Neoplasms/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', '*Exome', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glioblastoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pedigree']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although resulting in a favorable outcome in young patients, older individuals, the most affected population, do not respond adequately to therapy. Intriguingly, the mechanisms responsible for AML cells chemoresistance/susceptibility are still elusive. Mounting evidence has shed light on the relevance of proteolytic systems (autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system, UPS), as well as the AMPK pathway, in AML biology and treatment, but their exact role is still controversial. Herein, two AML cell lines (HL-60 and KG-1) were exposed to conventional chemotherapeutic agents (cytarabine and/or doxorubicin) to assess the relevance of autophagy and UPS on AML cells' response to antileukemia drugs. Our results clearly showed that the antileukemia agents target both proteolytic systems and the AMPK pathway. Doxorubicin enhanced UPS activity while drugs' combination blocked autophagy specifically on HL-60 cells. In contrast, KG-1 cells responded in a more subtle manner to the drugs tested consistent with the higher UPS activity of these cells. In addition, the data demonstrates that autophagy may play a protective role depending on AML subtype. Specific modulators of autophagy and UPS are, therefore, promising targets for combining with standard therapeutic interventions in some AML subtypes.","['Fernandes, Angela', 'Azevedo, Maria M', 'Pereira, Olga', 'Sampaio-Marques, Belem', 'Paiva, Artur', 'Correia-Neves, Margarida', 'Castro, Isabel', 'Ludovico, Paula']","['Fernandes A', 'Azevedo MM', 'Pereira O', 'Sampaio-Marques B', 'Paiva A', 'Correia-Neves M', 'Castro I', 'Ludovico P']","['Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Blood and Transplantation Center of Coimbra, Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Portugal.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC4741616,['NOTNLM'],"['AMPK pathway', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'chemotherapeutic agents', 'macroautophagy', 'ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)']",2014/12/30 06:00,2016/08/09 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['2947 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2947 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Oct 13;6(31):31428-40. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2947.,,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors']","['0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Guidelines indicate that children should be involved in the consent procedure. It is, however, unclear how to allocate an appropriate role for children. Knowledge of current practice will be helpful in addressing this issue. Therefore, we conducted an international multiple-case study on the child's role in consent procedures in pediatric biobanks. Four biobanks were included: (1) LifeLines, (2) Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA), (3) Young-HUNT3 and (4) the Oxford Radcliffe Biobank contribution to the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group tissue bank (ORB/CCLG). Four themes linked to the child's role in the consent procedure emerged from the multiple-case study: (1) motives to involve the child, (2) informing the child, (3) the role of dissent, assent and consent and (4) voluntariness of children to participate. We conclude that biobank characteristics influence the biobank's motives to include children in the consent procedure. Moreover, the motives to include children influence how the children are involved in the consent procedure, and the extent to which children are able to make voluntary decisions as part of the consent procedure. This insight is valuable when designing pediatric biobank governance.","['Giesbertz, Noor Aa', 'Bredenoord, Annelien L', 'van Delden, Johannes Jm']","['Giesbertz NA', 'Bredenoord AL', 'van Delden JJ']","['Department of Medical Humanities, Julius Center, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Humanities, Julius Center, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Humanities, Julius Center, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,PMC4538194,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ejhg2014267 [pii]', '10.1038/ejhg.2014.267 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2015 Sep;23(9):1129-34. doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2014.267.

We searched for links between baseline levels and age, hyperleukocytosis, secondary origin of AML, resistance to induction therapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin and standard risk stratification according to cytogenetics and molecular genetics. METHODS: We evaluated the sera of 51 consecutive patients. Serum samples were analyzed by biochip based immunoassays on the Evidence Investigator analyzer. T-tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: We found that higher age is associated with lower levels of interleukin (IL)-12. Patients with secondary disease were older, had higher levels of EGF and IL-7, and lower levels of E-selectin, IL-12 and IL-13. In hyperleukocytosis, the levels of IL-1beta, IL-2, TNF-alpha, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, -E-selectin and L-selectin were increased, whereas levels of IFN-gamma and MCP-1 were decreased. In patients who failed to achieve complete remission after induction therapy, we found lower E-selectin and P-selectin levels. High risk patients had lower levels of IFN-gamma. CONCLUSION: Some leukemic cell subpopulations have the ability to produce cytokines that modulate the microenvironment by inducing inflammation. This causes endothelial cells to be activated and overexpress adhesion molecules. Hyperleukocytosis and secondary origin of the disease are the major factors influencing the cytokine and adhesion molecule profile in newly diagnosed AML patients.","['Kupsa, T', 'Vasatova, M', 'Karesova, I', 'Zak, P', 'Horacek, J M']","['Kupsa T', 'Vasatova M', 'Karesova I', 'Zak P', 'Horacek JM']","['Department of Military Internal Medicine and Military Hygiene, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences, Hradec Kralove 50001, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Diagnostics, University Hospital, Hradec Kralove 50005, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Diagnostics, University Hospital, Hradec Kralove 50005, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology, University Hospital and Charles University, Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove 50005, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Military Internal Medicine and Military Hygiene, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences, Hradec Kralove 50001, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,,,,2014/12/30 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/12/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['7330 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2014 Dec;36(4):252-7.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic']","['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of cross-resistance to PDT in cells with different MDR pathways and resistance levels seems to be advantageous for elucidating the general mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to various treatment modalities. AIM: The aim of the study was to clarify whether the Jurkat/A4 leukemia cells with MDR phenotype are cross-resistant to PDT. METHODS: Human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat and Jurkat/A4 subline with MDR phenotype were used. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and Photolon (a complex of chlorine-e6 and polyvinylpyrrolidone; PL) or gold nanocomposite of PL were applied as photosensitizers. The cells were pretreated with photosensitizers and exposed to laser radiation at corresponding wavelengths. The phototoxicity was assessed in trypan blue exclusion test. The hypodiploid cell fraction was analyzed by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. Expression of genes related to PDT resistance was analyzed by microarray technique with Affymetrix U133A chips. RESULTS: ALA-mediated PDT resulted in dose-dependent cell death in both lines, the relative photodynamic efficacy in Jurkat/A4 cells being inferior to that in the parental Jurkat cells. There was no correlation between phototoxicity and apoptosis induction both in Jurkat and Jurkat/A4 cells. PL-mediated general phototoxicity in Jurkat cells amounted up to 75% at the maximal photosensitizer dose with about 40% of apoptotic death fraction. PL-phototoxicity in Jurkat/A4 cells was considerably lower. In contrast to Jurkat cells, PL-gold composite did not increase the efficacy of photosensitization as compared to free PL in Jurkat/A4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Multidrug-resistant Jurkat/A4 cells exhibit reduced sensitivity to phototoxic effect in comparison with parental Jurkat cells independently of nature of the photosensitizer being assayed.","['Philchenkov, A A', 'Shishko, E D', 'Zavelevich, M P', 'Kuiava, L M', 'Miura, K', 'Blokhin, D Y', 'Shton, I O', 'Gamaleia, N F']","['Philchenkov AA', 'Shishko ED', 'Zavelevich MP', 'Kuiava LM', 'Miura K', 'Blokhin DY', 'Shton IO', 'Gamaleia NF']","['R.E.

The difficulty is caused by the lack of knowledge about spermatogenesis molecular-controlling mechanisms. In vivo, PGCs differentiate into male germ cells in a very complicated environment through many middle steps. In this study, we use the pluripotent p19 cells to test their responses to different retinoic acid (RA) concentrations by evaluating markers for stem cells (bmp4, egr3), primordial germ cells (ddx4), spermatogonia (c-kit), premeiotic cells (stra8), and male germ cells (dazl and plzf). We have found that cyp26b1, which will catalyze RA, increases dramatically in p19 cells 1 d after RA treatment. Bmp3, egr3, and stra8 are stimulated after 1 d of RA treatment and then recover to normal after 3 d of RA treatment. C-kit keeps being expressed when treated with 10 nM-4 muM RA. Dazl and plzf are gained after 3 d of stimulation. The morphology of RA (100 nM-4 muM)-treated cells changes distinctively, and cell colonies are formed. Typical neural cell-like and germ cell-like morphologies appear in the 100 nM and 4 muM RA groups, respectively. We conclude that 100-500 nM RA can cause responses in p19 cells, but a high concentration of RA (1-4 muM) can drive these pluripotent cells' differentiation towards male germ cells. However, high concentrations of RA are also toxic. Some colonies that survived from 4 muM RA begin to express ddx4 and c-kit. Selection of the c-kit(+), dazl(+), and ddx4(+) cells after RA stimulation and creating a special culture medium for their propagation might benefit successful spermatogenesis induction in vitro.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Tang, Jiangjing', 'Haines, Christopher J', 'Feng, Huai', 'Teng, Xiaoming', 'Han, Yibing']","['Zhang L', 'Tang J', 'Haines CJ', 'Feng H', 'Teng X', 'Han Y']","['Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141224,Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Their potential to repair damaged tissues through trans differentiation in conjunction with their immunomodulatory ability made them promising candidates for cell-based immunotherapy and regenerative medicine. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effects of MSCs on proliferation, apoptosis and gene expression profile of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line CCRF-CEM. METHODS: The experiments were performed after MSCs and CCRF-CEM cells were co-cultured for 72 hrs. We analyzed the gene expression patterns to predict oncogenic pathway dysregulation in the cell groups by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in co-cultured CCRF-CEM cells compared to the control. Furthermore, growth factors, p53, Bax and Caspase-9 expressions were increased and cell-signaling gene expressions decreased significantly. Despite increased levels of growth factors (CTGF, VEGF, FGF, EGFR), the increased apoptosis level was triggered by p53/ Bax. CONCLUSION: In this study we have shown that human MSCs have inhibitory effect on their neighboring malignant leukemia cells.","['Bozok Cetintas, Vildan', 'Aktug, Huseyin', 'Oltulu, Fatih', 'Keskinoglu, Ahmet', 'Erer Del Castello, Buket', 'Taskiran, Dilek']","['Bozok Cetintas V', 'Aktug H', 'Oltulu F', 'Keskinoglu A', 'Erer Del Castello B', 'Taskiran D']","['Department of Medical Biology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,,2014/12/24 06:00,2018/06/23 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2014 Oct-Dec;19(4):1006-17.,,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on MDS biology in young patients are yet scarce but more than necessary. The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion of MDS patients <50 years of age and to compare the clinicopathological data between younger and older patients. METHODS: Of our total MDS cases comprising 587 adult patients we studied 83 adults (14.14%) aged < 50 years with primary MDS. RESULTS: MDS patients were classified in those aged < 50 years and those aged >/= 50 years. Younger MDS patients were characterized by female preponderance (p<0.001), better performance status (p=0.0035), less severe anaemia (p=0.008), better preserved kidney function (p=0.037), less often blast infiltration in bone marrow (p=0.015), more cases of RA (p<0.001) and RCUD (p=0.0066), lower MD Anderson score (p<0.001), longer overall survival (OS) (p<0.001), but similar progression rate (p=0.591). Median OS of young MDS patients was 39.7 months and 19 months of patients >50 years (p<0.001). In this group, 24 patients (28.92%) progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) vs 111 (22.02%) patients>50 years (p=0.402). Multivariate analysis identified platelet count (p=0.008) and percent of blasts in bone marrow (p=0.024) to be predictive for shorter OS in patients < 50 years of age; the same factors (p<0.001) together with IPSS-R cytogenetic risk group (p<0.001) were identified in patients >50 years of age. Platelet count (p=0.003) and percent of blasts in bone marrow (p=0.001) were predictive for higher risk of transformation to AML in patients <50 years, and bone marrow infiltration (p=0.022) and IPSS-R cytogenetic risk group (p=0.027) for patients >50 years of age.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is a polyphenol in green tea, induces apoptosis in different types of cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of ponatinib and EGCG combination in K562 CML cell line. This study also aimed to detect alterations of the expression levels of cell cycle-regulation related genes after ponatinib and EGCG combination in K562 CML cell line. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of the compounds on K562 cells were determined in a time-and dose-dependent manner by using WST-1 analysis. The combination index (CI) isobologram was used to analyze the data. Apoptotic effects of P-EGCG were defined by flow cytometry and gene expressions were detected by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: IC50values of ponatinib and EGCG were 87.13 nM and 50muM, respectively. CI value of the P-EGCG was 0.658 and the combination showed synergistic effect (ED90 value: 28.39 nM ponatinib, 117.12 mug/ml EGCG). Ponatinib, EGCG and P-EGCG induced apoptosis compared to control cells. CyclinD1 and CDC25A were downregulated by P-EGCG by 2.49 and 2.63-fold, respectively. TGF-beta2 was upregulated by 4.57-fold. CONCLUSION: EGCG possesses cytotoxic and apoptotic properties and may cooperate with the growth inhibiting activity of ponatinib synergistically against CML cells. P-EGCG mediated apoptosis might be associated with upregulation of TGF-beta2 gene and downregulation of cyclinD1 and CDC25A genes.","['Goker, Bakiye', 'Caliskan, Cansu', 'Onur Caglar, Hasan', 'Kayabasi, Cagla', 'Balci, Tugce', 'Erbaykent Tepedelen, Burcu', 'Aygunes, Duygu', 'Yilmaz Susluer, Sunde', 'Mutlu, Zeynep', 'Selvi Gunel, Nur', 'Korkmaz, Mehmet', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Gunduz, Cumhur', 'Biray Avci, Cigir']","['Goker B', 'Caliskan C', 'Onur Caglar H', 'Kayabasi C', 'Balci T', 'Erbaykent Tepedelen B', 'Aygunes D', 'Yilmaz Susluer S', 'Mutlu Z', 'Selvi Gunel N', 'Korkmaz M', 'Saydam G', 'Gunduz C', 'Biray Avci C']","['Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,,2014/12/24 06:00,2018/06/23 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2014 Oct-Dec;19(4):992-8.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Pyridazines/*pharmacology']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the efficiency of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chornobyl NPP accident, based on the data of cytogenetic and molecular monitoring. Material and methods. 29 CML patients with confirmed radiation exposure due to Chornobyl NPP accident were examined. Of these, 20 patients were treated with imatinib; 103 patients with CML without radiation history treated with TKI were a comparison group. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic disturbances before and on the different stage of TKI therapy were analysed. Results. Additional chromosomal abnormalities as well as special pattern of BCR/ABL transcripts were not revealed in CML patients exposed to ionizing radiation. Complete cytogenetic response (CCR) was shown in 50 and 48.5 % of patients from study and comparison group, respectively. Major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 20 % of patients with radiation exposure in anamnesis and in 27.6 % of patients from comparison group. The vast majority of CCR and MMR was reached in patients with the pretreatment term up to 6 months, when imatinib was used as a first line therapy. There were less cases of primary imatinib resistance in the same group of patients. In CML patients who had a history of radiation exposure, secondary resistance developed more frequently than in the comparison group and was 25 %. Conclusion. Laboratory monitoring based on the registration of CCR and MMR demonstrated high efficiency of TKI in the CML treatment of patients, exposed due to Chornobyl accident. Extension of pretreatment term leads to the loss of TKI therapy efficiency and increases the likelihood of primary resistance. CML patients exposed to ionizing radiation develop secondary resistence more often than CML patients without radiation exposure in anamnesis.","['Dmytrenko, I V', 'Fedorenko, V G', 'Shlyakhtychenko, T Y', 'Sholoyko, V V', 'Lyubarets, T F', 'Malinkina, T V', 'Dmytrenko, O O', 'Balan, V V', 'Kravchenko, S M', 'Martina, Z V', 'Tovstogan, A O', 'Minchenko, J M', 'Dyagil, I S']","['Dmytrenko IV', 'Fedorenko VG', 'Shlyakhtychenko TY', 'Sholoyko VV', 'Lyubarets TF', 'Malinkina TV', 'Dmytrenko OO', 'Balan VV', 'Kravchenko SM', 'Martina ZV', 'Tovstogan AO', 'Minchenko JM', 'Dyagil IS']","['State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.']","['eng', 'ukr']",['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'cytogenetic and molecular response', 'ionizing radiation', 'treatment efficiency', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2014/12/24 06:00,2014/12/24 06:01,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/24 06:01 [medline]']",['UDK 616.158.392:616-01.28-085:577.21 [pii]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2014 Sep;19:241-55.,"['I.

Serum calcium, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, cortisol and thyroid-stimulating hormone were investigated, as well as calcium and phosphate excretion, amino acids composition in the urine, acid-base balance and buffer systems of blood, bone density. Results. A reduction of bone densitometry, calcium and cortisol levels and increase of serum alkaline phosphatase and urine oxyproline were found in children with acute leukemia in acute I phase and during the chemotherapy. In the period of remission the majority of patients did not differ from the comparison group. The signs of osteopenic syndrome that require monitoring of the bone structure status were revealed in 10.0 % of children of the comparison group. Radiation doses of leukemia patients were 3.66 +/- 0.11 mSv. No relationship between radiation dose and indicators that reflect the state of the bone tissue structures has been established. The use of complex health care measures in children with acute leukemia in remission, contributed to the positive effect of 62.0 %. Worser effect was observed in patients with an unfavorable course of the disease. Conclusions. Results of the study of bone tissue metabolism prove fore a change in the organic and mineral matrix in patients with acute leukemia exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of the Chonobyl NPP accident, and persons without hematologic diseases, and the need for treatment and prevention.","['Bebeshko, V G', 'Bruslova, K M', 'Tsvietkova, N M', 'Volodina, T T', 'Kopylova, O V', 'Belingio, T O', 'Berezovski, S A', 'Petrunko, M P', 'Boyarskiy, V G', 'Polianska, V M', 'Pushkareva, T I', 'Mishchenko, L P']","['Bebeshko VG', 'Bruslova KM', 'Tsvietkova NM', 'Volodina TT', 'Kopylova OV', 'Belingio TO', 'Berezovski SA', 'Petrunko MP', 'Boyarskiy VG', 'Polianska VM', 'Pushkareva TI', 'Mishchenko LP']","['State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'A.

The goal of this study was to define levels and dynamic trends of cancer incidence at whole and some separate sites in groups of Ukrainian population affected by the Chornobyl accident during a long period of observation. Materials and methods. Those groups were Chornobyl accident recovery operation workers (CRW) of 1986-1987 years of participation, evacuees from Prypyat town and 30-km zone and residents of the most contaminated territories of Ukraine. Analysis was carried out with the standard methods of descriptive epidemiology: calculation of crude, age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates with standard errors and confidence intervals. Results, discussion and conclusions. This study showed that all cancer incidences exceeded the national level only in CRW group. Decrease of cancer incidence rate in the recent years might be caused by shortened average life expectancy in Ukrainian population, especially in males. Statistically significant increase of leukemia incidence in CRW group was registered as well. Besides, in all three main affected groups there was revealed significant excess of thyroid cancer. Irradiation of thyroid due to radioactive iodine fallouts might be a main cause of this phenomenon. Increase of thyroid cancer incidence was registered not only in children, but also in adolescents and adults. Appearance of excess thyroid cancer cases as an effect of radiation exposure tends to increase during the time. Significant excess was also revealed for breast cancer in female CRW group. Because latency period for different nosological forms of radiation-induced malignant tumors varies widely, profound attention in further studies should be drawn not only to thyroid, breast cancers and leukemia, but also to malignancies with longer latent period: lung, stomach, colon, ovary, urinary bladder, kidney cancer and multiple myeloma.","['Prysyazhnyuk, A Ye', 'Bazyka, D A', 'Romanenko, A Yu', 'Gudzenko, N A', 'Fuzik, M M', 'Trotsyuk, N K', 'Fedorenko, Z P', 'Gulak, L O', 'Slipenyuk, K M', 'Babkina, N G', 'Khukhrianska, O M', 'Goroh, Ye L', 'Berestyana, Zh M']","['Prysyazhnyuk AY', 'Bazyka DA', 'Romanenko AY', 'Gudzenko NA', 'Fuzik MM', 'Trotsyuk NK', 'Fedorenko ZP', 'Gulak LO', 'Slipenyuk KM', 'Babkina NG', 'Khukhrianska OM', 'Goroh YL', 'Berestyana ZhM']","['State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'National Cancer Institute, 33/43 Lomonosov str., Kyiv, 03022, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'National Cancer Institute, 33/43 Lomonosov str., Kyiv, 03022, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'National Cancer Institute, 33/43 Lomonosov str., Kyiv, 03022, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.', 'State Institution National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Melnykov str., 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. vkpand@ukr.net.']","['eng', 'ukr']",['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chornobyl accident', 'breast cancer', 'ionizing radiation', 'leukemia', 'malignant tumors', 'thyroid cancer']",2014/12/24 06:00,2014/12/24 06:01,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/24 06:01 [medline]']",['UDK 616-006:616-001.28:614-876:616-036.22 [pii]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2014 Sep;19:147-69.,"['A.

Heparan sulfate D-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1 (HS3ST3B1) participates in the last biosynthetic steps of HS and transfers sulfate to the 3-O-position of glucosamine residues to yield mature sugar chains. To date very few biological processes or proteins have been described that are modulated by HS3ST3B1. In this study, we observed that HS3ST3B1 positively contributed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression in vitro and in vivo, and these activities were associated with an induction of the proangiogenic factor VEGF expression and shedding. Moreover, the effects of HS3ST3B1 on VEGF release can be attenuated after treatment of heparanase inhibitor suramin, which prevented VEGF secretion and subsequently blocked VEGF-induced activation of ERK and AKT, suggesting that 3-O-sulfation of HS by HS3ST3B1 facilitated VEGF shedding; the effects of HS3ST3B1 on activation of ERK and AKT can also be blocked by VEGFR inhibitor axitinib, suggestive of a relationship between 3-O-sulfation of HS and VEGF-activated signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings support that VEGF is an important functional target of HS3ST3B1 and provide a new mechanism of HS3ST3B1 in AML.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Song, Kai', 'Zhou, Ling', 'Xie, Zhishen', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Zhao, Yiming', 'Han, Yue', 'Xu, Xiaojun', 'Li, Ping']","['Zhang L', 'Song K', 'Zhou L', 'Xie Z', 'Zhou P', 'Zhao Y', 'Han Y', 'Xu X', 'Li P']","['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,['NOTNLM'],"['ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML)', 'ERK', 'HEPARAN SULFATE (HS)', 'HEPARAN SULFATE 3-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE-3B1 (HS3ST3B1)', 'VEGF']",2014/12/24 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25066 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2015 Jun;116(6):1101-12. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25066.,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",IM,"['Axitinib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfotransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']","['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'C9LVQ0YUXG (Axitinib)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (Sulfotransferases)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the outcome of patients entered into S0106, a recently reported cooperative group trial for patients with newly diagnosed AML. A total of 589 eligible patients was treated, of whom 150 (25%) did not achieve a remission while on study and were available for further analysis. The 4-year survival rate for the entire cohort of 150 patients was 23%. Among the 64 patients who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, the 4-year survival rate was 48% compared with 4% for the 86 patients who did not undergo transplantation. Among those transplanted, we could not detect a difference in outcome according to remission status, donor source, type of preparative regimen, or cytogenetic risk category. More than 20% of patients with newly diagnosed AML who fail induction therapy can still be cured, particularly if they are able to receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

The human acute leukemia cell lines and primary blasts were treated with PP242 alone or in combination with daunorubicin (DNR). Cell proliferation was examined using an MTT assay. The phosphorylation expression of the Akt/mTORC1/eIF4E signaling pathway was assessed by western blot analysis. The assembly of the eIF4F translation initiation complex was examined using a 7-methyl-guanosine cap affinity assay. PP242 significantly induced cytotoxicity in human acute leukemia cells, especially in combination with DNR. The phosphorylation levels of eIF4E (p-eIF4E) at Ser209 influence the antileukemia roles of PP242. As expected, the antiproliferative effects of PP242 on leukemia cells with low p-eIF4E expression, such as the acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cell line and AML-M3 primary blasts, were poor. Surprisingly, the effects of PP242 in leukemia cells with high p-eIF4E expression, such as the acute myelomonocytic leukemia THP-1 cell line and M4-M5 primary blasts, were also weak. In contrast, PP242 exerted a significant antiproliferative effect in the Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia SUP-B15 cell line and the mantle cell lymphoma JEKO-1 cell line, which had intermediate p-eIF4E levels. PP242 inhibited the translation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 by downregulating the Akt/mTORC1/eIF4E signaling pathway. More importantly, DNR activated the Akt/mTORC1/eIF4E signaling pathway, whereas PP242 effectively eliminated this deleterious side effect of DNR and synergistically enhanced the anticancer ability of DNR treatment. PP242, especially in combination with DNR, exerts significant antileukemia effects.","['Shi, Fangfang', 'Yang, Xiaojing', 'Gong, Yuping', 'Shi, Rui', 'Yang, Xi', 'Naren, Duolan', 'Wu, Jiahui']","['Shi F', 'Yang X', 'Gong Y', 'Shi R', 'Yang X', 'Naren D', 'Wu J']","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,,,2014/12/24 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000200 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2015 Apr;26(4):410-21. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000200.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'H5669VNZ7V (PP242)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently identified the natural product marinopyrrole A (maritoclax) as a novel small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitor. Here, we describe the structure-activity relationship study of pyoluteorin derivatives based on maritoclax. To date, we synthesized over 30 derivatives of maritoclax and evaluated their inhibitory actions and cytotoxicity toward Mcl-1-dependent cell lines. As a result, several functional groups were identified in the pyoluteorin motif that significantly potentiate biological activity. A number of such derivatives, KS04 and KS18, interacted with Mcl-1 in a conserved fashion according to NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. KS04 and KS18 induced apoptosis selectively in Mcl-1-dependent but not Bcl-2-dependent K562 cells through selective Mcl-1 down-regulation, and synergistically enhanced apoptosis in combination with ABT-737. Moreover, the intraperitoneal administration of KS18 (10 mg/kg/d) and ABT-737 (20 mg/kg/d) significantly suppressed the growth of ABT-737-resistant HL-60 xenografts in nude mice without apparent toxicity. Overall, we identified the pharmacophore of pyoluteorin derivatives that act as potent and promising Mcl-1 antagonists against Mcl-1-dependent hematological cancers.","['Doi, Kenichiro', 'Gowda, Krishne', 'Liu, Qiang', 'Lin, Jyh-Ming', 'Sung, Shen-Shu', 'Dower, Christopher', 'Claxton, David', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Amin, Shantu', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Doi K', 'Gowda K', 'Liu Q', 'Lin JM', 'Sung SS', 'Dower C', 'Claxton D', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Amin S', 'Wang HG']","['a Department of Pediatrics ; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine ; Hershey , PA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC4623387,['NOTNLM'],"['ABTR, ABT-737 resistant', 'AML, Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'AUCinf, area under curve extrapolated to time infinity', 'AUClast, area under curve until last observed timepoint', 'Apoptosis', 'BH3, Bcl-2 homology domain 3', 'Bcl-2 family', 'Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2', 'CHX, Cycloheximide', 'CL, rate of plasma clearance', 'Cmax, maximal plasma concentration', 'EC50, Half maximal effective concentration', 'IRES, Internal ribosome entry site', 'LD50, median lethal dose', 'MTD, Maximal tolerated dose', 'Mcl-1', 'Mcl-1, Myeloid cell leukemia-1', 'NMR, Nuclear magnetic resonance', 'PARP, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase', 'SAR, Structure-activity relationship', 'T1/2, plasma half-life', 'Tmax, time to maximal plasma concentration', 'VD, Volume of distribution', 'i.p., Intraperitoneal', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'maritoclax', 'multiple myeloma', 'pyoluteorin']",2014/12/24 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384047.2014.972799 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2014;15(12):1688-99. doi: 10.4161/15384047.2014.972799.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phenols/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (marinopyrrole A)', '0 (pyoluteorin)']",,,"['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH R01-GM103893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH/NIDDK T32-DK007066/PHS HHS/United States', 'NIH R01-DK085121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK050306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we studied the ability of MSCs to support the growth and survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in vitro. Primary leukemic blasts isolated from the peripheral blood of 8 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were co-cultured with equal numbers of irradiated MSCs derived from unrelated donor bone marrow, with or without cytokines for up to 6weeks. Four samples showed CD34(+)CD38(-) predominance, and four were predominantly CD34(+)CD38(+). CD34(+) CD38(-) predominant leukemia cells maintained the CD34(+) CD38(-) phenotype and were viable for 6weeks when co-cultured with MSCs compared to co-cultures with cytokines or medium only, which showed rapid differentiation and loss of the LSC phenotype. In contrast, CD34(+) CD38(+) predominant leukemic cells maintained the CD34(+)CD38(+) phenotype when co-cultured with MSCs alone, but no culture conditions supported survival beyond 4weeks. Cell cycle analysis showed that MSCs maintained a higher proportion of CD34(+) blasts in G0 than leukemic cells cultured with cytokines. AML blasts maintained in culture with MSCs for up to 6weeks engrafted NSG mice with the same efficiency as their non-cultured counterparts, and the original karyotype persisted after co-culture. Chemosensitivity and transwell assays suggest that MSCs provide pro-survival benefits to leukemic blasts through cell-cell contact. We conclude that MSCs support long-term maintenance of LSCs in vitro. This simple and inexpensive approach will facilitate basic investigation of LSCs and enable screening of novel therapeutic agents targeting LSCs.","['Ito, Sawa', 'Barrett, A John', 'Dutra, Amalia', 'Pak, Evgenia', 'Miner, Samantha', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Hensel, Nancy F', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Muranski, Pawel', 'Liu, Paul', 'Larochelle, Andre', 'Melenhorst, J Joseph']","['Ito S', 'Barrett AJ', 'Dutra A', 'Pak E', 'Miner S', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Hensel NF', 'Rezvani K', 'Muranski P', 'Liu P', 'Larochelle A', 'Melenhorst JJ']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Cytogenetics and Microscopy Core, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Cytogenetics and Microscopy Core, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141206,England,Stem Cell Res,Stem cell research,101316957,PMC4634876,,,2014/12/24 06:00,2015/09/26 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.scr.2014.11.007 [doi]', 'S1873-5061(14)00143-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Res. 2015 Jan;14(1):95-104. doi: 10.1016/j.scr.2014.11.007.

We analyzed trends in the incidence of CML and patient survival in France. All cases recorded in five population-based registries between 1980 and 2009 were included. European (ESR) and world (WSR) standardized incidence rates as well as relative survival (RS) rates were estimated. We analyzed data for 781 patients (9863/3: 13.6%; 9875/3: 82.2%; 9876/3: 4.2%). ESR was 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-1.11] and WSR was 0.81 [95% CI = 0.72-0.90]. The five RS rates among patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML were 43.7% [30.9-61.9] when diagnosed in 1980-1986, 63.8% [56.9-71.5] in 1987-1999 and 88.7% [84.5-93.0] in 2000-2009.

Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) acts as a regulator of cellular energy metabolism and functions to regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. We hypothesize that LKB1 contributes to the deregulation of fetal or bone hematopoiesis caused by the benzene metabolite hydroquinone (HQ). To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared the effects of HQ on murine fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (FL-HSCs) and bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs). FL-HSCs and BM-HSCs were isolated and enriched by a magnetic cell sorting system and exposed to various concentrations of HQ (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 muM) for 24 h. We found that the inhibition of differentiation and growth, as well as the apoptosis rate of FL-HSCs, induced by HQ were consistent with the changes in BM-HSCs. Furthermore, G1 cell cycle arrest was observed in BM-HSCs and FL-HSCs in response to HQ. Importantly, FL-HSCs were more sensitive than BM-HSCs after exposure to HQ. The highest induction of LKB1 and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was observed with a much lower concentration of HQ in FL-HSCs than in BM-HSCs. LKB1 may play a critical role in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HQ-treated HSCs. This research has developed innovative ideas concerning benzene-induced hematopoietic toxicity or embryotoxicity, which can provide a new experimental evidence for preventing childhood leukemia.

The synthesized PMIDA-CoO NPs were characterized by XRD, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Our results showed that exposure of leukemic cell lines to PMIDA-CoO NPs caused reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by increasing the concentration of free Co(++) ions in cancer microenvironment. But at physiological pH, PMIDA-CoO liberates little amount of Co(++) ions into media and exerts lower toxicity to normal cells up to a certain dose. PMIDA-CoO NPs caused DNA damage in leukemic cell lines, which was reflected by an increase in apoptosis of jurkat, KG-1A and K562 cells. PMIDA-CoO NPs induced apoptosis by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, primarily TNF-alpha. The in vivo study shows that PMIDA-CoO NPs were efficiently killed DLA cells. These findings have important implications for understanding the potential anticancer property induced by surface-modified cobalt oxide nanoparticles.","['Chattopadhyay, Sourav', 'Dash, Sandeep Kumar', 'Tripathy, Satyajit', 'Pramanik, Panchanan', 'Roy, Somenath']","['Chattopadhyay S', 'Dash SK', 'Tripathy S', 'Pramanik P', 'Roy S']","['Department of Human Physiology with Community Health, Immunology and Microbiology Laboratory, Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, West Bengal, 721 102, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141223,Germany,J Biol Inorg Chem,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,9616326,,,,2014/12/24 06:00,2015/09/15 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00775-014-1221-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biol Inorg Chem. 2015 Jan;20(1):123-41. doi: 10.1007/s00775-014-1221-7.

As physical activity is beneficial against NASH, we analyzed the voluntary physical activity (VPA) and endurance training (ET) (preventive and therapeutic strategies) effects on hepatic insulin, pro-inflammatory and glucocorticoid signaling regulators/mediators in high-fat (Lieber-DeCarli) diet (HFD)-induced NASH. MAIN METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in standard diet (SD) or HFD, with sedentary, VPA and ET animals in both diet regimens. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were analyzed; plasma insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was calculated. Hepatic insulin, pro-inflammatory and glucocorticoid signaling regulators/mediators were evaluated by Western blot or reverse transcriptase-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: ET improved ISI in both diet regimens. HFD-feeding increased interleukin-1beta and induced a similar pattern on interleukin-6 and TGF-beta, which were globally reduced by physical exercise. ET decreased HFD leukemia inhibitory factor level, SD+VPA animals presenting higher values than HFD+VPA animals. HFD increased the ratio of IRS-1(Ser307)/total IRS-1, which was completely mitigated by physical exercise. Physical exercise reduced total ERK and JNK (total and activated) expression in HFD. In SD vs. HFD, VPA presented higher activated JNK and ET presented higher total JNK. Generally, in HFD, the ratio (activated/total) of AKT, and each separately, decreased with exercise and also for activated AKT in SD. Overall, in both diets, exercise reduced 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. ET increased glucocorticoid receptor and reduced PTP1B in HFD. SIGNIFICANCE: Physical exercise mitigates the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and positively modulates insulin and glucocorticoid signaling in NASH.","['Passos, E', 'Pereira, C D', 'Goncalves, I O', 'Rocha-Rodrigues, S', 'Silva, N', 'Guimaraes, J T', 'Neves, D', 'Ascensao, A', 'Magalhaes, J', 'Martins, M J']","['Passos E', 'Pereira CD', 'Goncalves IO', 'Rocha-Rodrigues S', 'Silva N', 'Guimaraes JT', 'Neves D', 'Ascensao A', 'Magalhaes J', 'Martins MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; Research Centre in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure, Faculty of Sport, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.

Because immune modulation plays a significant role in sustaining clinical remission after RIC, we hypothesize that higher graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with PB transplantation may offer a survival advantage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary outcome evaluated was overall survival. Cox regression models were built to study outcomes after transplantation of PB (n = 887) relative to BM (n = 219) for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the three most common indications for unrelated RIC transplantation. Transplantations were performed in the United States between 2000 and 2008. Conditioning regimens consisted of an alkylating agent and fludarabine, and GVHD prophylaxis involved a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) with either methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). RESULTS: After adjusting for age, performance score, donor-recipient HLA-match, disease, and disease status at transplantation (factors associated with overall survival), there were no significant differences in 5-year rates of survival after transplantation of PB compared with BM: 34% versus 38% with CNI-MTX and 27% versus 20% with CNI-MMF GVHD prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Survival after transplantation of PB and BM are comparable in the setting of nonirradiation RIC regimens for hematologic malignancy. The effect of GVHD prophylaxis on survival merits further evaluation.","['Eapen, Mary', 'Logan, Brent R', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Zhong, Xiaobo', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Eapen M', 'Logan BR', 'Horowitz MM', 'Zhong X', 'Perales MA', 'Lee SJ', 'Rocha V', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Champlin RE']","['Mary Eapen, Brent R.

First-generation adjuvant chemotherapy trials reported a 0.27% 8-year cumulative incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia. Incomplete ascertainment and follow-up may have underestimated subsequent risk of treatment-associated marrow neoplasm (MN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the MN frequency in 20,063 patients with stage I to III breast cancer treated at US academic centers between 1998 and 2007. Time-to-event analyses were censored at first date of new cancer event, last contact date, or death and considered competing risks. Cumulative incidence, hazard ratios (HRs), and comparisons with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results estimates were obtained. Marrow cytogenetics data were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty patients developed MN (myeloid, n = 42; lymphoid, n = 8) after breast cancer (median follow-up, 5.1 years). Patients who developed MN had similar breast cancer stage distribution, race, and chemotherapy exposure but were older compared with patients who did not develop MN (median age, 59.1 v 53.9 years, respectively; P = .03). Two thirds of patients had complex MN cytogenetics. Risk of MN was significantly increased after surgery plus chemotherapy (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 36.1) or after all modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation; HR, 7.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 35.8), compared with no treatment with chemotherapy. MN rates per 1,000 person-years were 0.16 (surgery), 0.43 (plus radiation), 0.46 (plus chemotherapy), and 0.54 (all three modalities). Cumulative incidence of MN doubled between years 5 and 10 (0.24% to 0.48%); 9% of patients were alive at 10 years. CONCLUSION: In this large early-stage breast cancer cohort, MN risk after radiation and/or adjuvant chemotherapy was low but higher than previously described. Risk continued to increase beyond 5 years. Individual risk of MN must be balanced against the absolute survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.","['Wolff, Antonio C', 'Blackford, Amanda L', 'Visvanathan, Kala', 'Rugo, Hope S', 'Moy, Beverly', 'Goldstein, Lori J', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith', 'Neumayer, Leigh', 'Langbaum, Terry S', 'Theriault, Richard L', 'Hughes, Melissa E', 'Weeks, Jane C', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Wolff AC', 'Blackford AL', 'Visvanathan K', 'Rugo HS', 'Moy B', 'Goldstein LJ', 'Stockerl-Goldstein K', 'Neumayer L', 'Langbaum TS', 'Theriault RL', 'Hughes ME', 'Weeks JC', 'Karp JE']","['Antonio C.

We have previously shown that C/EBPalpha-K304_R323dup belonging to C/EBPalpha-C(m), but not C/EBPalpha-T60fsX159 belonging to C/EBPalpha-N(m), alone induced AML in mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models. Here we show that various C/EBPalpha-C(m) mutations have a similar, but not identical, potential in myeloid leukemogenesis. Notably, like C/EBPalpha-K304_R323dup, any type of C/EBPalpha-C(m) tested (C/EBPalpha-S299_K304dup, K313dup, or N321D) by itself induced AML, albeit with different latencies after BMT; C/EBPalpha-N321D induced AML with the shortest latency. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of C/EBPalpha-N321D- and mock-transduced c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells, we identified Csf1r as a gene downregulated by C/EBPalpha-N321D. In addition, leukemic cells expressing C/EBPalpha-C(m) exhibited low levels of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor in mice. On the other hand, transduction with C/EBPalpha-N(m) did not influence Csf1r expression in c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)Lin(-) cells, implying a unique role for C/EBPalpha-C(m) in downregulating Csf1r. Importantly, Csf1r overexpression collaborated with C/EBPalpha-N321D to induce fulminant AML with leukocytosis in mouse BMT models to a greater extent than did C/EBPalpha-N321D alone. Collectively, these results suggest that C/EBPalpha-C(m)-mediated downregulation of Csf1r has a negative, rather than a positive, impact on the progression of AML involving C/EBPalpha-C(m), which might possibly be accelerated by additional genetic and/or epigenetic alterations inducing Csf1r upregulation.","['Togami, Katsuhiro', 'Kitaura, Jiro', 'Uchida, Tomoyuki', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Nishimura, Koutarou', 'Kawabata, Kimihito C', 'Nagase, Reina', 'Horikawa, Sayuri', 'Izawa, Kumi', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Nakahara, Fumio', 'Oki, Toshihiko', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Aburatani, Hiroyuki', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Togami K', 'Kitaura J', 'Uchida T', 'Inoue D', 'Nishimura K', 'Kawabata KC', 'Nagase R', 'Horikawa S', 'Izawa K', 'Fukuyama T', 'Nakahara F', 'Oki T', 'Harada Y', 'Harada H', 'Aburatani H', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Division of Stem Cell Signaling, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Division of Radiation Information Registry, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Division of Stem Cell Signaling, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

To study the role of LARP4B in AML, we established a LARP4B-knockdown MLL-AF9 AML mouse model. Using this mouse model, we found that LARP4B knockdown significantly decreased leukemia cells in the peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow and prolonged the survival of AML recipient mice. Additional studies showed that LARP4B knockdown reduced leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and impaired the self-renew capacity of LSCs. Cell cycle analysis revealed that LARP4B knockdown arrested more LSCs in the G0 phase. The transcription of the cell cycle inhibitors p16, p19, and p21 and of the lineage-specific transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha was increased in the LARP4B-knockdown LSCs. Thus, our results demonstrate that LARP4B plays an important role in the maintenance of LSCs and suggest that LARP4B may regulate the cell cycle of LSCs via suppressing the expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p16, p19, and p21 and the myeloid specific transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha.","['Zhang, Yingchi', 'Peng, Luyun', 'Hu, Tianyuan', 'Wan, Yang', 'Ren, Yuanyuan', 'Zhang, Jingliao', 'Wang, Xiaojuan', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Wang, Qianfei', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Zhu, Xiaofan']","['Zhang Y', 'Peng L', 'Hu T', 'Wan Y', 'Ren Y', 'Zhang J', 'Wang X', 'Zhou Y', 'Yuan W', 'Wang Q', 'Cheng T', 'Zhu X']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-ITD mutations result in a mislocalized and constitutively activated receptor, which aberrantly phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and upregulates the expression of its target genes. c-Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates RTKs, including FLT3, but whether it can downregulate mislocalized FLT3-ITD remains to be resolved. To help clarify this, we combined a FLT3-ITD mutation with a loss-of-function mutation in the RING finger domain of c-Cbl that abolishes its E3 ligase activity. Mice transplanted with hematopoietic stem cells expressing both mutations rapidly develop myeloid leukemia, indicating strong cooperation between the two. Although the c-Cbl mutation was shown to cause hyperactivation of another RTK, c-Kit, it had no effect on enhancing FLT3-ITD protein levels or STAT5 activation. This indicates that c-Cbl does not downregulate FLT3-ITD and that the leukemia is driven by independent pathways involving FLT3-ITD's activation of STAT5 and mutant c-Cbl's activation of other RTKs, such as c-Kit. This study highlights the importance of c-Cbl's negative regulation of wild-type RTKs in suppressing FLT3-ITD-driven myeloid leukemia.","['Taylor, Samuel J', 'Thien, Christine B F', 'Dagger, Samantha A', 'Duyvestyn, Johanna M', 'Grove, Carolyn S', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Langdon, Wallace Y']","['Taylor SJ', 'Thien CB', 'Dagger SA', 'Duyvestyn JM', 'Grove CS', 'Lee BH', 'Gilliland DG', 'Langdon WY']","['School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia; PathWest Division of Clinical Pathology, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 70 adolescents with leukemia. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MPSSS), and a demographical data form were used for data collection. RESULTS: Scores of the Global Severity Index, Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), and Positive Symptom Total (PST) of the BSI were higher than those of the healthy adolescents with the same age in other studies. There was a negative relationship between the MPSSS and negative self-image, depression, anxiety, PSDI, and PST of the BSI.

DATA SOURCES: Data cited in this review were obtained mainly from PubMed and Medline from 1993 to 2013 and highly regarded older publications were also included. The terms ""chronic neutrophilic leukemia"" and ""diagnosis"" were used for the literature search. STUDY SELECTION: We identified, retrieved and reviewed the information on the clinical and laboratory features, the new genetic findings, prognosis and disease evolution and management of CNL. RESULTS: The discovery of high-frequency granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R) mutations in CNL identifies a new major diagnostic criterion, and lends more specificity to the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for CNL, which are variably applied in routine clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: In patients for whom the cause of neutrophilia is not easily discerned, the incorporation of CSF3R mutation testing can be a useful point-of-care diagnostic to evaluate the presence of a clonal myeloid disorder, as well as providing the potential for genetically informed therapy. The oncogenic CSF3R mutations are molecular markers of sensitivity to inhibitors of the SRC family-TNK2 and JAK kinases and may provide a new avenue for therapy.","['Otgonbat, Altangerel', 'Zhao, Mingfeng']","['Otgonbat A', 'Zhao M']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, First Clinical College of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300192, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, First Clinical College of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300192, China.

Studies have shown that TIMP-2 has two roles in tumor invasion. However, its role in leukemic infiltration has not been well investigated. This study explored the roles of TIMP-2 in extramedullary infiltration of acute monocytic leukemic SHI-1 cells both in vitro and in vitro. METHODS: A retroviral vector carrying the human TIMP-2 cDNA was constructed and transfected into the monocytic leukemic cell line SHI-1. The expression of TIMP-2 in the positive clones was determined. The proliferation of SHI-1 cells was examined by MTT assay. Trans-Matrigel invasion assays were used to investigate the infiltration ability in vitro. SHI-1 cells were intravenously injected into pre-treated nu/nu mice to investigate the infiltration ability feature in vitro. RESULTS: The expression of TIMP-2 on the cell membrane was significantly elevated in SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells. Over-expression of TIMP-2 promoted the cells proliferation and the invasions in vitro. The SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells demonstrated higher infiltration ability when intravenously injected into nu/nu mice. CONCLUSION: Over-expression of TIMP-2, especially on the cell membrane, may play important roles in promoting the proliferation and infiltration of SHI-1 leukemic cells.","['Li, Zhenjiang', 'Chen, Zixing', 'Cen, Jiannong', 'He, Jun', 'Qiu, Qiaocheng', 'Xue, Yongquan']","['Li Z', 'Chen Z', 'Cen J', 'He J', 'Qiu Q', 'Xue Y']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.', 'Leukemia Research Unit, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215600, China.

SRSF2, one of components of the splicing machinery, has a high mutation frequency during chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, according to previous reports. However, the relevance of this finding in Chinese populations remains unknown. METHODS: We recruited 50 Chinese patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia to analyze the state of SRSF2 and to assess the corresponding clinical features by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Ten of 50 patients (20%) harbored SRSF2 mutations, including five P95R, two 95H, and three P95L point mutations. The patient group was older than the wild type group (P < 0.01). No significant statistical differences were observed with regard to the other clinical characteristics (sex, peripheral blood count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, karyotype, World Health Organization classification, etc.) between these two groups. Two of the patients showed an early evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: SRSF2 mutations are frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients, but show a relatively lower incidence in Chinese patients. Moreover, the mutation can be related to old age and an unfavorable prognosis. Our results provide valuable insights for the development of a diagnostic marker, or for the identification of a therapeutic target for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Sun, Chao', 'Zhang, Sujiang', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Yang, Xiangchou', 'Li, Jianyong']","['Sun C', 'Zhang S', 'Qiao C', 'Yang X', 'Li J']","[""Department of Hematology, Wuxi People's Hospital, Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214023, China."", 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,,,2014/12/24 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2014;127(24):4215-9.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors']","['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified a novel translocation, causing the fusion of the TRAF1 and ALK genes, in one patient who presented with a leukemic ALK+ ALCL (ALCL-11). To uncover the mechanisms leading to high-grade ALCL, we developed a human patient-derived tumorgraft (hPDT) line. Molecular characterization of primary and PDT cells demonstrated the activation of ALK and nuclear factor kB (NFkB) pathways. Genomic studies of ALCL-11 showed the TP53 loss and the in vivo subclonal expansion of lymphoma cells, lacking PRDM1/Blimp1 and carrying c-MYC gene amplification. The treatment with proteasome inhibitors of TRAF1-ALK cells led to the downregulation of p50/p52 and lymphoma growth inhibition. Moreover, a NFkB gene set classifier stratified ALCL in distinct subsets with different clinical outcome. Although a selective ALK inhibitor (CEP28122) resulted in a significant clinical response of hPDT mice, nevertheless the disease could not be eradicated. These data indicate that the activation of NFkB signaling contributes to the neoplastic phenotype of TRAF1-ALK ALCL. ALCL hPDTs are invaluable tools to validate the role of druggable molecules, predict therapeutic responses and implement patient specific therapies.","['Abate, F', 'Todaro, M', 'van der Krogt, J-A',

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a reverse transcription process, but the potential role of Mov10 in HBV replication remains unknown. In this study, Mov10 was demonstrated to affect HBV expression in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cell lines. The data showed that the over-expression of exogenous Mov10 resulted in an increase of the HBsAg and HBeAg levels in the culture supernatant and HBV mRNA level in transfected cells at a low dose and resulted in a decrease at a high dose, but HBV DNA in culture supernatant was not affected. The knockdown of endogenous Mov10 expression through siRNA treatment could suppress levels of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV mRNA, but had no effect on HBV DNA. Above results indicate that an appropriate level of exogenous Mov10 is responsible for HBV replication, that any perturbation in the level of Mov10 could affect HBV replication, while the endogenous Mov10 could promote HBV replication in vitro. The precise mechanisms that underlie the action of Mov10 on HBV still need further investigation.","['Ma, Yan-Xiu', 'Li, Di', 'Fu, Li-Juan', 'Fu, Bao-Qing', 'Chen, Si-Jia', 'Xu, Wei-Zhen', 'Teng, Xu', 'Song, Zhi-Wei', 'Gu, Hong-Xi']","['Ma YX', 'Li D', 'Fu LJ', 'Fu BQ', 'Chen SJ', 'Xu WZ', 'Teng X', 'Song ZW', 'Gu HX']","['The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'The Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Pathogenic Biology, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang Province, China.

Most MBL have the characteristic phenotype of chronic lymphocyte leukemia (chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-like MBL), and depending on the number of monoclonal B-cells, may characterize a preclinical stage of the CLL. However, there are also MBL with an atypical (CD5(+) CD20(+/bright) CD23(dim/-) ) or a CD5(neg) phenotype, which remain largely unexplored. We performed an extended immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and hematologic analysis in 75 CLL-like, 39 atypical, 50 CD5(neg) , and 7 biphenotypic MBL cases to detect differences or similarities among the MBL subsets. The phenotypic analysis showed expression variations in many surface markers and a wide spectrum of disease-specific phenotypes within each MBL subtype. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed a different panel of aberrations according to the phenotype. Overall, del(13q14) and +12 were the most common abnormalities (39%), whereas del(11q13), del(17p13), and del(6q23) were detected only in 3, 1, and 0 cases, respectively. A comparison of MBL with overt chronic lymphoproliferations revealed common aspects in the preclinical state, regarding both the kind of cytogenetic aberrations detected and the lymphocyte composition. Our findings highlight not only the heterogeneity among MBL subsets but also indicate common biologic features which differentiate MBL from clinical disease.","['Kostopoulos, Ioannis V', 'Paterakis, Georgios', 'Papadimitriou, Konstantinos', 'Pavlidis, Dimitrios', 'Tsitsilonis, Ourania E', 'Papadhimitriou, Stefanos I']","['Kostopoulos IV', 'Paterakis G', 'Papadimitriou K', 'Pavlidis D', 'Tsitsilonis OE', 'Papadhimitriou SI']","['Haematology Laboratory, ""G.

A connection between immunosurveillance and traffic of HP has been demonstrated, but the regulatory signals that instruct the immune regulation of HP circulation are unknown. We discovered that the BM microenvironment deficiency of p62, an autophagy regulator and signal organizer, results in loss of autophagic repression of macrophage contact-dependent activation of Ob NF-kappaB signaling. Consequently, Ob p62-deficient mice lose bone, Ob Ccl4 expression, and HP chemotaxis toward Cxcl12, resulting in egress of short-term hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. Finally, Ccl4 expression and myeloid progenitor egress are reversed by deficiency of the p62 PB1-binding partner Nbr1.

Studies of limb and fin regeneration in teleost fish and urodeles have shown the involvement of a number of locally activated signals at the wounded site during regeneration. Here, we demonstrate that a diffusible signal from a distance also play an essential role for regeneration. Among a number of zebrafish mutants, we found that the zebrafish cloche (clo) and tal1 mutants, which lack most hematopoietic tissues, displayed a unique regeneration defect accompanying apoptosis in primed regenerative tissue. Our analyses of the mutants showed that the cells in the primed regenerative tissue are susceptible to apoptosis, but their survival is normally supported by the presence of hematopoietic tissues, mainly the myeloid cells.

In this study, we report that the expression of miR-486-5p is increased in ML-DS compared with non-DS acute megakaryocytic leukemias (AMKLs). miR-486-5p is regulated by GATA1 and GATA1s that bind to the promoter of its host gene ANK1. miR-486-5p is highly expressed in mouse erythroid precursors and knockdown (KD) in ML-DS cells reduced their erythroid phenotype. Ectopic expression and KD of miR-486-5p in primary fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors demonstrated that miR-486-5p cooperates with Gata1s to enhance their self renewal. Consistent with its activation of AKT, overexpression and KD experiments showed its importance for growth and survival of human leukemic cells. Thus, miR-486-5p cooperates with GATA1s in supporting the growth and survival, and the aberrant erythroid phenotype of the megakaryocytic leukemias of DS.","['Shaham, Lital', 'Vendramini, Elena', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Goren, Yaron', 'Birger, Yehudit', 'Tijssen, Marloes R', 'McNulty, Maureen', 'Geron, Ifat', 'Schwartzman, Omer', 'Goldberg, Liat', 'Chou, Stella T', 'Pitman, Holly', 'Weiss, Mitchell J', 'Michaeli, Shulamit', 'Sredni, Benjamin', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Crispino, John D', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Shaham L', 'Vendramini E', 'Ge Y', 'Goren Y', 'Birger Y', 'Tijssen MR', 'McNulty M', 'Geron I', 'Schwartzman O', 'Goldberg L', 'Chou ST', 'Pitman H', 'Weiss MJ', 'Michaeli S', 'Sredni B', 'Gottgens B', 'Crispino JD', 'Taub JW', 'Izraeli S']","['Childhood Leukemia Research Institute, Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel;', 'Childhood Leukemia Research Institute, Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel;', 'Department of Oncology, Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI;', 'Rosetta Genomics Ltd, Rehovot, Israel;', 'Childhood Leukemia Research Institute, Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel;', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL;', 'Childhood Leukemia Research Institute, Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel;', 'Childhood Leukemia Research Institute, Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel;', 'Childhood Leukemia Research Institute, Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel;', ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA;"", 'Department of Oncology, Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI;', ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA;"", 'Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Institute of Nanotechnology & Advanced Materials, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel; and.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel;', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL;', ""Department of Oncology, Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI; Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI."", 'Childhood Leukemia Research Institute, Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141222,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4335082,,,2014/12/24 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/12/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35247-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-581892 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 19;125(8):1292-301. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-581892.

The central events leading up to GvHD were characterized in three phases which includes the tissue damage-phase, the T cell priming-phase and the effector-phase, when the disease becomes clinically overt. The role of individual cytokines, chemokines, transcription factor or receptors was studied in these models by using gene deficient or transgenic mice in the donor or recipient compartments. Besides, numerous studies have been performed in these models to prevent or treat GvHD. Several recent clinical trials were all based on previously reported findings from the mouse model of GvHD such as the trials on CCR5-blockade, donor statin treatment, vorinostat treatment or adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells for GvHD prevention.

Therefore, the search for new drugs or alternative therapy strategies has been required. Anticancer agents have been developed from plants since the 1950s and natural products still represent an important source of new and promising bioactive molecules. This work describes the cytotoxic effects of SF5 on tumor cells of high prevalence in the world and investigated some mechanisms of its antitumor action. The antitumor screening was performed with human lung carcinoma (A549), human breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3) adenocarcinoma and chronic myeloid and acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines. The acute lymphocytic leukemia Jurkat cells presented high sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of SF5 (inhibition of 85-90%), compared with either the chronic myeloid leukemia K562 or solid tumor cell lines (lung, breast and prostate). SF5 arrested the cell cycle in G1 phase, which may be related with the observed downregulation of mRNA expression of c-Myc transcription factor at 24 h and 36 h. SF5 treatment induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol, leading the Jurkat cells into apoptosis, which was evidenced by the internucleosomal fragmented DNA and increased number of annexin V-FITC positive cells. The SF5 showed high cytotoxicity for lymphocytic leukemia cells and low or none for solid tumor cells, without toxicity for peripheral mononuclear cells of healthy humans.

Mutations within its C-terminal domain are frequently observed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), are thought to play a key role in the initiation of the disease, and result in aberrant, cytoplasmic localization of the mutant protein. We have previously shown that the electrophilic antiproliferative natural product (+)-avrainvillamide (1) binds to proteins, including nucleophosmin, by S-alkylation of cysteine residues. Here, we report that avrainvillamide restores nucleolar localization of certain AML-associated mutant forms of NPM1 and provide evidence that this relocalization is mediated by interactions of avrainvillamide with mutant NPM1 and exportin-1 (Crm1). Immunofluorescence and mass spectrometric experiments employing a series of different NPM1 constructs suggest that a specific interaction between avrainvillamide and Cys275 of certain NPM1 mutants mediates the relocalization of these proteins to the nucleolus. Avrainvillamide treatment is also shown to inhibit nuclear export of Crm1 cargo proteins, including AML-associated NPM1 mutants. We also observe that avrainvillamide treatment displaces Thr199-phosphorylated NPM1 from duplicated centrosomes, leads to an accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes, and inhibits dephosphorylation of Thr199-phosphorylated NPM1 by protein phosphatase 1. Avrainvillamide is the first small molecule reported to relocalize specific cytoplasmic AML-associated NPM1 mutants to the nucleolus, providing an important demonstration of principle that small molecule induction of a wild-type NPM1 localization phenotype is feasible in certain human cancer cells.","['Mukherjee, Herschel', 'Chan, Kok-Ping', 'Andresen, Vibeke', 'Hanley, Mariah L', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Myers, Andrew G']","['Mukherjee H', 'Chan KP', 'Andresen V', 'Hanley ML', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Myers AG']","['daggerDepartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States.', 'double daggerCentre for Cancer Biomarkers, CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States.', 'double daggerCentre for Cancer Biomarkers, CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'section signDepartment of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150105,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,PMC4652655,,,2014/12/23 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb500872g [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2015 Mar 20;10(3):855-63. doi: 10.1021/cb500872g.

This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemic effects of thymoquinone on WEHI-3 cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cytotoxic effect of thymoquinone was assessed using an MTT assay, while the inhibitory effect of thymoquinone on murine WEHI-3 cell growth was due to the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by chromatin condensation dye, Hoechst 33342 and acridine orange/propidium iodide fluorescent staining. In addition, Annexin V staining for early apoptosis was performed using flowcytometric analysis. Apoptosis was found to be associated with the cell cycle arrest at the S phase. Expression of Bax, Bcl2 and HSP 70 proteins were observed by western blotting. The effects of thymoquinone on BALB/c mice injected with WEHI-3 cells were indicated by the decrease in the body, spleen and liver weights of the animal, as compared to the control. CONCLUSION: Thymoquinone promoted natural killer cell activities. This compound showed high toxicity against WEHI-3 cell line which was confirmed by an increase of the early apoptosis, followed by up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl2, and down-regulation of the apoptotic protein, Bax. On the other hand, high reduction of the spleen and liver weight, and significant histopathology study of spleen and liver confirmed that thymoquinone inhibited WEHI-3 growth in the BALB/c mice. Results from this study highlight the potential of thymoquinone to be developed as an anti-leukemic agent.","['Salim, Landa Zeenelabdin Ali', 'Othman, Rozana', 'Abdulla, Mahmood Ameen', 'Al-Jashamy, Karim', 'Ali, Hapipah Mohd', 'Hassandarvish, Pouya', 'Dehghan, Firouzeh', 'Ibrahim, Mohamed Yousif', 'Omer, Fatima Abd Elmutaal Ahmed', 'Mohan, Syam']","['Salim LZ', 'Othman R', 'Abdulla MA', 'Al-Jashamy K', 'Ali HM', 'Hassandarvish P', 'Dehghan F', 'Ibrahim MY', 'Omer FA', 'Mohan S']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Center for Natural Products and Drug Discovery (CENAR), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Center for Natural Products and Drug Discovery (CENAR), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, SEGi University, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Center for Natural Products and Drug Discovery (CENAR), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Medical Research Centre, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141222,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4274020,,,2014/12/23 06:00,2015/08/27 06:00,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0115340 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-31970 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 22;9(12):e115340. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115340. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/anatomy & histology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nigella sativa/chemistry/metabolism', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Spleen/anatomy & histology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",['PLoS One. 2015;10(3):e0120034.

It has been associated with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Soluble TLR2 (sTLR2) variants have been identified in human body fluids, and the TLR2 ectodomain can negatively regulate TLR2 activation by behaving as a decoy receptor. sTLR2 generation does not involve alternative splicing mechanisms, indicating that this process might involve a post-translational modification of the full-length receptor; however, the specific mechanism has not been studied. Using CD14+ peripheral human monocytes and the THP-1 monocytic leukemia-derived cell line, we confirm that sTLR2 generation increases upon treatment with pro-inflammatory agents and requires a post-translational mechanism. We also find that the constitutive and ligand-induced release of sTLR2 is sensitive to pharmacological metalloproteinase activator and inhibitors leading us to conclude that metalloproteinase TLR2 shedding contributes to soluble receptor production. By expressing human TLR2 in ADAM10- or ADAM17-deficient MEF cells, we find both enzymes to be implicated in TLR2 ectodomain shedding. Moreover, using a deletion mutant of the TLR2 juxtamembrane region, we demonstrate that this domain is required for sTLR2 generation. Functional analysis suggests that sTLR2 generated by metalloproteinase activation inhibitsTLR2-induced cytokine production by this monocytic leukemia-derived cell line. The identification of the mechanisms involved in regulating the availability of soluble TLR2 ectodomain and cell surface receptors may contribute further research on TLR2-mediated processes in innate immunity and inflammatory disorders.","['Langjahr, Patricia', 'Diaz-Jimenez, David', 'De la Fuente, Marjorie', 'Rubio, Estefhany', 'Golenbock, Douglas', 'Bronfman, Francisca C', 'Quera, Rodrigo', 'Gonzalez, Maria-Julieta', 'Hermoso, Marcela A']","['Langjahr P', 'Diaz-Jimenez D', 'De la Fuente M', 'Rubio E', 'Golenbock D', 'Bronfman FC', 'Quera R', 'Gonzalez MJ', 'Hermoso MA']","['Disciplinary Program of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Disciplinary Program of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Disciplinary Program of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Disciplinary Program of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases & Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.', 'Physiology Department, Millennium Nucleus in Regenerative Biology (MINREB), Faculty of Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Gastroenterology Unit, Clinica Las Condes, Santiago, Chile.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Biomedical Sciences Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Disciplinary Program of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141222,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4273945,,,2014/12/23 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2013/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0104624 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-43901 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 22;9(12):e104624. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0104624. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['ADAM Proteins/metabolism', 'ADAM10 Protein', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis', 'Ligands', 'Lipopeptides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Metalloproteases/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Solubility', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*biosynthesis/*chemistry/metabolism']","['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Pam(3)CSK(4) peptide)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS/METHODS: Cytotoxic effect of tested drugs, as well as induction of apoptosis, drop in Deltapsim and expression of selected proteins involved in regulation of apoptosis were assessed in 48 hour cultures containing autologous serum (AS) using flow cytometry. BENDA was used at the concentration of 40 mug/ml and RIT at the concentration of 10 mug/ml. Control cultures were incubated without drugs. RESULTS: BENDA used either alone or in combination with RIT strongly induced apoptosis as well as enhanced expression of selected apoptotic proteins, especially those involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway: P53, PUMA and BAX, which cause mitochondrial transmembrane potential changes leading to activation of caspase-9 and -3. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that both BENDA and RIT participate in the induction of apoptosis of CLL lymphocytes in vitro in the presence of AS in the culture medium. The drug-induced apoptosis occurs mainly via intrinsic pathway and activation of P53 and PUMA proteins, however the extrinsic pathway is likely to be involved as well.

The efficacy of methotrexate is often limited by mucositis and intestinal injury, which are major causes of morbidity in children and adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of olmesartan (OLM), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on an Intestinal Mucositis Model (IMM) induced by MTX in Wistar rats. IMM was induced via intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of MTX (7 mg/kg) for three consecutive days. The animals were pre-treated with oral OLM at 0.5, 1 or 5 mg/kg or with vehicle 30 min prior to exposure to MTX. Small intestinal homogenates were assayed for levels of the IL-1beta, IL-10 and TNF-alpha cytokines, malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase activity. Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses of MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, RANK/RANKL and SOCS-1 and confocal microscopy analysis of SOCS-1 expression were performed. Treatment with MTX + OLM (5 mg/kg) resulted in a reduction of mucosal inflammatory infiltration, ulcerations, vasodilatation and haemorrhagic areas (p<0.05) as well as reduced concentrations of MPO (p<0.001) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta (p<0.001) and TNF-a (p<0.01), and increase anti-inflammatory cytocine IL-10 (p<0.05). Additionally, the combined treatment reduced expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, RANK and RANKL(p<0.05) and increased cytoplasmic expression of SOCS-1 (p<0.05). Our findings confirm the involvement of OLM in reducing the inflammatory response through increased immunosuppressive signalling in an IMM.

Transcription of the HOX and CDX genes decreases during normal myelopoiesis, but is aberrantly sustained in leukemias with translocation or partial tandem duplication of the MLL1 gene. Cdx4 activates transcription of the HOXA9 and HOXA10 genes, and HoxA10 activates CDX4 transcription. The events that break this feedback loop, permitting a decreased Cdx4 expression during normal myelopoiesis, were previously undefined. In the current study, we find that HoxA9 represses CDX4 transcription in differentiating myeloid cells, antagonizing activation by HoxA10. We determine that tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 impairs transcriptional activation of CDX4, but tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA9 facilitates repression of this gene. As HoxA9 and HoxA10 are phosphorylated during myelopoiesis, this provides a mechanism for differentiation stage-specific Cdx4 expression. HoxA9 and HoxA10 are increased in cells expressing Mll-Ell, a leukemia-associated MLL1 fusion protein. We find that Mll-Ell induces a HoxA10-dependent increase in Cdx4 expression in myeloid progenitor cells. However, Cdx4 decreases in a HoxA9-dependent manner on exposure of Mll-Ell-expressing cells to differentiating cytokines. Leukemia-associated, constitutively active mutants of Shp2 block cytokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA9 and HoxA10. In comparison with myeloid progenitor cells that are expressing Mll-Ell alone, we find increased CDX4 transcription and Cdx4 expression in cells co-expressing Mll-Ell plus constitutively active Shp2. Increased Cdx4 expression is sustained on exposure of these cells to differentiating cytokines. Our results identify a mechanism for increased and sustained CDX4 transcription in leukemias co-overexpressing HoxA9 and HoxA10 in combination with constitutive activation of Shp2. This is clinically relevant, because MLL1 translocations and constitutive Shp2 activation co-exist in human myeloid leukemias.","['Bei, L', 'Shah, C', 'Wang, H', 'Huang, W', 'Platanias, L C', 'Eklund, E A']","['Bei L', 'Shah C', 'Wang H', 'Huang W', 'Platanias LC', 'Eklund EA']","['Department of Medicine, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', '1] Department of Medicine, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA [2] The Robert H.

It is the most stable epigenetic mark and is widely studied for its role in major biological processes. Aberrant DNA methylation is observed in various pathologies, such as cancer. Therefore, there is a great interest in analyzing subtle changes in DNA methylation induced by biological processes or upon drug treatments. Here, we developed an improved methodology based on flow cytometry to measure variations of DNA methylation level in melanoma and leukemia cells. The accuracy of DNA methylation quantification was validated with LC-ESI mass spectrometry analysis. The new protocol was used to detect small variations of cytosine methylation occurring in individual cells during their cell cycle and those induced by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzadC). Kinetic experiments confirmed that inheritance of DNA methylation occurs efficiently in S phase and revealed a short delay between DNA replication and completion of cytosine methylation. In addition, this study suggests that the uncoupling of 5AzadC effects on DNA demethylation and cell proliferation might be related to the duration of the DNA replication phase.","['Desjobert, Cecile', 'El Mai, Mounir', 'Gerard-Hirne, Tom', ""Guianvarc'h, Dominique"", 'Carrier, Arnaud', 'Pottier, Cyrielle', 'Arimondo, Paola B', 'Riond, Joelle']","['Desjobert C', 'El Mai M', 'Gerard-Hirne T', ""Guianvarc'h D"", 'Carrier A', 'Pottier C', 'Arimondo PB', 'Riond J']","['a CNRS - Pierre Fabre USR 3388 ETaC; CRDPF BP12562 ; Toulouse , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150123,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,PMC4622670,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azadeoxycytidine', ""5AzadC, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine"", '5mC, 5-methylcytosine', 'AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'CGI, CpG island', 'DNA methylation', 'DNMT, DNA methyltransferase', 'FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting', 'LC-ESI MS/MS, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass', 'spectrometry', 'MDS, myelodysplastic syndromes', 'cancer', 'cell cycle', 'flow cytometry']",2014/12/23 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15592294.2014.995542 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2015;10(1):82-91. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2014.995542.

IKKvarepsilon and TBK1 are two IKK-related kinases that allow the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors that trigger IFN type I gene expression. We observed that IKKvarepsilon and TBK1 recruit Tax into cellular immunocomplexes. We also found that TRAF3, which regulates cell receptor signaling effectors, forms complexes with Tax. Transactivation analyses revealed that expression of Tax, in presence of IKKvarepsilon and TBK1, enhances IFN-beta promoter activity, whereas the activation of NF-kappaB promoter is not modified.

Its physiopathology comprehends the production of inflammatory mediators by differentiating granulocytes, endothelial and alveolar cells due to stimulation by all-trans retinoic acid and leading to sustained systemic inflammation. METHODS: Treatment with high cut-off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (HCO-CVVHD) was performed to reduce the circulating mediators of systemic inflammation. RESULTS: After 52 h of treatment, an important reduction was observed in inflammatory mediators (IL-1beta: from 10 to 2 pg/ml; IL-8: from 57 to 40 pg/ml; TNF-alpha: from 200 to 105 pg/ml; IL-6: from 263 to 91 pg/ml), as well as in anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10: from 349 to 216 pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: HCO-CVVHD should be explored as a part of treatment in systemic inflammation states other than sepsis (e.g., differentiation syndrome). Furthermore, its immunomodulatory effects could be particularly useful in immunocompromised patient treated with corticosteroids.","['Villa, Gianluca', 'Zaragoza, Jose J', 'Sharma, Aashish', 'Chelazzi, Cosimo', 'Ronco, Claudio', 'De Gaudio, A Raffaele']","['Villa G', 'Zaragoza JJ', 'Sharma A', 'Chelazzi C', 'Ronco C', 'De Gaudio AR']","['International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza, Vicenza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20141219,Switzerland,Blood Purif,Blood purification,8402040,,,,2014/12/23 06:00,2015/10/28 06:00,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000369379 [pii]', '10.1159/000369379 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Purif. 2014;38(3-4):234-8. doi: 10.1159/000369379.

We report a novel chemical strategy for selective FLT3 inhibition while avoiding KIT inhibition with the staurosporine analog, Star 27. Star 27 maintains potency against FLT3 in proliferation assays of FLT3-transformed cells compared with KIT-transformed cells, shows no toxicity towards normal human hematopoiesis at concentrations that inhibit primary FLT3-mutant AML blast growth, and is active against mutations that confer resistance to clinical inhibitors.

Management of these symptoms in patients with hematologic cancer presents significant challenges, as many of them are in and out of the hospital while undergoing high dose chemotherapy. Oncology patients use complementary modalities such as therapeutic massage in an attempt to alleviate disease and treatment-related symptoms, including anxiety and emotional distress. In the current study, the feasibility of a novel massage intervention delivered over the continuum of care, as well as assessment of the immediate and cumulative effects of massage, was examined in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. METHODS: A mixed-methods, unmasked, prospective, randomized study was conducted with two groups: a usual care alone control group and a massage therapy intervention plus usual care group. RESULTS: Significant improvements in levels of stress and health-related quality of life were observed in the massage therapy group versus the usual care alone group, after adjusting for anxiety level, including both immediate and cumulative effects of massage. CONCLUSIONS: While the findings of the current study regarding acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of therapeutic massage as a complementary health-enhancing intervention in patients diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia are very promising, the relatively small size of the study sample limits generalizability.","['Taylor, Ann Gill', 'Snyder, Audrey E', 'Anderson, Joel G', 'Brown, Cynthia J', 'Densmore, John J', 'Bourguignon, Cheryl']","['Taylor AG', 'Snyder AE', 'Anderson JG', 'Brown CJ', 'Densmore JJ', 'Bourguignon C']","['Center for the Study of Complementary and Alternative Therapies, University of Virginia School of Nursing, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'University of Virginia School of Nursing, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Center for the Study of Complementary and Alternative Therapies, University of Virginia School of Nursing, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'University of West Georgia School of Nursing, Carrollton, Georgia, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Medical Center, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Center for the Study of Complementary and Alternative Therapies, University of Virginia School of Nursing, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Trials,Journal of clinical trials,101588094,PMC4266937,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'Complementary and alternative medicine', 'Complementary health-enhancing approaches', 'Integrative medicine', 'Therapeutic massage']",2014/12/23 06:00,2014/12/23 06:01,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4172/2167-0870.1000161 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Trials. 2014;4. doi: 10.4172/2167-0870.1000161.,,,,,,,"['K07 AT002943/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'K30 AT000060/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA100627/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AT000052/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS597751'],,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the success of IM and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains largely incurable, and a number of CML patients die due to Abl mutation-related drug resistance and blast crisis. 3, 5-Dihydroxy-6, 7, 3'4'-tetramethoxyflavone (DHTMF) is a polymethoxyflavone isolated from Laggera pterodonta which is a herbal medicine used to treat cancer in the Chinese folk. In the previous study, we found DHTMF demonstrated good antiproliferative activities against a number of cancer cell lines and induced the apoptosis of CNE cells in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner while exhibiting low cytotoxicity in the two normal cell lines Vero and EVC304. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induced by DHTMF alone and in combination with IM in the IM-resistant CML cell line K562R. METHODS: Cell proliferation was assayed with the cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) method. The apoptosis percentage was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was detected using FCM and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The level of proteins involved in apoptosis was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: DHTMF suppressed K562R cell viability in both time- and dose-dependent manners. DHTMF combined with IM enhanced the inhibitory effects and apoptosis in K562R cells as compared with DHTMF alone. DHTMF alone and in combination with IM significantly decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and increased the levels of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-7, caspase-3, and PARP in K562R cells. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that DHTMF could inhibit IM-resistant K562R cell proliferation and induces apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These results suggest that DHTMF may be a potential therapeutic drug with lower side effects against IM resistance in CML cells.","['Cao, Changshu', 'Liu, Bailian', 'Zeng, Chengwu', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Li, Bo', 'Li, Yaolan', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Cao C', 'Liu B', 'Zeng C', 'Lu Y', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Li B', 'Li Y', 'Li Y']","['Department of Human Anatomy, Medical School of Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China ; Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine & Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine & Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China ; Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141205,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC4272561,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cell proliferation', 'DHTMF', 'Imatinib-resistant K562 cells']",2014/12/23 06:00,2014/12/23 06:01,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-014-0137-1 [doi]', '137 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2014 Dec 5;14(1):137. doi: 10.1186/s12935-014-0137-1. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the predictive significance of ARS2 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unknown. Here we evaluate the predictive values of ARS2 expression and combined ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expression in relapse. We showed that ARS2 expression in ALL bone marrow samples at initial diagnosis was markedly lower than that in complete remission (CR). Likewise, the levels of ARS2 expression in the patients suffering from relapse were significantly lower than that of patients in continuous CR. Furthermore, low expression of ARS2 was closely correlated to poor treatment response including poor prednisone response and high minimal residual disease (MRD), and the patients with high MRD (>/=10(-4)) and low ARS2 were more subject to relapse. The multivariate analyses for relapse free survival and event free survival revealed that ARS2 expression remained an independent prognostic factor after adjusting other risk factors. In addition, combined assessment of ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expression was more accurate to predict relapse, based on which an algorithm composed of ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expression, prednisone response and MRD (day 78) was proposed. Together, ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expressions can precisely predict high-risk of relapse and ALL prognosis.","['Cui, Lei', 'Gao, Chao', 'Zhang, Rui-Dong', 'Jiao, Ying', 'Li, Wei-Jing', 'Zhao, Xiao-Xi', 'Liu, Shu-Guang', 'Yue, Zhi-Xia', 'Zheng, Hu-Yong', 'Deng, Guo-Ren', 'Wu, Min-Yuan', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Jia, Hong-Ti']","['Cui L', 'Gao C', 'Zhang RD', 'Jiao Y', 'Li WJ', 'Zhao XX', 'Liu SG', 'Yue ZX', 'Zheng HY', 'Deng GR', 'Wu MY', 'Li ZG', 'Jia HT']","[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

Polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was conducted in rs2271189 and rs2292239 genotyping. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed in rs2271189 allele distribution between RA patients and controls (P = 0.029, odds ratio: 1.460, 95% confidence interval: 1.040-2.050). CONCLUSION: As far as we know, this is the first study which correlates ERBB3 gene with RA susceptibility, adding to a previous report of chromosome 12q13 association with RA liability. Furthermore, we confirmed that polymorphism rs2271189 can predict better ERBB3 gene association with disorders than the previously reported ERBB3 variants.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study over a period of 21 years, from 1984 to 2004, including all cases of ocular cancer, histologically proven after surgery of the globe or the orbit. For each patient, we studied the following parameters: age, sex, reason(s) for consultation, the affected eye, and histological result of the operative specimen. These data were collected by studying the departmental surgical registry, patient medical records and the tumor registry of the anatomicopathology laboratory of a tertiary care hospital in sub-Saharan Africa. RESULTS: We collected data on 111 black patients, among whom 15 cases (13.5%) presented with bilateral involvement, for a total of 126 eyes. The sex ratio was 1.17. Presenting signs showed a predominance of leukocoria (30.2%) followed by proptosis (21.7%) and in third place, protruding conjunctival mass (10.8%). Retinoblastoma was found most frequently, representing 66.6% of the oculo-orbital tumors and 95.45% of the tumors of the globe; followed by epidermoid carcinoma, representing 15.08% of cases. Malignant melanoma was third most common, representing 4.76%, with 83% arising in the anterior uvea and 7% in the choroid. Basal cell carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma follow in fourth place. Basal cell carcinoma constituted half (50%) of the eyelid tumors. Rhabdomyosarcoma was the most common orbital tumor in our series (57%). Next were lymphomas with conjunctival localization (2.38%), acute leukemia with orbital localization (1.59%) and rare tumors, palpebral dermatofibrosarcoma (0.79%), an orbital angiosarcoma (0.79%), a glioblastoma of the globe (0.79%) and a malignant solitary fibrous tumor of the orbit (0.79%). CONCLUSION: Ocular and orbital primary cancers in blacks remain tumors of the young, equally distributed between the sexes. Retinoblastoma is the most frequent, followed by epidermoid carcinoma. The globe is the preferential localization of these cancers.","['Seck, S M', 'Agboton, G', 'Gueye, N N', 'Diop, J', 'Seck, C M', 'Lam, A']","['Seck SM', 'Agboton G', 'Gueye NN', 'Diop J', 'Seck CM', 'Lam A']","['Service ophtalmologie, hopital principal de Dakar, 1, avenue Nelson-Mandela, BP 3006, Dakar, Senegal.

Fifty-two patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP were enrolled in this study and received 100 mg dasatinib once daily. A deep molecular response (DMR) was defined as <50 copies/mug RNA of BCR-ABL1 transcript value corrected by GAPDH, which ensures <0.01% of BCR-ABL1 transcript value according to International Scale (BCR-ABL1(IS)). The halving time for BCR-ABL1 transcripts was calculated using transcript levels before dasatinib treatment, transcript levels after 3 months of treatment, and the treatment time between these two points. In terms of molecular response, 38 of 51 (75%) patients reached major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months, and the rate of DMR by 18 months was 59% (30/51). While both BCR-ABL1 transcript levels before treatment and a shorter halving time of BCR-ABL1 transcripts (</=14 days) were significant factors affecting achievement of MMR by 12 months, the Sokal score at diagnosis was not associated with MMR. Importantly, the halving time was the only factor that predicted achievement of DMR by 18 months. We showed that patients with CML-CP treated with dasatinib can be stratified according to the early treatment response as determined by the halving time of BCR-ABL1 transcripts. These data emphasize the significance of the early response from dasatinib treatment in achieving a DMR.

Rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene are found in acute myeloid leukemia associated with poor prognosis. The upregulation of Hox genes is critical for LSC induction and maintenance, but is unlikely to support malignancy and the high LSC frequency observed in MLL leukemias. The present study shows that MLL fusion proteins interact with the transcription factor PU.1 to activate the transcription of CSF-1R, which is critical for LSC activity. Acute myeloid leukemia is cured by either deletion of PU.1 or ablation of cells expressing CSF-1R. Kinase inhibitors specific for CSF-1R prolong survival time. These findings indicate that PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF-1R is a critical effector of MLL leukemogenesis.","['Aikawa, Yukiko', 'Yamagata, Kazutsune', 'Katsumoto, Takuo', 'Shima, Yutaka', 'Shino, Mika', 'Stanley, E Richard', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Kitabayashi, Issay']","['Aikawa Y', 'Yamagata K', 'Katsumoto T', 'Shima Y', 'Shino M', 'Stanley ER', 'Cleary ML', 'Akashi K', 'Tenen DG', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150212,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC4373983,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CSF-1R', 'Spi-1', 'mixed lineage leukemia', 'stem cells']",2014/12/23 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12593 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 Mar;106(3):227-36. doi: 10.1111/cas.12593.

Tauhis support is mediated through the local cytokine network and by direct cellcell interactions mediated via adhesion molecules and the formation of gap junctions by connexins. Previous studies on connexins in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have mainly focused on the investigation of leukemia cell lines. In the present study, we therefore investigated the expression of various connexins at the protein (i.e., cell surface expression) and mRNA level in primary human AML cells. The cell surface expression of the connexins, Cx26, Cx32, Cx37, Cx43 and Cx45, varied considerably between patients, and detectable levels were observed only for subsets of patients. On the whole, Cx43 and Cx45 showed the highest cell surface expression. Connexin expression was dependent on AML cell differentiation, but showed no association with cytogenetic abnormalities or mutations of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) or nucleophosmin (NPM)1 genes. By contrast, only Cx45 showed a significant variation between patients at the mRNA level. A high Cx45 expression was associated with the altered regulation of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferongamma], whereas a low Cx45 expression was associated with the altered regulation of protein functions (i.e., ligase activity, protein folding and catabolism). There was no significant correlation observed between the connexin mRNA and protein levels. Thus, differences in connexin expression can be used to subclassify AML patients. Differences in connexin cell surface expression profiles are not reflected at the mRNA level and have to be directly examined, whereas variations in Cx45 mRNA expression are associated with differences in cell signaling and the regulation of protein functions.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Saeterdal, Lars Rune', 'Nepstad, Ina', 'Foss, Brynjar', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Ryningen A', 'Saeterdal LR', 'Nepstad I', 'Foss B', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Health Studies, University of Stavanger, Stravanger, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Health Studies, University of Stavanger, Stravanger, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141219,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,PMC4314410,,,2014/12/23 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2014/12/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2014.2045 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2015 Mar;35(3):645-52. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2014.2045.

The use of doxorubicin is, however, associated with severe cardiotoxicity, often resulting in early discontinuation of the treatment. Importantly, the toxic symptoms can occur several years after the termination of the doxorubicin administration. In this study, the toxic effects of doxorubicin exposure have been investigated in cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC). The cells were exposed to different concentrations of doxorubicin for up to 2 days, followed by a 12 day recovery period. Notably, the cell morphology was altered during drug treatment and the cells showed a reduced contractile ability, most prominent at the highest concentration of doxorubicin at the later time points. A general cytotoxic response measured as Lactate dehydrogenase leakage was observed after 2 days' exposure compared to the vehicle control, but this response was absent during the recovery period. A similar dose-dependant pattern was observed for the release of cardiac specific troponin T (cTnT) after 1 day and 2 days of treatment with doxorubicin. Global transcriptional profiles in the cells revealed clusters of genes that were differentially expressed during doxorubicin exposure, a pattern that in some cases was sustained even throughout the recovery period, suggesting that these genes could be used as sensitive biomarkers for doxorubicin-induced toxicity in human cardiomyocytes. The results from this study show that cTnT release can be used as a measurement of acute cardiotoxicity due to doxorubicin. However, for the late onset of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, cTnT release might not be the most optimal biomarker. As an alternative, some of the genes that we identified as differentially expressed after doxorubicin exposure could serve as more relevant biomarkers, and may also help to explain the cellular mechanisms behind the late onset apoptosis associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.","['Holmgren, Gustav', 'Synnergren, Jane', 'Bogestal, Yalda', 'Ameen, Caroline', 'Akesson, Karolina', 'Holmgren, Sandra', 'Lindahl, Anders', 'Sartipy, Peter']","['Holmgren G', 'Synnergren J', 'Bogestal Y', 'Ameen C', 'Akesson K', 'Holmgren S', 'Lindahl A', 'Sartipy P']","['Systems Biology Research Center, School of Bioscience, University of Skovde, Box 408, Kanikegrand 3A, SE-541 28 Skovde, Sweden; Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, SE-413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.

Here, we report on a large series of patients with MDS (N = 631) transplanted either with mobilized peripheral stem cells (PBs) from unrelated donors (n = 502) or with umbilical cord blood transplant (UCB, n = 129) as alternative grafts after reduced-intensity conditioning. Neutrophil engraftment was higher after PB (98% versus 78%, P < .0001). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was similar after PB (31%) and UCB (29%), and chronic GVHD incidence was higher after PB (41% versus 23%). Two-year nonrelapse mortality was lower after PB (31% versus 42% P = .03). There was a better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after PB (49% +/- 2% versus 30% +/- 4%, P < .0001 and 44% +/- 2% versus 28% +/- 4%, P < .0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the advantage of PB for treatment-related mortality, OS, and DFS, whereas relative risk of chronic GVHD was similar. A multivariate analysis comparing PB from a 10/10 HLA-matched donor, PB from a 9/10 HLA-matched donor, and UCB showed an advantage on treatment-related mortality, DFS, and OS only in 10/10 PB. We conclude that in MDS patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling donor, PB from a 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor is the preferred source of hematopoietic stem cells. HLA-mismatched unrelated donor or cord blood seem to give similar inferior results except for neutrophil engraftment, which is delayed after UCB.","['Robin, Marie', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Tabrizi, Reza', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Koenecke, Christian', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Maillard, Natacha', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Russel, Nigel', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'de Witte, Theo M', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Robin M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Labopin M', 'Niederwieser D', 'Tabrizi R', 'Sanz G', 'Bourhis JH', 'van Biezen A', 'Koenecke C', 'Blaise D', 'Tischer J', 'Craddock C', 'Maillard N', 'Mohty M', 'Russel N', 'Schetelig J', 'Finke J', 'Gluckman E', 'de Witte TM', 'Rocha V', 'Kroger N']","['Hematology-Bone Marrow Transplantation, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.

Binding sites of KLF1 are often found near binding sites of GATA-1 and TAL1. In the beta-globin locus, KLF1 is required for forming active chromatin structure, although its role is unclear. To explore the role of KLF1 in transcribing the human gamma-globin genes, we stably reduced the expression of KLF1 in erythroid K562 cells, compromising its association in the beta-globin locus. The gamma-globin transcription was reduced with disappearance of active chromatin structure of the locus in the KLF1 knockdown cells. Interestingly, GATA-1 and TAL1 binding was reduced in the beta-globin locus, even though their expressions were not affected by KLF1 knockdown. The KLF1-dependent GATA-1 and TAL1 binding was observed in the adult locus transcribing the beta-globin gene and in several erythroid genes, where GATA-1 occupancy is independent from TAL1. These results indicate that KLF1 plays a role in facilitating and/or stabilizing GATA-1 and TAL1 occupancy in the erythroid genes, contributing to the generation of active chromatin structure such as histone acetylation and chromatin looping.","['Kang, Yujin', 'Kim, Yea Woon', 'Yun, Jangmi', 'Shin, Jongo', 'Kim, AeRi']","['Kang Y', 'Kim YW', 'Yun J', 'Shin J', 'Kim A']","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.

We sought to validate this risk score in an independent CIBMTR cohort of 1128 patients with CGVHD who underwent transplantation between 2005 and 2007 using the same inclusion criteria and risk score calculations. According to the sum of the overall risk score (range, 1 to 12), patients were assigned to 4 risk groups (RGs): RG1 (0 to 2), RG2 (3 to 6), RG3 (7 to 8), and RG4 (9 to 10). RG3 and RG4 were combined, as RG4 accounted for only 1% of the total cohort. Cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and probability of overall survival were significantly different between each RG (all P < .01). NRM and overall survival at 5 years after CGVHD for each RG were 17% and 72% in RG1, 26% and 53% in RG2, and 44% and 25% in RG3, respectively (all P < .01). Our study validates the prognostic value of the CIBMTR CGVHD RGs for overall survival and NRM in a contemporary transplantation population. The CIBMTR CGVHD RGs can be used to predict major outcomes, tailor treatment planning, and enroll patients in clinical trials.","['Arora, Mukta', 'Hemmer, Michael T', 'Ahn, Kwang Woo', 'Klein, John P', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Couriel, Daniel R', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Li, Peigang', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Bolwell, Brian J', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Isola, Luis M', 'Jacobsohn, David A', 'Jagasia, Madan', 'Klumpp, Thomas R', 'Petersdorf, Effie W', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Wingard, John R', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Pavletic, Steven Z', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Flowers, Mary E D']","['Arora M', 'Hemmer MT', 'Ahn KW', 'Klein JP', 'Cutler CS', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Couriel DR', 'Alousi AM', 'Gale RP', 'Inamoto Y', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Li P', 'Antin JH', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Cahn JY', 'Cairo MS', 'Isola LM', 'Jacobsohn DA', 'Jagasia M', 'Klumpp TR', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Santarone S', 'Schouten HC', 'Wingard JR', 'Spellman SR', 'Pavletic SZ', 'Lee SJ', 'Horowitz MM', 'Flowers ME']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplantation Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplantation Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Divison of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplantation Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Divison of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, and Institute of Research Josep Carreras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematology Research Centre, Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplantation Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Leukemia Program, Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Medicine, Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York.', ""Divison of Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Medicine, Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Hematology, Ospedale Civile BMT Center, Pescara, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Academische Ziekenhuis Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Shands Cancer Center & University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplantation Research, National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplantation Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data on TE appearance in 63 APL patients. RESULTS: TE occured in 13 (20.6%) cases, four arterial (6.3%) and nine venous (14.3%). TE were more frequently diagnosed after initiation of weekly D-dimer monitoring (7 TE during 20 months vs 6 during 76 months, P=0.032). Patients with and without venous thrombosis were significantly different regarding female/male ratio (P=0.046), PT (P=0.022), aPTT (P=0.044), ISTH DIC score (P=0.001), bcr3 (P=0.02) and FLT3-ITD (P=0.028) mutation. The most significant risk factor for venous TE occurrence in multivariate analysis was FLT3-ITD mutation (P=0.034). PAI-1 4G/4G polymorphism was five times more frequent in patients with venous TE than without it (P=0.05). Regarding risk factors for arterial TE we failed to identify any. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that APL-related TE rate is higher than previously reported and that weekly D-dimer monitoring might help to identify patients with silent thrombosis. Moreover, our study suggests a possible relationship between venous TE occurrence and several laboratory findings (PT, aPTT, ISTH DIC score, bcr3 isoform, FLT3-ITD mutation and PAI 4G/4G). Prophylactic use of heparin might be considered in patients with ISTH DIC score<5, bcr3 isoform, FLT3-ITD mutation and PAI 4G/4G.","['Mitrovic, Mirjana', 'Suvajdzic, Nada', 'Elezovic, Ivo', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija', 'Djordjevic, Valentina', 'Miljic, Predrag', 'Djunic, Irena', 'Gvozdenov, Maja', 'Colovic, Natasa', 'Virijevic, Marijana', 'Lekovic, Danijela', 'Vidovic, Ana', 'Tomin, Dragica']","['Mitrovic M', 'Suvajdzic N', 'Elezovic I', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Djordjevic V', 'Miljic P', 'Djunic I', 'Gvozdenov M', 'Colovic N', 'Virijevic M', 'Lekovic D', 'Vidovic A', 'Tomin D']","['Clinic of Hematology CCS, Belgrade, Koste Todorovica 2 Serbia.

The purpose of the current study was to benchmark ex vivo the sensitivity of GC tumor cells from patients to standard cytotoxic and some newly introduced targeted drugs (TDs), as a basis for drug selection in the treatment of GC. METHODS: Tumor cell samples from patients with GC were analyzed for sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, mitomycin C, doxorubicin and docetaxel as well as for the targeted drugs bortezomib, sorafenib, sunitinib and rapamycin using a short-term in vitro assay based on retention of viable tumor cells of fluorescent fluorescein. Samples of normal mononuclear cells, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer were included for comparison. RESULTS: The GC samples were essentially as sensitive to the standard drugs and the TDs as those from colorectal cancer whereas the ovarian cancer samples were more sensitive. The individual GC samples varied considerably in sensitivity to increasing concentrations of the clinically used standard drugs. In GC, cisplatin was cross-resistant to oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil which, on the other hand, was not cross-resistant to the other cytotoxic drugs. The activity of sunitinib did not obviously correlate to that of the standard drugs. CONCLUSION: Ex vivo assessment of drug sensitivity of tumor cells from patients with GC is feasible and may provide information that could be useful for selection of drugs for treatment. Drug sensitivity varies considerably between and within individual samples arguing for individualized selection of drugs for chemotherapy.","['Hultman, Bo', 'Mahteme, Haile', 'Sundbom, Magnus', 'Ljungman, Martin', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Nygren, Peter']","['Hultman B', 'Mahteme H', 'Sundbom M', 'Ljungman M', 'Larsson R', 'Nygren P']","['Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. bo.hultman@ltdalarna.se.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. haile.mahteme@surgsci.uu.se.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. magnus.sundbom@surgsci.uu.se.', 'Surgery Department, Vastmanlands Hospital, SE-721 89, Vasteras, Sweden. martin.ljungman@ltvastmanland.se.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. rolf.larsson@medsci.uu.se.', 'Department of Radiology, Oncology and Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University, SE-751 85, Uppsala, Sweden. peter.nygren@medsci.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141221,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC4304126,,,2014/12/22 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-014-0110-9 [doi]', 's13046-014-0110-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Dec 21;33:110. doi: 10.1186/s13046-014-0110-9.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benchmarking/*standards', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*standards', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*standards', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*standards', '*Patient Selection', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia, acquired cytogenetic abnormalities are important independent predictors of initial response to therapy, remission duration, and overall survival. However, whether the presence of multiple cytogenetically characterized clones affects outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia is still not well defined. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of cytogenetic clonal heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukemia. This analysis included 1403 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients fit for intensive chemotherapy, aged between 15 and 88 years, enrolled on Southwest Oncology Group protocols. The presence of multiple cytogenetic clones was found in 164 (24%) patients with abnormal karyotype. The proportion of patients with clonal heterogeneity increased with age, being present in 20% of patients under 40 years of age, but in 30% of those aged over 70 years (P=0.03). Clonal heterogeneity was significantly more common in association with unfavorable karyotype. Clonal heterogeneity was associated with decreased response rates and inferior event-free, relapse-free and overall survival, and was confirmed as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in multivariable analysis. Subgroup analysis showed that clonal heterogeneity adds prognostic information particularly in the unfavorable karyotype group. Our results confirm the negative prognostic impact of clonal heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukemia patients with abnormal karyotype.

In multivariate analysis, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors given before allogeneic stem cell transplantation was associated with a better overall survival (HR=0.68; P=0.04) and was associated with lower relapse incidence (HR=0.5; P=0.01). In the post-transplant period, multivariate analysis identified prophylactic tyrosine-kinase inhibitor administration to be a significant factor for improved leukemia-free survival (HR=0.44; P=0.002) and overall survival (HR=0.42; P=0.004), and a lower relapse incidence (HR=0.40; P=0.01). Over the past decade, administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors before allogeneic stem cell transplantation has significantly improved the long-term allogeneic stem cell transplantation outcome of adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Prospective studies will be of great interest to further confirm the potential benefit of the prophylactic use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the post-transplant setting.","['Brissot, Eolia', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Beckers, Marielle M', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Lenhoff, Stig', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Craddock, Charles F', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Gurman, Gunhan', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Potter, Michael N', 'Nagler, Armon', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Brissot E', 'Labopin M', 'Beckers MM', 'Socie G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Volin L', 'Finke J', 'Lenhoff S', 'Kroger N', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Craddock CF', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Gurman G', 'Russell NH', 'Aljurf M', 'Potter MN', 'Nagler A', 'Ottmann O', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Esteve J', 'Mohty M']","[""Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France CHRU Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France."", ""Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France."", 'University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.', 'University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.', 'Lund University Hospital, Sweden.', 'University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK.', 'CHRU Lille, France.', 'Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Nottingham University Hospital, Nottingham, UK.', 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hasomer, Israel.', 'Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Erasmus Medical Center-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Hospital Clinic Institut d'investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France mohamad.mohty@inserm.fr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141219,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC4349279,,,2014/12/21 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2014/12/21 06:00'],"['2014/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.116954 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.116954 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Mar;100(3):392-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.116954.

AIM: To describe the use of goals of care discussions in patients with advanced/refractory cancer at risk for critical care interventions and evaluate associations between these discussions and outcomes. DESIGN: Cohort study describing patients/families' perceptions of goals of care meetings and comparing health care utilization outcomes of patients who did and did not have discussions. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Inpatient units of an academic cancer center. Included patients had metastatic solid tumors or relapsed/refractory lymphoma or leukemia and were at risk for critical care, defined as requiring supplemental oxygen and/or cardiac monitor. RESULTS: Of 86 patients enrolled, 34 (39%) had a reported goals of care discussion (study group). Patients/families reported their needs and goals were addressed moderately to quite a bit during the meetings. Patients in the study group were less likely to receive critical care (0% vs 22%, p = 0.003) and more likely to be discharged to hospice (48% vs 30%, p = 0.04) than the control group. Only one patient in the study group died during the index hospitalization (on comfort care) (3%) compared with 9(17%) in the control group (p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: Goals of care meetings for advanced/refractory cancer inpatients at risk for critical care interventions can address patient and family goals and needs and improve health care utilization. These meetings should be part of routine care for these patients.","['Apostol, Colleen C', 'Waldfogel, Julie M', 'Pfoh, Elizabeth R', 'List, Donald', 'Billing, Lynn S', 'Nesbit, Suzanne A', 'Dy, Sydney Morss']","['Apostol CC', 'Waldfogel JM', 'Pfoh ER', 'List D', 'Billing LS', 'Nesbit SA', 'Dy SM']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins (SKCCC), Baltimore, MD, USA apostco@jhmi.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Health Policy & Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Social Work, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins (SKCCC), Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Harry J.

However, despite this shared ability to inhibit fusion, IFITMs differ in the potency and breadth of viruses restricted, an anomaly that is not fully understood. Here, we show that differences in the range of viruses restricted by IFITM1 are regulated by a C-terminal non-canonical dibasic sorting signal KRXX that suppresses restriction of some viruses by governing its intracellular distribution. Replacing the two basic residues with alanine (KR/AA) increased restriction of jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus and 10A1 amphotropic murine leukemia virus. Deconvolution microscopy revealed an altered subcellular distribution for KR/AA, with fewer molecules in LAMP1-positive lysosomes balanced by increased levels in CD63-positive multivesicular bodies, where jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus pseudovirions are colocalized. IFITM1 binds to cellular adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), an association that is lost when the dibasic motif is altered. Although knockdown of AP-3 itself decreases some virus entry, expression of parental IFITM1, but not its KR/AA mutant, potentiates inhibition of viral infections in AP-3 knockdown cells. By using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we provide evidence that IFITM1 adopts more than one membrane topology co-existing in cellular membranes. Because the C-terminal dibasic sorting signal is unique to human IFITM1, our results provide novel insight into understanding the species- and virus-specific antiviral effect of IFITMs.","['Li, Kun', 'Jia, Rui', 'Li, Minghua', 'Zheng, Yi-Min', 'Miao, Chunhui', 'Yao, Yunfang', 'Ji, Hong-Long', 'Geng, Yunqi', 'Qiao, Wentao', 'Albritton, Lorraine M', 'Liang, Chen', 'Liu, Shan-Lu']","['Li K', 'Jia R', 'Li M', 'Zheng YM', 'Miao C', 'Yao Y', 'Ji HL', 'Geng Y', 'Qiao W', 'Albritton LM', 'Liang C', 'Liu SL']","['From the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211.', 'the Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (Ministry of Education) and Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics (Tianjin), College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'From the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211.', 'From the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211.', 'From the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211.', 'the Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (Ministry of Education) and Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics (Tianjin), College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'the Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Texas Lung Injury Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler, Texas 75708.', 'the Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (Ministry of Education) and Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics (Tianjin), College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'the Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology (Ministry of Education) and Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics (Tianjin), College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Biochemistry, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163.', 'the McGill AIDS Centre, Lady Davis Institute, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2, Canada, and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 2B4, Canada.', 'From the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211, liushan@missouri.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141219,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC4326833,['NOTNLM'],"['Adaptor Protein', 'Interferon', 'Intracellular Trafficking', 'Retrovirus', 'Virus Entry']",2014/12/21 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/12/21 06:00'],"['2014/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)47013-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.630780 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Feb 13;290(7):4248-59. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.630780.

As MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnks) are part of the convergent node of these two pathways, and play a pivotal role in cellular transformation, targeting Mnks has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy. Herein, a dual-specific Mnk1/2 inhibitor MNKI-57 and a potent Mnk2-specific inhibitor MNKI-4 were selected for a panel screen against 28 human cancer cell lines. The study reveals that MNKI-57 and MNKI-4 are most potent against leukemia cells KYO-1 (i.e. BC-CML) and KG-1 (i.e. AML). Interestingly, we found that sensitivity of selected leukemia cells to Mnk inhibitors is correlated with the level of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at Thr70. The anti-proliferative effects of Mnk inhibitors are cytostatic in the sensitive KYO-1 cells, inducing significant G1 arrest via down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. In KYO-1 cells where Akt is not constitutively active, Mnk inhibitors increase the sensitivity of cells to rapamycin, resulting in a more pronounced anti-proliferative activity. Remarkably, the synergistic anti-proliferative effects are associated with a marked de-phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr70. Collectively, these data highlight the importance of 4E-BP1 as a key integrator in the MAPK and mTORC1 cascades, and suggest that a combined pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1 and Mnk kinases offers an innovative therapeutic opportunity in BC-CML.","['Teo, Theodosia', 'Yu, Mingfeng', 'Yang, Yuchao', 'Gillam, Todd', 'Lam, Frankie', 'Sykes, Matthew J', 'Wang, Shudong']","['Teo T', 'Yu M', 'Yang Y', 'Gillam T', 'Lam F', 'Sykes MJ', 'Wang S']","['Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research and Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research and Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research and Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research and Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research and Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research and Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research and Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.

This study aims to evaluate whether SES is associated with survival from childhood leukemia. METHODS: The US National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) 1973-2010 data were analyzed; thereafter, results were meta-analyzed along with those from survival (cohort) studies examining the association between SES indices and survival from childhood leukemia (end-of-search date: 31 March 2014). Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled effect estimates (relative risks, RRs); meta-regression was also used. RESULTS: We included 29 studies yielding 28 804 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 3208 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 27 650 'any' leukemia (denoting joint reporting of all subtypes) cases. According to individual-level composite SES indices, children from low SES suffered from nearly twofold higher death rates from ALL (pooled RR: 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.00-3.34, based on four study arms); likewise, death RRs derived from an array of lower area-level SES indices ranged between 1.17 and 1.33 (based on 11 study arms). Importantly, the survival gap between higher and lower SES seemed wider in the United States, with considerably (by 20%-82%) increased RRs for death from ALL in lower SES. Regarding AML, poorer survival was evident only when area-level SES indices were used. Lastly, remoteness indices were not associated with survival from childhood leukemia. CONCLUSION: Children with lower SES suffering childhood leukemia do not seem to equally enjoy the impressive recent survival gains.

As some patients are unresponsive to imatinib, next generation BCR-ABL inhibitors such as nilotinib have been developed to treat patients with imatinib-resistant CML. The use of some BCR-ABL inhibitors has been associated with bleeding diathesis, and these inhibitors have been shown to inhibit platelet functions, which may explain the hemostasis impairment. Surprisingly, a new TKI, ponatinib, has been associated with a high incidence of severe acute ischemic cardiovascular events. The mechanism of this unexpected adverse effect remains undefined. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This study used biochemical and functional assays to evaluate whether ponatinib was different from the other BCR-ABL inhibitors with respect to platelet activation, spreading, and aggregation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that ponatinib, similar to other TKIs, acts as a platelet antagonist. Ponatinib inhibited platelet activation, spreading, granule secretion, and aggregation, likely through broad spectrum inhibition of platelet tyrosine kinase signaling, and also inhibited platelet aggregate formation in whole blood under shear. As our results indicate that pobatinib inhibits platelet function, the adverse cardiovascular events observed in patients taking ponatinib may be the result of the effect of ponatinib on other organs or cell types, or disease-specific processes, such as BCR-ABL+cells undergoing apoptosis in response to chemotherapy, or drug-induced adverse effects on the integrity of the vascular endothelium in ponatinib-treated patients.","['Loren, Cassandra P', 'Aslan, Joseph E', 'Rigg, Rachel A', 'Nowak, Marie S', 'Healy, Laura D', 'Gruber, Andras', 'Druker, Brian J', 'McCarty, Owen J T']","['Loren CP', 'Aslan JE', 'Rigg RA', 'Nowak MS', 'Healy LD', 'Gruber A', 'Druker BJ', 'McCarty OJ']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering; Department of Cell & Developmental Biology.

Although various methods for TP53 mutation analysis have been reported, none of them allow the identification of all occurring sequence variants, and the most suitable methodology is still being discussed. The aim of this study was to determine the limitations of commonly used methods for TP53 mutation examination in CLL and propose an optimal approach for their detection. We examined 182 CLL patients enriched for high-risk cases using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY), and the AmpliChip p53 Research Test in parallel. The presence of T53 gene mutations was also evaluated using ultra-deep next generation sequencing (NGS) in 69 patients. In total, 79 TP53 mutations in 57 (31 %) patients were found; among them, missense substitutions predominated (68 % of detected mutations). Comparing the efficacy of the methods used, DHPLC and FASAY both combined with direct Sanger sequencing achieved the best results, identifying 95 % and 93 % of TP53-mutated patients. Nevertheless, we showed that in CLL patients carrying low-proportion TP53 mutation, the more sensitive approach, e.g., ultra-deep NGS, might be more appropriate. TP53 gene analysis using DHPLC or FASAY is a suitable approach for mutation detection. Ultra-deep NGS has the potential to overcome shortcomings of methods currently used, allows the detection of minor proportion mutations, and represents thus a promising methodology for near future.","['Kantorova, Barbara', 'Malcikova, Jitka', 'Smardova, Jana', 'Pavlova, Sarka', 'Trbusek, Martin', 'Tom, Nikola', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Tichy, Boris', 'Truong, Sim', 'Diviskova, Eva', 'Kotaskova, Jana', 'Oltova, Alexandra', 'Patten, Nancy', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Pospisilova, Sarka']","['Kantorova B', 'Malcikova J', 'Smardova J', 'Pavlova S', 'Trbusek M', 'Tom N', 'Plevova K', 'Tichy B', 'Truong S', 'Diviskova E', 'Kotaskova J', 'Oltova A', 'Patten N', 'Brychtova Y', 'Doubek M', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S']","['Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University Brno, Kamenice 5, CZ-625 00, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141220,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,,,2014/12/21 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/12/21 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2971-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 May;36(5):3371-80. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2971-0.

In this study, using Jurkat cells, an acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line, we evaluated the effects of an NF-kappaB inhibitor and a JNK inhibitor individually and in combination on the proliferation, survival and clonogenic capacity of leukemic cells. We found that leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs) were more sensitive to NF-kappaB inhibitor treatment than were healthy hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), as shown by a reduction in the clonogenic capacity of the former. Inactivation of NF-kappaB leads to the activation of JNK signaling in both leukemic cells and healthy HSPCs. Interestingly, JNK inhibitor treatment enhanced the repressive effects of NF-kappaB inhibitor on LSPCs but prevented such repression in HSPCs. Our data suggest that JNK signaling stimulates proliferation/survival in LSPCs but is a death signal in HSPCs. The combination of NF-kappaB inhibitor and JNK inhibitor might provide a better treatment for T-ALL leukemia by synergistically killing LSPCs while simultaneously preventing the death of normal HPCs.","['Liu, Xinli', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Li, Jing', 'Volk, Andrew', 'Breslin, Peter', 'Zhang, Jiwang', 'Zhang, Zhou']","['Liu X', 'Zhang J', 'Li J', 'Volk A', 'Breslin P', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang Z']","[""Department of Biology, College of Life and Environment Science, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life and Environment Science, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life and Environment Science, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center and Departments of Pathology and Molecular/Cellular Physiology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, United States of America.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center and Departments of Pathology and Molecular/Cellular Physiology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, United States of America.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center and Departments of Pathology and Molecular/Cellular Physiology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, United States of America.', ""College of Life Science and Biopharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141219,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4272284,,,2014/12/20 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0115490 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-15662 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 19;9(12):e115490. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115490. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Anthracenes/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology']","['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sulfones)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principle of this method is mainly based on the competition of candidate drugs to the fluorescent probe-target complexes and the excellent capacity of FCS for sensitively distinguishing the free fluorescent probes and the fluorescent probe-target complexes in solution. In this study, the screening of protein kinase inhibitors was used as a model, tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 was used as a target and a known inhibitor dasatinib derivative labeled with a fluorescent dye was used as a fluorescent affinity probe. We firstly established the theoretical model of drug screening based on the binding process of fluorescent probes and targets, the competition of candidate drugs to the fluorescent probe-target complexes and FCS theory. Then, the dasatinib derivatives were synthesized and labeled with the fluorescent dye Alexa 488, and the binding and dissociation processes of Alexa 488-dasatinib and ABL1 were systematically investigated. The dissociation constant and the dissociation rate for the Alexa 488-dasatinib-ABL1 complex were determined. Finally, the established method was used to screen candidate drugs. The dissociation constants of ABL1 kinase to six known drugs for treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were evaluated and the results obtained are well consistent with the reported values. Furthermore, a homemade chip with micro-wells was successfully utilized in FCS measurements as the carrier of samples, and the sample requirements were only 1-2 muL in this case. Our results demonstrated that the drug screening method described here is universal, sensitive and shows small sample and reagent quantity requirements. We believe that this method will become a high throughput platform for screening of small molecule drugs.","['Ruan, Lingao', 'Su, Di', 'Shao, Chang', 'Wang, Jinjie', 'Dong, Chaoqing', 'Huang, Xiangyi', 'Ren, Jicun']","['Ruan L', 'Su D', 'Shao C', 'Wang J', 'Dong C', 'Huang X', 'Ren J']","[""College of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200240, People's Republic of China. huangxy@sjtu.edu.cn jicunren@sjtu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,,,,2014/12/20 06:00,2015/09/15 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4an01816h [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2015 Feb 21;140(4):1207-14. doi: 10.1039/c4an01816h.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*metabolism']","['0 (Alexa 488 hydrazide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cells are tightly controlled by a network of CDK inhibitors that govern proliferation and prevent stem cell exhaustion. Loss of Inca1 led to an increased number of short-term hematopoietic stem cells in older mice, but Inca1 seems largely dispensable for normal hematopoiesis. On the other hand, Inca1-deficiency enhanced cell cycling upon cytotoxic stress and accelerated bone marrow exhaustion. Moreover, AML1-ETO9a-induced proliferation was not sustained in Inca1-deficient cells in vivo. As a consequence, leukemia induction and leukemia maintenance were severely impaired in Inca1-/- bone marrow cells. The re-initiation of leukemia was also significantly inhibited in absence of Inca1-/- in MLL-AF9- and c-myc/BCL2-positive leukemia mouse models. These findings indicate distinct functional properties of Inca1 in normal hematopoietic cells compared to leukemia initiating cells. Such functional differences might be used to design specific therapy approaches in leukemia.","['Baumer, Nicole', 'Baumer, Sebastian', 'Berkenfeld, Frank', 'Stehling, Martin', 'Kohler, Gabriele', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Tschanter, Petra']","['Baumer N', 'Baumer S', 'Berkenfeld F', 'Stehling M', 'Kohler G', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Tschanter P']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology/Oncology, University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany; Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF), University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology/Oncology, University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology/Oncology, University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany; Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Department of Tissue Morphogenesis, and University of Muenster, Faculty of Medicine, Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Department of Tissue Morphogenesis, and University of Muenster, Faculty of Medicine, Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, Clinical Center Fulda, 36043 Fulda, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology/Oncology, University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology/Oncology, University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany; Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF), University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany; Dept. of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, 06120 Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology/Oncology, University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany; Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF), University of Muenster, 48129 Muenster, Germany; Dept. of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, 06120 Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141219,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4272264,,,2014/12/20 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0115578 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-42650 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 19;9(12):e115578. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115578. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Inca1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research in nanobiotechnology-based therapeutic alternatives has provided innovative and promising strategies to overcome MDR. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the new strategy of a co-loaded reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with shortened carbon nanotubes (CNTs) would show useful effects on the real-time reversal of tumor MDR. CNTs were cut and purified via ultrasonication and oxidative acid treatment to optimize their length for drug-delivery vehicles, then verapamil (Ver) and doxorubicin (Dox) were co-loaded on shortened CNTs (denoted as Ver/Dox/shortened CNTs), which acted as a drug delivery system. The multidrug resistant leukemia K562/A02 cells were treated with the denoted Ver/Dox/shortened CNTs. The real-time reversal of tumor MDR were evaluated by flow cytometer, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, and Western blot analysis. In the same MDR tumor cells the new strategy of a co-loaded reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with CNTs could inhibit the function of P-glycoprotein in real-time by Ver as reversal agent, significantly increase the uptake of Dox, enhance the sensitivity of the MDR cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent, and induce apoptosis. It was therefore concluded that a co-loaded reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with shortened CNTs could have real-time reversal ability of MDR in tumors, which could represent a promising approach in cancer therapy.","['Wu, Pingping', 'Li, Shang', 'Zhang, Haijun']","['Wu P', 'Li S', 'Zhang H']","[""Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141205,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,PMC4266246,['NOTNLM'],"['carbon nanotubes', 'drug delivery system', 'multidrug resistance', 'tumor']",2014/12/20 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S74962 [doi]', 'dddt-8-2431 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2014 Dec 5;8:2431-8. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S74962. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nanotubes, Carbon/*chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['0 (Nanotubes, Carbon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a viral infection activates the immune system's response that eradicates the pathogen mainly through inflammatory mechanisms, it is now recognized that this inflammatory condition is also favorable to the development of tumors. Indeed, it is well described that viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), human papillomavirus (HPV) or human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), are important risk factors for tumor malignancies. The inflammatory response is a fundamental immune mechanism which involves several molecular and cellular components consisting of cytokines and chemokines that are released by various proinflammatory cells. In parallel to this process, some endogenous recruited components release anti-inflammatory mediators to restore homeostasis. The development of tools and strategies using viruses to hijack the immune response is mostly linked to the presence of regulatory T-cells (Treg) that can inhibit inflammation and antiviral responses of other effector cells. In this review, we will focus on current understanding of the role of natural and induced Treg in the control and the resolution of inflammatory response in HCV-, HTLV-1-, and EBV-associated cancers.","['Ouaguia, Laurissa', 'Mrizak, Dhafer', 'Renaud, Sarah', 'Morales, Olivier', 'Delhem, Nadira']","['Ouaguia L', 'Mrizak D', 'Renaud S', 'Morales O', 'Delhem N']","['CNRS UMR 8161, Institut de Biologie de Lille, Universit Lille-Nord de France, SIRIC ONCOLille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, IFR142, 1 rue du Professeur Calmette, 59021 Lille Cedex, France.', 'CNRS UMR 8161, Institut de Biologie de Lille, Universit Lille-Nord de France, SIRIC ONCOLille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, IFR142, 1 rue du Professeur Calmette, 59021 Lille Cedex, France.', 'CNRS UMR 8161, Institut de Biologie de Lille, Universit Lille-Nord de France, SIRIC ONCOLille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, IFR142, 1 rue du Professeur Calmette, 59021 Lille Cedex, France.', 'CNRS UMR 8161, Institut de Biologie de Lille, Universit Lille-Nord de France, SIRIC ONCOLille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, IFR142, 1 rue du Professeur Calmette, 59021 Lille Cedex, France.', ""CNRS UMR 8161, Institut de Biologie de Lille, Universit Lille-Nord de France, SIRIC ONCOLille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, IFR142, 1 rue du Professeur Calmette, 59021 Lille Cedex, France ; UFR de Biologie, Universite de Lille 1, Cite Scientifique, Batiment SN3, 59655 Villeneuve d'Ascq Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141130,United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,PMC4267219,,,2014/12/20 06:00,2015/09/09 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/564296 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2014;2014:564296. doi: 10.1155/2014/564296.

Additionally, antemortem diagnosis of equine pancreatitis is difficult because of the lack of definitive diagnostic tests. Although a paucity of information exists on this entity in the horse, pancreatic disease has typically been shown to be secondary to other gastrointestinal, hepatic, and endocrine conditions. No predisposition based on age, sex, or breed appears to exist, but several conditions predispose a horse to pancreatitis, including grain overload, endocrine disease, and parasite migration. A retrospective search of cases within the archive of the University of Tennessee necropsy database revealed only 4 cases during a 9-year period (2005-2014). In only 1 case was pancreatic disease considered primary, and in the other 3, pathologies often seen concurrently with pancreatic lesions were identified. These included cecal rupture, colonic displacement, neoplasia (lymphocytic leukemia), and pituitary adenoma.

Here, we investigated whether circulating microparticles (MPs), which are small membrane vesicles released by apoptotic or activated cells, are physiological carriers of OSEs. OSEs on circulating MPs isolated from healthy donors and patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STE-MI) were characterized by flow cytometry using a panel of OSE-specific monoclonal antibodies. We found that a subset of MPs carry OSEs on their surface, predominantly malondialdehyde (MDA) epitopes. Consistent with this, a majority of IgM antibodies bound on the surface of circulating MPs were found to have specificity for MDA-modified LDL. Moreover, we show that MPs can stimulate THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) and human primary monocytes to produce interleukin 8, which can be inhibited by a monoclonal IgM with specificity for MDA epitopes. Finally, we show that MDA(+) MPs are elevated at the culprit lesion site of patients with STE-MI. Our results identify a subset of OSE(+) MPs that are bound by OxLDL-specific IgM. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which anti-OxLDL IgM antibodies could mediate protective functions in CVD.","['Tsiantoulas, Dimitrios', 'Perkmann, Thomas', 'Afonyushkin, Taras', 'Mangold, Andreas', 'Prohaska, Thomas A', 'Papac-Milicevic, Nikolina', 'Millischer, Vincent', 'Bartel, Caroline', 'Horkko, Sohvi', 'Boulanger, Chantal M', 'Tsimikas, Sotirios', 'Fischer, Michael B', 'Witztum, Joseph L', 'Lang, Irene M', 'Binder, Christoph J']","['Tsiantoulas D', 'Perkmann T', 'Afonyushkin T', 'Mangold A', 'Prohaska TA', 'Papac-Milicevic N', 'Millischer V', 'Bartel C', 'Horkko S', 'Boulanger CM', 'Tsimikas S', 'Fischer MB', 'Witztum JL', 'Lang IM', 'Binder CJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria Christian Doppler Laboratory for Innovative Therapy Approaches in Sepsis, Krems, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical Research Center and Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Diagnostics, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'INSERM U970, Paris Cardiovascular Research Center - PARCC, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Innovative Therapy Approaches in Sepsis, Krems, Austria Department of Blood Group Serology Transfusion Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria Christian Doppler Laboratory for Innovative Therapy Approaches in Sepsis, Krems, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141218,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,PMC4306697,['NOTNLM'],"['acute coronary syndrome', 'immunoglobulin M antibodies', 'malondialdehyde']",2014/12/20 06:00,2015/10/21 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2275(20)35628-5 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.P054569 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2015 Feb;56(2):440-8. doi: 10.1194/jlr.P054569.

METHODS: In a multicentre, single-arm, open-label phase 2 study, we enrolled adult patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-negative, primary refractory or relapsed (first relapse within 12 months of first remission, relapse within 12 months after allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation [HSCT], or no response to or relapse after first salvage therapy or beyond) leukaemia. Patients received blinatumomab (9 mug/day for the first 7 days and 28 mug/day thereafter) by continuous intravenous infusion over 4 weeks every 6 weeks (up to five cycles), per protocol. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial haematological recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRh) within the first two cycles. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01466179. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 2012, and Oct 10, 2013, 189 patients were enrolled and treated with blinatumomab. After two cycles, 81 (43%, 95% CI 36-50) patients had achieved a CR or CRh: 63 (33%) patients had a CR and 18 (10%) patients had a CRh. 32 (40%) of patients who achieved CR/CRh underwent subsequent allogeneic HSCT. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were febrile neutropenia (48 patients, 25%), neutropenia (30 patients, 16%), and anaemia (27 patients, 14%). Three (2%) patients had grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. Neurologic events of worst grade 3 or 4 occurred in 20 (11%) and four (2%) patients, respectively. Three deaths (due to sepsis, Escherichia coli sepsis, and Candida infection) were thought to be treatment-related by the investigators. INTERPRETATION: Single-agent blinatumomab showed antileukaemia activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia characterised by negative prognostic factors. Further assessment of blinatumomab treatment earlier in the course of the disease and in combination with other treatment approaches is warranted.

This study aims to provide an update on the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole in the current US healthcare setting to reflect bioequivalent tablet formulations of posaconazole and fluconazole, as well as changes in healthcare and drug costs. METHODS: An existing model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole vs FLU/ITRA in the prevention of IFD among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Drug efficacy, mortality related to IFD, and death from other causes were estimated for tablet formulations using data from a randomized clinical trial of oral suspensions based on bioequivalence. IFD treatment costs were updated using the average inflation rate over 8 years (2006-2014) and drug costs were based on 2014 Analysource data. RESULTS: Trial data show a lower IFD probability over 100 days of follow-up with posaconazole compared to standard azole therapy (0.05 vs 0.11). The treatment duration on posaconazole is 29 days compared to 24 days for FLU and 29 days for ITRA. The average cost of prophylaxis is higher in the posaconazole group compared to FLU/ITRA ($4673 vs $353); however, the costs associated with treating the IFD are lower in the posaconazole group compared to FLU/ITRA ($2205 vs $5303). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of IFD avoided for posaconazole is $18,898 vs FLU/ITRA. CONCLUSIONS: In the current healthcare cost environment where both drug costs and overall IFD treatment costs have increased since 2007, posaconazole tablets are a cost-effective alternative to fluconazole or itraconazole in the prevention of IFD among neutropenic patients with AML and MDS in the US.","['Sung, Anita H', 'Marcella, Stephen W', 'Xie, Yang']","['Sung AH', 'Marcella SW', 'Xie Y']","['Merck & Co., Inc. , Lebanon, NJ , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150302,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cost-effectiveness', 'Decision analysis', 'Invasive fungal disease', 'Prophylaxis']",2014/12/20 06:00,2016/02/02 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3111/13696998.2014.1000460 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2015 May;18(5):341-8. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2014.1000460.

T-ALL accounts for ~15% of pediatric ALL cases and is prone to early relapse. With new and improved treatment protocols, the prognosis of T-ALL has improved particularly in children; however, the outcome of relapsed T-ALL cases remains poor. The AIOLOS gene is necessary to control lymphocyte differentiation and may be a potential target of T-ALL therapy. In the present study, Jurkat cells were divided into three groups: untransfected (UT) control, lentiviral vector control (Lenti-Mock) and AIOLOS-overexpressing (Lenti-AIOLOS) groups. Lenti-AIOLOS Jurkat cells were constructed by lentiviral transduction; cell cycle analysis, apoptosis and cytotoxicity assays were then performed to evaluate the effects of AIOLOS on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and cell chemosensitivity to etoposide of Jurkat cells in vitro. Moreover, the expression levels of genes associated with apoptosis and cell cycle were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that the percentage of Jurkat cells in the G0/G1 phase increased from 71.5 (UT) to 85.4% (Lenti-AIOLOS; P<0.05), yet the percentage of cells in the S-phase decreased from 15.1 (UT) to 11.6% (LentiAIOLOS; P<0.05). The percentage of total apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the AIOLOS-transfected Jurkat cells (21.93%) compared with this percentage in the Lenti-Mock (13.35%) or the UT group (13.30%; P<0.05). Consistent with these results, AIOLOS overexpression induced P21 and P27 upregulation and CCND3 and SKP2 downregulation. Furthermore, AIOLOS overexpression synergistically increased the cytotoxic effects of etoposide and downregulated NF-kappaB expression. Our findings revealed that lentivirus-mediated AIOLOS overexpression in Jurkat cells induced cell apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and synergistically increased the sensitivity of Jurkat cells to etoposide by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity.","['Zhuang, Yong', 'Lu, Yuanyuan', 'Li, Dong', 'Sun, Nianzheng', 'Ju, Xiuli']","['Zhuang Y', 'Lu Y', 'Li D', 'Sun N', 'Ju X']","['Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

However, gastric cancer cells are less sensitive than other cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we combined TRAIL with kurarinone, a natural compound, to induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901. After the cells were treated with TRAIL and/or kurarinone, the cell viability and apoptosis were examined by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was determined by western blot and q-RT-PCR. Kurarinone at low concentration significantly potentiated the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL by enhancing apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest at G2/Mphase. The enhancement of apoptosis TRAIL induced by kurarinone involved downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and c-FLIP as well as inhibition of STAT3 signaling. Moreover, we found that STAT3 inhibitor could synergistically enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, similar to kurarinone. Kurarinone synergizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells. The synergistic effect between these two drugs is associated with downregulation of Mcl-1 and c-FLIP via inhibiting STAT3 signaling. The combination of TRAIL and kurarinone might be an effective regimen for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.","['Zhou, Wenchao', 'Cao, Aili', 'Wang, Li', 'Wu, Dazheng']","['Zhou W', 'Cao A', 'Wang L', 'Wu D']","['Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China. drdazhengwu@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Gastric cancer', 'Kurarinone', 'STAT3', 'TRAIL']",2014/12/20 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12013-014-0444-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12013-014-0444-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2015 May;72(1):241-9. doi: 10.1007/s12013-014-0444-0.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry', '*Apoptosis', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/*chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*chemistry']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (kurarinone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In multivariate analysis, high risk cytogenetics (P=0.022) and peripheral blasts >10% (P<0.0001) at onset of azacitidine were independently predictive of poor prognosis. Combining these two factors, we identified a subgroup of 48% of patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics and peripheral blasts </=10% and a median OS of 11.3 months.

However, at present, therapeutic strategies for this condition are ineffective. Previous studies have identified that the mutual regulation of chronic inflammation, mechanical force and fibroblast activation leads to the formation of HS. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are novel bioengineered embryoniclike stem cells, initially created from mouse adult fibroblasts. The current study demonstrated that iPSCconditioned medium (iPSCCM) may significantly suppress hypertrophic scar fibroblast activation. It was observed that in the presence of iPSCCM, the level of collagen I was markedly reduced and alphasmooth muscle actin, a marker for myofibroblasts (activated fibroblasts that mediate mechanical forceinduced HS formation), exhibited a significantly lower level of expression in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) activated with transforming growth factorbeta1. Additionally, iPSCCM attenuated the local inflammatory cell response by blocking the adhesion of human acute monocytic leukemia cell monocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. In addition, the contractile ability of HDFs may be reduced by iPSCCM. These observations suggest that iPSCCM may protect against processes leading to hypertrophic scarring by attenuating fibroblast activation, blocking inflammatory cell recruitment and adhesion and reducing the contractile ability of fibroblasts.","['Ren, Ye', 'Deng, Chen-Liang', 'Wan, Wei-Dong', 'Zheng, Jiang-Hong', 'Mao, Guang-Yu', 'Yang, Song-Lin']","['Ren Y', 'Deng CL', 'Wan WD', 'Zheng JH', 'Mao GY', 'Yang SL']","[""Department of Plastic Surgery, Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, P.R.

METHODS: The clinical data of 183 children with newly-diagnosed acute B-ALL and who accepted MRD detection between October 2010 and March 2012 was retrospectively reviewed. According to the detection time and result of MRD, the 183 children were classified into four groups: MRD negative (n=37) and positive (n=18) in the induction chemotherapy and MRD negative (n=113) and positive (n=15) in the maintenance chemotherapy. RESULTS: During both induction and maintenance chemotherapy, the percentage of patients at high and median risk in the MRD positive group was higher than in the MRD positive group (P<0.05). In the maintenance chemotherapy group, the 3- year cumulative incidence of relapse in MRD positive patients was higher than negative patients (P=0.04). The Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis showed that insensitive reaction for prednisone (RR=1.005, 95%CI: 0.864-1.170, P=0.032), bone marrow morphology that did not meet M1 on the 15th day (RR=6.454, 95%CI: 2.191-19.01, P=0.002) and MRD>/=0.01% (RR=1.923, 95%CI: 0.750-4.933, P=0.043) were risk factors for relapse in children with B-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The four-color flow cytometry with the antibody panel can distinguish from MRD positive patients from negative patients with B-ALL. The result of MRD detection, as prednisone sensitivity and bone marrow morphology on the 15th day, is also a independent prognostic factor in children with B-ALL.","['Chang, Li', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Shi, Hua', 'Ye, Lei', 'Jiang, Yong-Mei']","['Chang L', 'Zhang G', 'Shi H', 'Ye L', 'Jiang YM']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China. jiangyongmei-1@163.com.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,,,2014/12/20 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2014.12.012 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2014 Dec;16(12):1245-9.,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of IDH1 expression in AML is still under exploration. To investigate the clinical significance, we analyzed the IDH1/2 expression in 320 patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. High expression of IDH1 was predominant in patients with FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations and less prevalent in cases with CEBPA double allele mutations. Strong association was observed between high IDH1 expression and low expression of microRNA 181 family. Prognosis was adversely affected by high IDH1 expression, with shorter overall survival and event-free survival in the context of clinical characteristics, including age, WBC count, and gene mutations of NPM1, FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2 and DNMT3A in CN-AML. Moreover, the clinical outcome of IDH1 expression in terms of overall survival, event-free survival and complete remission rate still remained in multivariate models in CN-AML. Importantly, the prognostic value was validated using the published microarray data from 79 adult patients treated according to the German AMLCG-1999 protocol.

Terameprocol is a small molecule survivin and Cdc2/CDK1 inhibitor that was studied in a Phase I dose-escalation trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were enrolled and 15 treated with Terameprocol in three dose cohorts intravenously three times per week for 2 weeks every 21 days. RESULTS: Patients had AML (n = 11), chronic myelogeneous leukemia in blast phase (CML-BP, n = 2) and one each T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and MDS. Four, five and six patients were treated at the 1000, 1500 and 2200 mg Terameprocol dose cohorts respectively. Common related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were grade 1 or 2 headache, transaminitis and pruritus, with one grade 4 serious AE (SAE) of pneumonia. No dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed, however, due to other observed grade 3 TEAE the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined at 1500 mg 3x/week for 2 weeks of a 21-day cycle. Partial remission and transfusion independence in a CML-BP patient (1500 mg cohort) and hematological improvement in erythroid (HI-E) and platelet lineage (HI-P) in an AML patient were observed. Five AML patients had stable disease greater/equal to 2 months. Pharmacodynamic studies showed a reduction of CDK1 and phospho-AKT protein expression. CONCLUSION: Terameprocol can be safely administered to advanced leukemia patients, sufficient drug exposure was obtained and clinical activity and biomarker modulation were observed.","['Tibes, R', 'McDonagh, K T', 'Lekakis, L', 'Bogenberger, J M', 'Kim, S', 'Frazer, N', 'Mohrland, S', 'Bassett, D', 'Garcia, R', 'Schroeder, K', 'Shanmugam, V', 'Carpten, J', 'Hagelstrom, R T', 'Beaudry, C', 'Von Hoff, D', 'Shea, T C']","['Tibes R', 'McDonagh KT', 'Lekakis L', 'Bogenberger JM', 'Kim S', 'Frazer N', 'Mohrland S', 'Bassett D', 'Garcia R', 'Schroeder K', 'Shanmugam V', 'Carpten J', 'Hagelstrom RT', 'Beaudry C', 'Von Hoff D', 'Shea TC']","['Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, 13400 E.

In order to identify interaction partners of the ANKHD1 protein and its role in leukemia cells, we performed a yeast two-hybrid system screen and identified SIVA, a cellular protein known to be involved in proapoptotic signaling pathways. The interaction between ANKHD1 and SIVA was confirmed by co-imunoprecipitation assays. Using human leukemia cell models and lentivirus-mediated shRNA approaches, we showed that ANKHD1 and SIVA proteins have opposing effects. While it is known that SIVA silencing promotes Stathmin 1 activation, increased cell migration and xenograft tumor growth, we showed that ANKHD1 silencing leads to Stathmin 1 inactivation, reduced cell migration and xenograft tumor growth, likely through the inhibition of SIVA/Stathmin 1 association. In addition, we observed that ANKHD1 knockdown decreases cell proliferation, without modulating apoptosis of leukemia cells, while SIVA has a proapoptotic function in U937 cells, but does not modulate proliferation in vitro. Results indicate that ANKHD1 binds to SIVA and has an important role in inducing leukemia cell proliferation and migration via the Stathmin 1 pathway. ANKHD1 may be an oncogene and participate in the leukemia cell phenotype.","['Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Lazarini, Mariana', 'Favaro, Patricia', 'de Melo Campos, Paula', 'Scopim-Ribeiro, Renata', 'Franchi Junior, Gilberto Carlos', 'Nowill, Alexandre Eduardo', 'Lima, Paulo Roberto Moura', 'Costa, Fernando Ferreira', 'Benichou, Serge', 'Olalla Saad, Sara Teresinha', 'Traina, Fabiola']","['Machado-Neto JA', 'Lazarini M', 'Favaro P', 'de Melo Campos P', 'Scopim-Ribeiro R', 'Franchi Junior GC', 'Nowill AE', 'Lima PR', 'Costa FF', 'Benichou S', 'Olalla Saad ST', 'Traina F']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Integrated Center for Childhood Onco-Hematological Investigation, University of Campinas, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Integrated Center for Childhood Onco-Hematological Investigation, University of Campinas, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas 13083-878, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Here, we report the findings of a prospective national study designed to investigate the feasibility of immune intervention in children in first or subsequent remission following myeloablative conditioning. This study included 133 children who received a transplant for ALL between 2005 and 2008. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) based on T cell receptor/immunoglobulin gene rearrangements was measured on days -30, 30, 90 and 150 post-transplantation. Ciclosporin treatment was rapidly discontinued and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were programmed for patients with a pre- or post-transplant MRD status >/=10(-3) . Only nine patients received DLI. Pre- and post-transplant MRD status, and the duration of ciclosporin were independently associated with 5-year overall survival (OS), which was 62.07% for the whole cohort. OS was substantially higher in patients cleared of MRD than in those with persistent MRD (52.3% vs. 14.3%, respectively). Only pre-transplant MRD status (Hazard Ratio 2.57, P = 0.04) and duration of ciclosporin treatment (P < 0.001) were independently associated with relapse. The kinetics of chimerism were not useful for predicting relapse, whereas MRD monitoring up to 90 d post-transplantation was a valuable prognostic tool to guide therapeutic intervention.","['Pochon, Cecile', 'Oger, Emmanuel', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Salmon, Alexandra', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Cave, Helene', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Grardel, Nathalie', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Margueritte, Genevieve', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Rohrlich, Pierre', 'Paillard, Catherine', 'Demeocq, Francois', 'Schneider, Pascale', 'Plantaz, Dominique', 'Poiree, Marilyne', 'Eliaou, Jean-Francois', 'Semana, Gilbert', 'Drunat, Severine', 'Jonveaux, Philippe', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Gandemer, Virginie']","['Pochon C', 'Oger E', 'Michel G', 'Dalle JH', 'Salmon A', 'Nelken B', 'Bertrand Y', 'Cave H', 'Cayuela JM', 'Grardel N', 'Macintyre E', 'Margueritte G', 'Mechinaud F', 'Rohrlich P', 'Paillard C', 'Demeocq F', 'Schneider P', 'Plantaz D', 'Poiree M', 'Eliaou JF', 'Semana G', 'Drunat S', 'Jonveaux P', 'Bordigoni P', 'Gandemer V']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology/oncology, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141219,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood leukaemia', 'chimerism', 'immunotherapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'stem cell transplantation']",2014/12/20 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/12/20 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13272 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Apr;169(2):249-61. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13272.

Western blot analysis was used to test the expression levels of cell apoptosis-related proteins Caspase-3, Caspase-9, PARP, P-STAT-3 (Tyr705) , STAT-3, Bcl-2, Mcl-1. RESULT: ESB could notably inhibit proliferation of HepG2 cells, and induce HepG2 cell apoptosis, with the dose-dependent inhibitory effect. In addition, ESB could inhibit STAT-3 signaling, down-regulate Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expressions, and induce degradation/activation of apoptosis-related proteins Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 and PARP degradation in a dose-dependent manner.

In addition to its expression in cancerous cells, the NS gene is expressed in stem cells including embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Previous knockdown and knockout studies have demonstrated that NS is important to preserve the self-renewality and high expression levels of pluripotency marker genes in ESCs. Here, we found that forced expression of Nanog or Esrrb, but not other pluripotency factors, resulted in the dispensability of NS expression in ESCs. However, the detrimental phenotypes of ESCs associated with ablation of NS expression were not mitigated by forced expression of Rad51 or a nucleolar localization-defective NS mutant that counteracts the damage associated with loss of NS expression in other NS-expressing cells such as neural stem/progenitor cells. Thus, our results indicate that NS participates in preservation of the viability and integrity of ESCs, which is distinct from that in other NS-expressing cells.","['Katano, Miyuki', 'Ema, Masatsugu', 'Nakachi, Yutaka', 'Mizuno, Yosuke', 'Hirasaki, Masataka', 'Suzuki, Ayumu', 'Ueda, Atsushi', 'Nishimoto, Masazumi', 'Takahashi, Satoru', 'Okazaki, Yasushi', 'Okuda, Akihiko']","['Katano M', 'Ema M', 'Nakachi Y', 'Mizuno Y', 'Hirasaki M', 'Suzuki A', 'Ueda A', 'Nishimoto M', 'Takahashi S', 'Okazaki Y', 'Okuda A']","['Division of Developmental Biology, Saitama Medical University, Yamane, Hidaka, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,PMC4409032,['NOTNLM'],"['Embryonic stem cells', 'Epiblast stem cells', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'Pluripotency']",2014/12/19 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1918 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Apr;33(4):1089-101. doi: 10.1002/stem.1918.,"['(c) 2014 The Authors.

HTLV-1 Tax has been shown to have a prosurvival role in infected T cells by enhancing expression of the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins. In this study, we show that the expression of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) and Bid (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) is diminished in HTLV-1-infected leukemic cells. Using a Tax-inducible system and a transient overexpression approach, we demonstrate that Tax downregulates Bid and Bim expression at the transcriptional level. We show that reinforced expression of Bim and Bid in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines sensitizes CD95/TRAIL- and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Tax suppresses Bid and Bim expression by enhancing hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein expression. siRNA knockdown of HIF-1alpha or chemical inhibition of the transactivation activity of HIF-1alpha resulted in an increase in Bid and Bim expression and, consequently, in an increase in CD95/TRAIL- and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected leukemic T-cell lines. Our study provides evidence that besides upregulation of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, Tax may also confer apoptosis resistance to HTLV-1-infected T cells by suppressing the expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Bid.","['Muhleisen, A', 'Giaisi, M', 'Kohler, R', 'Krammer, P H', 'Li-Weber, M']","['Muhleisen A', 'Giaisi M', 'Kohler R', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumor Immunology Program D030, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program D030, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program D030, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program D030, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program D030, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg 69120, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141218,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC4649845,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014536 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.536 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Dec 18;5:e1575. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.536.,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology/virology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we exploit T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model to define the critical initiating events in this disease. First, thymocytes that are reprogrammed by the SCL and LMO1 oncogenic transcription factors into self-renewing pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) remain non-malignant, as evidenced by their capacities to generate functional T cells. Second, we provide strong genetic evidence that SCL directly interacts with LMO1 to activate the transcription of a self-renewal program coordinated by LYL1. Moreover, LYL1 can substitute for SCL to reprogram thymocytes in concert with LMO1. In contrast, inhibition of E2A was not sufficient to substitute for SCL, indicating that thymocyte reprogramming requires transcription activation by SCL-LMO1. Third, only a specific subset of normal thymic cells, known as DN3 thymocytes, is susceptible to reprogramming. This is because physiological NOTCH1 signals are highest in DN3 cells compared to other thymocyte subsets. Consistent with this, overexpression of a ligand-independent hyperactive NOTCH1 allele in all immature thymocytes is sufficient to sensitize them to SCL-LMO1, thereby increasing the pool of self-renewing cells. Surprisingly, hyperactive NOTCH1 cannot reprogram thymocytes on its own, despite the fact that NOTCH1 is activated by gain of function mutations in more than 55% of T-ALL cases. Rather, elevating NOTCH1 triggers a parallel pathway involving Hes1 and Myc that dramatically enhances the activity of SCL-LMO1 We conclude that the acquisition of self-renewal and the genesis of pre-LSCs from thymocytes with a finite lifespan represent a critical first event in T-ALL. Finally, LYL1 and LMO1 or LMO2 are co-expressed in most human T-ALL samples, except the cortical T subtype. We therefore anticipate that the self-renewal network described here may be relevant to a majority of human T-ALL.","['Gerby, Bastien', 'Tremblay, Cedric S', 'Tremblay, Mathieu', 'Rojas-Sutterlin, Shanti', 'Herblot, Sabine', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Lecuyer, Eric', 'Veiga, Diogo F T', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Gerby B', 'Tremblay CS', 'Tremblay M', 'Rojas-Sutterlin S', 'Herblot S', 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G', 'Lemieux S', 'Lecuyer E', 'Veiga DF', 'Hoang T']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer - University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Molecular Biology Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer - University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Molecular Biology Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer - University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Molecular Biology Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer - University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Molecular Biology Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer - University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer - University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Molecular Biology Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital.

Although numerous chemotypes have been reported to inhibit HIV RNase H biochemically, few show significant antiviral activity against HIV. We report herein the design, synthesis, and biological evaluations of a novel variant of 2-hydroxyisoquinoline-1,3-dione (HID) scaffold featuring a crucial C-6 benzyl or biarylmethyl moiety. The synthesis involved a recently reported metal-free direct benzylation between tosylhydrazone and boronic acid, which allowed the generation of structural diversity for the hydrophobic aromatic region. Biochemical studies showed that the C-6 benzyl and biarylmethyl HID analogues, previously unknown chemotypes, consistently inhibited HIV RT-associated RNase H and polymerase with IC50s in low to submicromolar range. The observed dual inhibitory activity remained uncompromised against RT mutants resistant to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), suggesting the involvement of binding site(s) other than the NNRTI binding pocket. Intriguingly, these same compounds inhibited the polymerase, but not the RNase H function of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMLV) RT and also inhibited Escherichia coli RNase H. Additional biochemical testing revealed a substantially reduced level of inhibition against HIV integrase. Molecular docking corroborates favorable binding of these analogues to the active site of HIV RNase H. Finally, a number of these analogues also demonstrated antiviral activity at low micromolar concentrations.","['Vernekar, Sanjeev Kumar V', 'Liu, Zheng', 'Nagy, Eva', 'Miller, Lena', 'Kirby, Karen A', 'Wilson, Daniel J', 'Kankanala, Jayakanth', 'Sarafianos, Stefan G', 'Parniak, Michael A', 'Wang, Zhengqiang']","['Vernekar SK', 'Liu Z', 'Nagy E', 'Miller L', 'Kirby KA', 'Wilson DJ', 'Kankanala J', 'Sarafianos SG', 'Parniak MA', 'Wang Z']","['Center for Drug Design, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota , 516 Delaware Street SE, PWB 7-224, MMC 204 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141230,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,PMC4306517,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/04/01 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm501132s [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2015 Jan 22;58(2):651-64. doi: 10.1021/jm501132s.

However, the low cellular content of most UCB units represents a limitation to this approach. An option to increase cell dose is to harvest bone marrow (BM) cells from the same donor and infuse them along with the UCB. We studied 156 children who received such a combined graft between 1992 and 2011. Median age was 7 years and 78% of patients (n = 122) were transplanted for non-malignant diseases, mainly haemoglobinopathies. Acute leukaemia (n = 26) was the most frequent malignant diagnosis. Most patients (91%) received myeloablative conditioning. Median donor age was 1.7 years, median infused nucleated cell dose was 24.4 x 10(7) /kg and median follow-up was 41 months. Sixty-days neutrophil recovery occurred in 96% of patients at a median of 17 d. The probabilities of grade-II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 19% and 10%, respectively. Four-year overall survival was 90% (68% malignant; 97% non-malignant diseases) with 3% probability of death. In conclusion, combined UCB and BM transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor is an effective treatment for children with malignant and non-malignant disorders with high overall survival and low incidence of GVHD.","['Tucunduva, Luciana', 'Volt, Fernanda', 'Cunha, Renato', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Yesilipek, Akif', 'Caniglia, Maurizio', 'Gungor, Tayfun', 'Aksoylar, Serap', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Addari, Maria Carmen', 'de la Fuente, Josu', 'Winiarski, Jacek', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Sengeloev, Henrik', 'Badell, Isabel', 'Mellgren, Karin', 'de Heredia, Cristina Diaz', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Gluckman, Eliane']","['Tucunduva L', 'Volt F', 'Cunha R', 'Locatelli F', 'Zecca M', 'Yesilipek A', 'Caniglia M', 'Gungor T', 'Aksoylar S', 'Fagioli F', 'Bertrand Y', 'Addari MC', 'de la Fuente J', 'Winiarski J', 'Biondi A', 'Sengeloev H', 'Badell I', 'Mellgren K', 'de Heredia CD', 'Sedlacek P', 'Vora A', 'Rocha V', 'Ruggeri A', 'Gluckman E']","['Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Eurocord, Paris, France; Centro de Oncologia, Hospital Sirio-Libanes, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20141218,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow', 'cord blood', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2014/12/19 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13267 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Apr;169(1):103-10. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13267.

However, there is no report on the antiallergic effects of the components in C. tinctorius. In the present study, we investigated the antiallergic components of C. tinctorius and its mechanism of action. A rat basophilic leukemia 2H3/cell membrane chromatography coupled online with high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to screen antiallergic components from C. tinctorius. The screening results showed that Hydroxysafflor yellow A, from C. tinctorius, was the targeted component that retained on the rat basophilic leukemia 2H3/cell membrane chromatography column. We measured the amount of beta-hexosaminidase and histamine released in mast cells and the key markers of degranulation. The release assays showed that Hydroxysafflor yellow A could attenuate the immunoglobulin E induced release of allergic cytokines without affecting cell viability from 1.0 to 50.0 muM. In conclusion, the established rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cell membrane chromatography coupled with online high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry method successfully screened and identified Hydroxysafflor yellow A from C. tinctorius as a potential antiallergic component.

Here, we demonstrate that the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein modulates phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of the FOXO3a transcription factor, via upstream activation of the AKT pathway. De novo HTLV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells or direct lentiviral-mediated introduction of Tax led to AKT activation and AKT-dependent inactivation of FOXO3a, via phosphorylation of residues Ser253 and Thr32. Inhibition of FOXO3a signalling led to the long-term survival of a population of highly activated, terminally differentiated CD4+Tax+CD27negCCR7neg T cells that maintained the capacity to disseminate infectious HTLV-1. CD4+ T cell persistence was reversed by chemical inhibition of AKT activity, lentiviral-mediated expression of a dominant-negative form of FOXO3a or by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of FOXO3a. Overall this study provides new mechanistic insight into the strategies used by HTLV-1 to increase long-term maintenance of Tax+CD4+ T lymphocytes during the early stages of HTLV-1 pathogenesis.","['Olagnier, David', 'Sze, Alexandre', 'Bel Hadj, Samar', 'Chiang, Cindy', 'Steel, Courtney', 'Han, Xiaoying', 'Routy, Jean-Pierre', 'Lin, Rongtuan', 'Hiscott, John', 'van Grevenynghe, Julien']","['Olagnier D', 'Sze A', 'Bel Hadj S', 'Chiang C', 'Steel C', 'Han X', 'Routy JP', 'Lin R', 'Hiscott J', 'van Grevenynghe J']","['Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; VGTI Florida, Port St. Lucie, Florida, United States of America.', 'Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'VGTI Florida, Port St. Lucie, Florida, United States of America.', 'VGTI Florida, Port St. Lucie, Florida, United States of America.', 'Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Immunodeficiency Service and Division of Haematology, Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University Health Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; VGTI Florida, Port St. Lucie, Florida, United States of America.', 'Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; VGTI Florida, Port St. Lucie, Florida, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141218,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,PMC4270795,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004575 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-01890 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 Dec 18;10(12):e1004575. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004575. eCollection 2014 Dec.,,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/*virology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Viral Proteins/physiology']","['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,['MOP-106686/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the 11 cases with available information at the time of diagnosis, CMV disease occurred during maintenance therapy in 10 patients. Fever was present in 9 cases. CMV disease manifested as retinitis in 6, hepatosplenic disease in 3, pneumonitis in 1, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in 1 patient. One patient had both CMV retinitis and CMV-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Four of the 7 patients with retinitis complained of visual disturbance at diagnosis.

These features make gammadelta T cells promising effector cells for antibody-based immunotherapy in pediatric patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To evaluate combination of human gammadelta T cells with CD19 antibodies for immunotherapy of B-lineage ALL, gammadelta T cells were expanded after a GMP-compliant protocol and ADCC of both primary and expanded gammadelta T cells with an Fc-optimized CD19 antibody (4G7SDIE) and a bi-specific antibody with the specificities CD19 and CD16 (N19-C16) was evaluated in CD107a-degranulation assays and intracellular cytokine staining. CD107a, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma expression of primary gammadelta T cells were significantly increased and correlated with CD16-expression of gammadelta T cells. gammadelta T cells highly expressed CD107a after expansion and no further increased expression by 4G7SDIE and N19-C16 was measured. Cytotoxicity of purified expanded gammadelta T cells targeting CD19-expressing cells was assessed in both europium-TDA release and in an impedance-based label-free method (using the xCELLigence system) measuring gammadelta T cell lysis in real-time. Albeit in the 2 h end-point europium-TDA release assay no increased lysis was observed, in real-time xCELLigence assays both significant antibody-independent cytotoxicity and ADCC of gammadelta T cells were observed. The xCELLigence system outperformed the end-point europium-TDA release assay in sensitivity and allows drawing of conclusions to lysis kinetics of gammadelta T cells over prolonged periods of time periods. Combination of CD19 antibodies with primary as well as expanded gammadelta T cells exhibits a promising approach, which may enhance clinical outcome of patients with pediatric B-lineage ALL and requires clinical evaluation.","['Seidel, Ursula Jordis Eva', 'Vogt, Fabian', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Jung, Gundram', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Lang, Peter']","['Seidel UJ', 'Vogt F', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Jung G', 'Handgretinger R', 'Lang P']","[""Department of General Paediatrics, Oncology/Haematology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen , Tubingen , Germany."", 'Department of Immunology, Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen , Tubingen , Germany ; Partner Site Tubingen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Tubingen , Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen , Tubingen , Germany ; SYNIMMUNE GmbH , Tubingen , Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen , Tubingen , Germany ; Partner Site Tubingen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Tubingen , Germany.', ""Department of General Paediatrics, Oncology/Haematology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen , Tubingen , Germany ; Partner Site Tubingen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Tubingen , Germany."", ""Department of General Paediatrics, Oncology/Haematology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen , Tubingen , Germany ; Partner Site Tubingen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Tubingen , Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141202,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC4251440,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'therapeutic antibodies', 'tumor immunotherapy', 'xCELLigence system', 'gammadelta T cell expansion']",2014/12/19 06:00,2014/12/19 06:01,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2014.00618 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2014 Dec 2;5:618. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00618. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second- and later-generation CARs simultaneously transmit costimulatory signals with CD3zeta signals upon ligation, but may lead to severe adverse effects owing to the recognition of minimal Ag expression outside the target tumor. Currently, the threshold target Ag density for CAR-T cell lysis and further activation, including cytokine production, has not yet been investigated in detail. Therefore, we determined the threshold target Ag density required to induce CAR-T cell responses using novel anti-CD20 CAR-T cells with a CD28 intracellular domain and a CD20-transduced CEM cell model. The newly developed CD20CAR-T cells demonstrated Ag-specific lysis and cytokine secretion, which was a reasonable level as a second-generation CAR. For lytic activity, the threshold Ag density was determined to be approximately 200 molecules per target cell, whereas the Ag density required for cytokine production of CAR-T cells was approximately 10-fold higher, at a few thousand per target cell. CD20CAR-T cells responded efficiently to CD20-downregulated lymphoma and leukemia targets, including rituximab- or ofatumumab-refractory primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Despite the potential influence of the structure, localization, and binding affinity of the CAR/Ag, the threshold determined may be used for target Ag selection. An Ag density below the threshold may not result in adverse effects, whereas that above the threshold may be sufficient for practical effectiveness. CD20CAR-T cells also demonstrated significant lytic activity against CD20-downregulated tumor cells and may exhibit effectiveness for CD20-positive lymphoid malignancies.","['Watanabe, Keisuke', 'Terakura, Seitaro', 'Martens, Anton C', 'van Meerten, Tom', 'Uchiyama, Susumu', 'Imai, Misa', 'Sakemura, Reona', 'Goto, Tatsunori', 'Hanajiri, Ryo', 'Imahashi, Nobuhiko', 'Shimada, Kazuyuki', 'Tomita, Akihiro', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Nishida, Tetsuya', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Murata, Makoto']","['Watanabe K', 'Terakura S', 'Martens AC', 'van Meerten T', 'Uchiyama S', 'Imai M', 'Sakemura R', 'Goto T', 'Hanajiri R', 'Imahashi N', 'Shimada K', 'Tomita A', 'Kiyoi H', 'Nishida T', 'Naoe T', 'Murata M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan; tseit@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, 1007 MB Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3508 GA Utrecht, the Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, 9700 RB Groningen, the Netherlands;', 'Division of Advanced Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan;', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya 468-8503, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan; Institute for Advanced Research, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan; National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya 460-0001, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141217,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402346 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402346 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Feb 1;194(3):911-20. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402346.

However, the relationship between BCR-ABL subtypes and progression of CML and ALL remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 354 CML chronic phase (CML-CP) patients, 26 CML blastic phase (CML-BP) patients and 72 ALL patients before treatment with BCR-ABL positive were recruited for blood routine examination and bone marrow smear cytology. Some 80 CML-CP and 32 ALL patients after imatinib (IM) treatment were followed-up for BCR-ABL relative concentrations detected after treatment for 3, 6 and 9 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Before treatment, CML-CP patients showed lower BCR-ABL relative concentrations with a higher proportion of M-bcr (42.7%) compared to CML-BP and ALL patients while ALL patients had a higher BCR-ABL relative concentration with high expression of m-bcr (51.4%). Patients with M-bcr demonstrated higher WBC counts than those with m-bcr and the mixed group and higher PLT counts were noted in the CML-CP and ALL groups. After imatinib (IM) treatment, patients with m-bcr showed higher BCR-ABL relative concentrations in both CML-CP and ALL groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the BCR-ABL gene as an important factor in CML and ALL cases. The M-bcr subtype was associated more with CML while the m-bcr subtype was associated more with ALL. Patients with m-bcr seem to have a poorer response to IM in either CML or ALL patients compared to M-bcr patients.","['Ye, Yuan-Xin', 'Zhou, Juan', 'Zhou, Yan-Hong', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Song, Xing-Bo', 'Wang, Jun', 'Lin, Li', 'Ying, Bin-Wu', 'Lu, Xiao-Jun']","['Ye YX', 'Zhou J', 'Zhou YH', 'Zhou Y', 'Song XB', 'Wang J', 'Lin L', 'Ying BW', 'Lu XJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China E-mail : docbwy@126.com; luxiaojun1972@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/08/14 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.22.9961 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(22):9961-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.22.9961.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed suppressed cell proliferation and induction of G0/G1-phase arrest,while expression of CDK1, and activity of smad3 and smad5 were reduced, but that of p27, p53 and STGC3 was increased. LamD induced cell apoptosis through activation of caspases-8/-3, inhibition of survivin and Bcl-2, suggesting that this compound may also act through a caspase-independent pathway.

Taken together, our results suggest that LamD-mediated inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation may be related to the induction of apoptosis and the regulation of cell cycle, tumor- related gene expression and cytokine expression, which may provide a new way of thinking for the treatment leukemia.","['Zhang, Nan', 'Wang, Dong', 'Zhu, Yu', 'Wang, Jian', 'Lin, Hong']","['Zhang N', 'Wang D', 'Zhu Y', 'Wang J', 'Lin H']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Tianjin Children's Hospital, Tianjin, China E-mail : roylinvip1969@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/08/14 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.22.9915 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(22):9915-9. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.22.9915.,,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (lamellarin D)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 24 hours of co-culture, apoptosis of CLL cells was assessed by annexin V staining. RESULTS: The amount of Apoptosis was examined separately in four groups: 293 HEK TRAIL (16.17+/-1.04%); 293 HEK GFP (2.7+/-0.57%); WT 293 HEK (2+/-2.6%); and CLL cells (0.01+/-0.01%). Among the groups studied, the maximum amount of apoptosis was in the group that the vector encoding TRAIL was transducted. In this group, the mean level of soluble TRAIL in the culture medium was 253 pg/ml; also flow cytometry analyzes showed that proapotosis in this group was 32.8+/-1.6%, which was higher than the other groups.

This observation provides strong rationale for use of JAK inhibitors for MPN treatment, and these drugs were first tested in myelofibrosis (MF) patients. Ruxolitinib, a JAK-1/2 inhibitor, is effective at controlling splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, but has limited benefit in reversing bone marrow fibrosis or inducing complete or partial remissions. Ruxolitinib is currently in Phase 3 testing for treatment of hydroxyurea resistant/intolerant polycythemia vera (PV). Preliminary data reveals response rates of 60% for hematocrit control and 38% for spleen volume reduction per protocol-defined criteria, in addition to improving disease-related symptoms. These endpoints however have limited value as surrogates for long-term clinically relevant outcomes such as freedom-from-cardiovascular/thrombohemorrhagic events or time-to-hematological transformation, and the early crossover design of the aforementioned trial introduces limitations in terms of analysis of these latter endpoints. In contrast, other recent trials in PV have demonstrated the feasibility of using long-term clinically relevant outcomes as a primary endpoint.

In humans, OS has been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, as well as atherosclerosis, autism, cancer, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

Here, we first demonstrate the capacity of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to differentiate into CD144(+)CD73(-)CD43/CD235a(-) cells, characterized as hemogenic endothelium, and show that this population is capable of differentiating to CD10(+)CD19(+) B lymphocytes. We also demonstrate that B lymphocytes generated from hiPSCs are able to undergo full VDJ rearrangement and express surface IgM (sIgM(+)), thus representing an immature B-cell subset. Efficiency of sIgM expression on the hiPSC-derived B lymphocytes ( approximately 5% of CD19(+) cells) was comparable with B lymphocytes generated from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic progenitor cells. Importantly, when assessed by global transcriptional profiling, hiPSC-derived B-cells show a very high level of similarity when compared with their UCB-derived counterparts, such that from more than 47,000 different transcripts, only 45 were significantly different (with a criteria adjusted P value P<0.05, log FC >1.5 or 2.8-fold).

We hypothesized that besides these quantitative transcriptional effects, HTLV-1 qualitatively modifies the pattern of cellular gene expression. RESULTS: Exon expression analysis shows that patients' untransformed and malignant HTLV-1(+) CD4(+) T-cells exhibit multiple alternate exon usage (AEU) events. These affect either transcriptionally modified or unmodified genes, culminate in ATLL, and unveil new functional pathways involved in cancer and cell cycle. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of array data permitted to isolate exon expression patterns of 3977 exons that discriminate uninfected, infected, and transformed CD4(+) T-cells. Furthermore, untransformed infected CD4+ clones and ATLL samples shared 486 exon modifications distributed in 320 genes, thereby indicating a role of AEUs in HTLV-1 leukemogenesis. Exposing cells to splicing modulators revealed that Sudemycin E reduces cell viability of HTLV-1 transformed cells without affecting primary control CD4+ cells and HTLV-1 negative cell lines, suggesting that the huge excess of AEU might provide news targets for treating ATLL. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data reveal that HTLV-1 significantly modifies the structure of cellular transcripts and unmask new putative leukemogenic pathways and possible therapeutic targets.","['Thenoz, Morgan', 'Vernin, Celine', 'Mortada, Hussein', 'Karam, Maroun', 'Pinatel, Christiane', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Webb, Thomas R', 'Auboeuf, Didier', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Mortreux, Franck']","['Thenoz M', 'Vernin C', 'Mortada H', 'Karam M', 'Pinatel C', 'Gessain A', 'Webb TR', 'Auboeuf D', 'Wattel E', 'Mortreux F']","['Universite de Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5239, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France. morgan.thenoz@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Universite de Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5239, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France. celine.vernin@gmail.com.', 'Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lyon, France Epissage alternatif et progression tumorale, Lyon, France. hussein.mortada@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5239, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France. maroun-karam@hotmail.fr.', 'Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lyon, France Epissage alternatif et progression tumorale, Lyon, France. christiane.pinatel@lyon.unicancer.fr.', ""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Paris, France. agessain@pasteur.fr."", 'SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA, 94025-3493, USA. thomas.webb@sri.com.', 'Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lyon, France Epissage alternatif et progression tumorale, Lyon, France.

Here, we analyzed 7898 Japanese pairs transplanted with T-cell-replete marrow from an unrelated donor with complete HLA allele typing data. Multivariable competing risk regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the relative risk (RR) of clinical outcomes after transplantation. A significant RR of HLA allele mismatch compared with match was seen with HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DPB1 for grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and HLA-C for chronic GVHD. Of note, only HLA-C and HLA-DPB1 mismatch reduced leukemia relapse, and this graft-versus-leukemia effect of HLA-DPB1 was independent of chronic GVHD. HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 double (DRB1_DQB1) mismatch was revealed to be a significant RR for acute GVHD and mortality, whereas single mismatch was not. Thus, the number of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, and DRB1_DQB1 mismatches showed a clear-cut risk difference for acute GVHD, whereas the number of mismatches for HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1_DQB1 showed the same for mortality. In conclusion, we determined the biological response to HLA locus mismatch in transplant-related immunologic events, and provide a rationale for use of a personalized algorithm for unrelated donor selection.","['Morishima, Yasuo', 'Kashiwase, Koichi', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Azuma, Fumihiro', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Yabe, Toshio', 'Murata, Makoto', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Sao, Hiroshi', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Saji, Hiroo', 'Kato, Shunichi', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kawa, Keisei', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Sasazuki, Takehiko']","['Morishima Y', 'Kashiwase K', 'Matsuo K', 'Azuma F', 'Morishima S', 'Onizuka M', 'Yabe T', 'Murata M', 'Doki N', 'Eto T', 'Mori T', 'Miyamura K', 'Sao H', 'Ichinohe T', 'Saji H', 'Kato S', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kawa K', 'Kodera Y', 'Sasazuki T']","['Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan;', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Kyushu University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan;', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan;', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan;', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan;', 'Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology, Meitetsu Hospital, Nagoya, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan;', 'HLA Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Cell Transplantation, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan;', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan;', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Osaka, Japan;', 'Department of Promotion for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan; and.', 'Institute for Advanced Study, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141217,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4326776,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35280-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-604785 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 12;125(7):1189-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-604785.

All started treatment with imatinib 600 mg/day. Imatinib plasma trough level was performed at day 22 and if <1000 ng/mL, imatinib 800 mg/day was given. Patients were then assessed against molecular targets: BCR-ABL1 </=10%, </=1%, and </=0.1% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Cohort 1 patients failing any target escalated to imatinib 800 mg/day, and subsequently switched to nilotinib 400 mg twice daily for failing the same target 3 months later. Cohort 2 patients failing any target switched to nilotinib directly, as did patients with intolerance or loss of response in either cohort. At 2 years, 55% of patients remained on imatinib, and 30% on nilotinib. Only 12% were >10% BCR-ABL1 at 3 months. Confirmed major molecular response was achieved in 64% at 12 months and 73% at 24 months. MR4.5 (BCR-ABL1 </=0.0032%) at 24 months was 34%.

Multiple prognostic factors have been used in order to assist the clinician to decide appropriate risk-adjusted treatment for each patient; the current clinical outcomes of those patients have been significantly improved over the past decades. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine survival outcome in children who were diagnosed with acute leukemia and treated in the Department of Pediatrics, Phramongkutklao Hospital during January 1, 2000 and July 31, 2013. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors retrospectively reviewed the patients who were diagnosed with acute leukemia and treated at Phramongkutklao Hospital. Their clinical data were collected and analyzed based on clinicalfeatures inchluding age, initial WBC count at diagnosis, sex, immnunophenotype and cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: Total 152 patients with acute leukemia, 123 patients were diagnosed with acute lymnphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 29 patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The 5-year survival rates of ALL and AML patients were 72.63% and 30.30%, respectively. In addition, we found a correlation between the ALL patients' clinical outcomes and several prognostic factors including initial white blood cell count, CNS status at diagnosis and ploidy. However, there was no correlation between those factors and clinical outcomes in AML patients. CONCLUSION: Our treatment outcomes on patients with acute leukemia were similar to the reports from other countries. The several prognostic factors especially initial WBC at diagnosis can assist the clinician to select appropriate treatment option for each patient.","['Rujkijyanont, Piya', 'Kaewinsang, Suphathida', 'Monsereenusorn, Chalinee', 'Traivaree, Chanchai']","['Rujkijyanont P', 'Kaewinsang S', 'Monsereenusorn C', 'Traivaree C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,,,2014/12/19 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/12/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2014 Feb;97 Suppl 2:S188-95.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of very different clinical implications, accurate diagnosis is critical. The NOTCH1 signaling pathway is frequently activated in T-LBL and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Antibodies to NOTCH1 intracellular domain (N1ICD), recognizing the active form of NOTCH1, have been developed. We hypothesized that detection of N1ICD would be useful in distinguishing T-LBL from thymoma and investigated a series of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for immunoreactivity with an N1ICD antibody using automated immunohistochemistry. Slides were scored using a 25% nuclear reactivity threshold for positivity. Hyperplastic tonsil showed positivity in few scattered interfollicular lymphoid cells, suprabasilar epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. Thymocytes from non-neoplastic thymus were largely negative for N1ICD. All thymomas tested (n=23) were negative for N1ICD, although epithelial cells and a small minority of thymocytes may be positive, requiring careful interpretation. All T-LBL cases (n=16) were scored positive for N1ICD: 8 (50%) of these showed diffuse and mostly strong immunoreactivity, whereas the remaining 8 (50%) had less extensive positivity, but with consistently >25% nuclear staining. In conclusion, normal thymocytes do not express significant levels of N1ICD. In keeping with this pattern, thymomas are negative for N1ICD, whereas a high percentage of T-LBL expresses N1ICD. Thus, N1ICD immunohistochemistry appears to be a useful method in distinguishing T-LBL from thymoma.","['Jegalian, Armin G', 'Bodo, Juraj', 'Hsi, Eric D']","['Jegalian AG', 'Bodo J', 'Hsi ED']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,,,2014/12/18 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0000000000000358 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2015 Apr;39(4):565-72. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000358.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Automation, Laboratory', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, Notch1/*analysis', 'Thymoma/*chemistry/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Young Adult']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be seen in patients who are chronically infected before transplant or from passage of virus from an infected donor; the normal 10-year course of hepatitis C after transplant is one of waxing and waning of serum aminotransferase enzymes, with little morbidity. In the series of 3 patients reported here, the course of hepatitis C was rapidly fatal, with the onset of jaundice at day 60 to 80 after transplant and liver histology typical of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (marked bile ductular proliferation, ballooned hepatocytes, and associated collagenous fibrosis centered around ductules). The bile ductular reaction pattern varied from elongated structures without a recognizable lumen to a pattern of cuboidal cells with a clear lumen. There was significant cholestasis with bile within hepatocytes and canalicular bile plugs.

All 3 patients were on immunosuppressive drugs after transplant, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), which irreversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, on which T and B lymphocytes are dependent.

We evaluated survival after calculating the actual dose of cytarabine that patients received for consolidation therapy and divided them into 3 groups according to dose. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study involving 311 non-promyelocytic AML patients with a median age of 36 years (16-79 years) who received curative treatment between 1978 and 2007. The 131 patients who received cytarabine consolidation were assigned to study groups by their cytarabine dose protocol. Group 1 (n=69) received <1.5 g/m2 every 12 h on 3 alternate days for up to 4 cycles. The remaining patients received high-dose cytarabine (>/=1.5 g/m2 every 12 h on 3 alternate days for up to 4 cycles). The actual dose received during the entire consolidation period in these patients was calculated, allowing us to divide these patients into 2 additional groups. Group 2 (n=27) received an intermediate-high-dose (<27 g/m2), and group 3 (n=35) received a very-high-dose (>/=27 g/m2). Among the 311 patients receiving curative treatment, the 5-year survival rate was 20.2% (63 patients). The cytarabine consolidation dose was an independent determinant of survival in multivariate analysis; age, karyotype, induction protocol, French-American-British classification, and de novo leukemia were not. Comparisons showed that the risk of death was higher in the intermediate-high-dose group 2 (hazard ratio [HR]=4.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.81-11.21) and the low-dose group 1 (HR=4.43; 95% CI: 1.97-9.96) than in the very-high-dose group 3, with no significant difference between those two groups. Our findings indicated that very-high-dose cytarabine during consolidation in adults with non-promyelocytic AML may improve survival.","['Azevedo, M C', 'Velloso, E D R P', 'Buccheri, V', 'Chamone, D A F', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer, P E']","['Azevedo MC', 'Velloso ED', 'Buccheri V', 'Chamone DA', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer PE']","['Servico de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141212,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,PMC4321225,,,2014/12/18 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2014005044059 [pii]', '10.1590/1414-431X20144059 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2015 Feb;48(2):178-85. doi: 10.1590/1414-431X20144059.

Recent advances in single-cell gene expression profiling have created new possibilities to characterize this heterogeneity and to dissect the potential intra-cancer cellular hierarchy. RESULTS: Here, we apply single-cell analysis to systematically characterize the heterogeneity within leukemic cells using the MLL-AF9 driven mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia. We start with fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with seven surface markers, and extend by using a multiplexing quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach to assay the transcriptional profile of a panel of 175 carefully selected genes in leukemic cells at the single-cell level. By employing a set of computational tools we find striking heterogeneity within leukemic cells. Mapping to the normal hematopoietic cellular hierarchy identifies two distinct subtypes of leukemic cells; one similar to granulocyte/monocyte progenitors and the other to macrophage and dendritic cells. Further functional experiments suggest that these subtypes differ in proliferation rates and clonal phenotypes. Finally, co-expression network analysis reveals similarities as well as organizational differences between leukemia and normal granulocyte/monocyte progenitor networks. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our single-cell analysis pinpoints previously uncharacterized heterogeneity within leukemic cells and provides new insights into the molecular signatures of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Saadatpour, Assieh', 'Guo, Guoji', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Yuan, Guo-Cheng']","['Saadatpour A', 'Guo G', 'Orkin SH', 'Yuan GC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141203,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,PMC4262970,,,2014/12/18 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['s13059-014-0525-9 [pii]', '10.1186/s13059-014-0525-9 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2014 Dec 3;15(12):525. doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0525-9.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monocyte-Macrophage Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",,,,"['P30 DK049216/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG005085/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK049216/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HG005085/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Curcumin anti-tumor effects were previously characterized in multiple myeloma, however only few MM cell lines were included in these studies. Since myeloma is a heterogeneous disease it is important to address the impact of myeloma molecular heterogeneity in curcumin cell death induction. In the present study, a large panel of human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) (n = 29), representing the main molecular MM subgroups, was screened for curcumin sensitivity. We observed that curcumin cell death induction was heterogeneous, of note 16 HMCLs were highly sensitive to curcumin (LD50 < 20.5 muM), 6 HMCLs exhibited intermediate LD50 values (20.5 muM </= LD50 < 32.2 muM) and only 7 HMCLs were weakly sensitive (35 < LD50 < 56 muM). Cell lines harboring the t(11;14) translocation were less sensitive (median LD50 32.9 muM) than non-t(11;14) (median LD50 17.9 muM), which included poor prognosis t(4;14) and t(14;16) cells. Interestingly, curcumin sensitivity was not dependent on TP53 status. For the first time we showed that primary myeloma cells were also sensitive, even those displaying del(17p), another poor prognosis factor. We also unravel the contribution of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family molecules in curcumin response. We found that down-regulation of Mcl-1, an essential MM survival factor, was associated with curcumin-induced cell death and its knockdown sensitized myeloma cells to curcumin, highlighting Mcl-1 as an important target for curcumin-induced apoptosis. Altogether, these results support clinical trials including curcumin in association with standard therapy.","['Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Halliez, Maxime', 'Maiga, Sophie', 'Godon, Catherine', 'Kervoelen, Charlotte', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, Catherine', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Gomez-Bougie P', 'Halliez M', 'Maiga S', 'Godon C', 'Kervoelen C', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Moreau P', 'Amiot M']","['a INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS; UMR 6299; Universite de Nantes ; Nantes , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC4622499,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2 molecules', 'CCND, Cyclin D', 'HMCLs, human myeloma cell line(s)', 'MM, multiple myeloma', 'Mcl-1', 'Myeloma', 'apoptosis', 'curcumin']",2014/12/18 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384047.2014.986997 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(1):60-5. doi: 10.4161/15384047.2014.986997.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physicians' attitudes towards disclosing a patient's prognosis are likewise said to have changed, although not to the same degree. The aim of this study was to identify inherent challenges in communicating information about imminent death. It included one set of interviews with patients and another set with doctors, and subsequent discussions of ways to overcome obstacles to patients' understanding their situation. Patients were diagnosed with leukemia, myeloma, or lung cancer; the doctors were hematologists and lung oncologists. The two sets of interviews were analyzed separately using a content analysis model developed by Graneheim and Lundman. For each set of interviews, eight content areas were defined as belonging to an area of interest and scrutinized for the information they included regarding communicating prognoses to patients. The main finding was a discrepancy between patients' desire to be fully informed regarding their prognosis and physicians' reluctance to offer a prognosis until a patient had overt signs of approaching death. We conclude that existing guidelines for disclosure of bad news should be modified to encourage disclosure and discussion of uncertain prognostic information, unless a patient is clearly opposed to receiving such information or otherwise not a suitable partner for dialogue.","['Hoff, Lena', 'Hermeren, Goran']","['Hoff L', 'Hermeren G']","['Lund University, Department of Medical Ethics, BMC C:13, SE-221, Lund, sweden. lenahoff@telia.com.', 'Lund University, Department of Medical Ethics, BMC C:13, SE-221, Lund, sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Ethics,The Journal of clinical ethics,9114645,,,,2014/12/18 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['201425405 [pii]'],ppublish,J Clin Ethics. 2014 Winter;25(4):296-306.,['Copyright 2014 The Journal of Clinical Ethics.

Currently, along with advances in synthetic immunology, gene-modified T cells retargeted to defined tumor antigens have been introduced as ""cellular drugs"". As the functional properties of the adoptive immune response mediated by T lymphocytes are decisively regulated by their T-cell receptors (TCRs), transfer of genes encoding target antigen-specific receptors should enable polyclonal T cells to be uniformly redirected toward cancer cells. Clinically, anticancer adoptive immunotherapy using genetically engineered T cells has an impressive track record. Notable examples include the dramatic benefit of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene-modified T cells redirected towards CD19 in patients with B-cell malignancy, and the encouraging results obtained with TCR gene-modified T cells redirected towards NY-ESO-1, a cancer-testis antigen, in patients with advanced melanoma and synovial cell sarcoma.

We further investigated whether CML under TKI is associated with dysplastic BM changes during the clinicopathological course of the disease. METHODS: In total, pre-treatment BM paraffin blocks of biopsy specimens were available for 41 adult patients diagnosed with chronic phase CML. Post-treatment BM aspirate clot and core biopsy samples were reviewed for fibrosis and dyshematopoiesis. RESULTS: Overall, 13 (31.7%) patients achieved a complete cytogenetic response with imatinib treatment, with no events. In 25 patients, imatinib was discontinued owing to primary or secondary resistance. In patients with initial dysmyelopoiesis, the rate of BM fibrosis was 82.4 versus 47.6% for other patient groups (P = 0.02). Overall, 24 patients with newly diagnosed CML showed marrow fibrosis, among which 19 (79.1%) had imatinib resistance. However, only 5 out of 15 patients (33.5%) without marrow fibrosis had imatinib resistance (P = 0.08).

However, molecular interactions between these therapeutics have not been studied so far. A transcriptional profiling of tumor cells incubated with SFKs inhibitors revealed strong downregulation of MS4A1 gene encoding CD20 antigen. In a panel of primary and established B-cell tumors we observed that SFKs inhibitors strongly affect CD20 expression at the transcriptional level, leading to inhibition of anti-CD20 mAbs binding and increased resistance of tumor cells to complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Activation of the AKT signaling pathway significantly protected cells from dasatinib-triggered CD20 downregulation. Additionally, SFKs inhibitors suppressed antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by direct inhibition of natural killer cells. Abrogation of antitumor activity of rituximab was also observed in vivo in a mouse model. Noteworthy, the effects of SFKs inhibitors on NK cell function are largely reversible. The results of our studies indicate that development of optimal combinations of novel treatment modalities with anti-CD20 mAbs should be preceded by detailed preclinical evaluation of their effects on target cells.","['Winiarska, Magdalena', 'Bojarczuk, Kamil', 'Pyrzynska, Beata', 'Bil, Jacek', 'Siernicka, Marta', 'Dwojak, Michal', 'Bobrowicz, Malgorzata', 'Miazek, Nina', 'Zapala, Piotr', 'Zagozdzon, Agnieszka', 'Krol, Magdalena', 'Syta, Aleksandra', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka, Paulina', 'Pilch, Zofia', 'Dabrowska-Iwanicka, Anna', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Slabicki, Mikolaj', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Le Roy, Aude', 'Olive, Daniel', 'Rygiel, Tomasz P', 'Leusen, Jeanette H W', 'Golab, Jakub']","['Winiarska M', 'Bojarczuk K', 'Pyrzynska B', 'Bil J', 'Siernicka M', 'Dwojak M', 'Bobrowicz M', 'Miazek N', 'Zapala P', 'Zagozdzon A', 'Krol M', 'Syta A', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka P', 'Pilch Z', 'Dabrowska-Iwanicka A', 'Juszczynski P', 'Efremov DG', 'Slabicki M', 'Zenz T', 'Le Roy A', 'Olive D', 'Rygiel TP', 'Leusen JH', 'Golab J']","['a Department of Immunology; Center for Biostructure Research ; Medical University of Warsaw ; Warsaw , Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141030,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,PMC4622538,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity', 'BCR, B-cell receptor', 'CD20', 'CDC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity', 'CFSE, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester', 'CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'NHL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'SFKs, SRC family kinases', 'SRC family kinases', 'dasatinib', 'ofatumumab', 'rituximab']",2014/12/18 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/mabs.32106 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2014;6(5):1300-13. doi: 10.4161/mabs.32106.

We performed genomic profiling of post-MPN AML samples; these studies demonstrate somatic tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations are common in JAK2V617F-mutant, post-MPN AML but not in chronic-phase MPN and lead to clonal dominance of JAK2V617F/TP53-mutant leukemic cells. Consistent with these data, expression of JAK2V617F combined with Tp53 loss led to fully penetrant AML in vivo. JAK2V617F-mutant, Tp53-deficient AML was characterized by an expanded megakaryocyte erythroid progenitor population that was able to propagate the disease in secondary recipients. In vitro studies revealed that post-MPN AML cells were sensitive to decitabine, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, or the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 8-(6-iodobenzo[d][1.3]dioxol-5-ylthio)-9-(3-(isopropylamino)propyl)-9H-purine-6-a mine (PU-H71).

However, many patients still do not benefit from this treatment, and responders often experience immune-related toxicities. These issues highlight the need for advanced mechanistic understanding to improve patient outcomes and uncover clinically relevant biomarkers of treatment efficacy. However, the T-cell-intrinsic signaling pathways engaged during checkpoint blockade treatment are not well defined, particularly for combination approaches. Using a murine model to study how effector CD8(+) T-cell responses to tumors may be enhanced in a tolerizing environment, we identified a critical role for the T-box transcription factor T-bet. Combination blockade of CTLA-4, PD-1, and LAG-3 induced T-bet expression in responding tumor/self-reactive CD8(+) T cells. Eradication of established leukemia using this immunotherapy regimen depended on T-bet induction, which was required for IFNgamma production and cytotoxicity by tumor-infiltrating T cells, and for efficient trafficking to disseminated tumor sites. These data provide new insight into the success of checkpoint blockade for cancer immunotherapy, revealing T-bet as a key transcriptional regulator of tumor-reactive CD8(+) T-cell effector differentiation under otherwise tolerizing conditions.","['Berrien-Elliott, Melissa M', 'Yuan, Jinyun', 'Swier, Lauryn E', 'Jackson, Stephanie R', 'Chen, Collin L', 'Donlin, Maureen J', 'Teague, Ryan M']","['Berrien-Elliott MM', 'Yuan J', 'Swier LE', 'Jackson SR', 'Chen CL', 'Donlin MJ', 'Teague RM']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

A total of 263 patients with lower risk MDS (International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] low/intermediate-1 risk or Spanish Prognostic Index [SPI] 0-1 risk), transfusion-dependent, and who had received >/=10 packed red blood cells (PRBC) were included. At MDS diagnosis, patients received a mean of 2.8 +/- 3.9 PRBC/month, and 8.7% of patients showed SF >/=1000 mug/L. Over the course of the disease, patients received a mean of 83.4 +/- 83.3 PRBC, and 36.1% of patients presented SF >/=2500 mug/L.

According to investigator, iron overload was a main cause of hepatic (70.0%) and endocrine (26.9%) complications. A total of 96 (36.5%) patients received iron chelation therapy for >/=6 months, being deferasirox the most frequent first chelation treatment (71.9%). Chelation-treated patients showed longer overall survival (p < 0.001), leukemia-free survival (p = 0.007), and cardiac event-free survival (p = 0.017) than non-chelated patients.

Here we present selected clinical vignettes that highlight distinct representative situations derived from clinical practice. The vignettes are specifically discussed in light of the perspective of treating older patients with leukemia. We review the clinical significance of various cytogenetic and molecular features of the disease, and we examine the various currently available treatment options as well as the emerging prognostic algorithms that may offer guidance in regard to personalized therapy recommendations.

Using microarray-based miRNA profiling, we found that miRNA 486 (miR-486) is significantly upregulated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) compared with normal CD34(+) cells, particularly in the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor population. miR-486-5p expression increased during erythroid differentiation of both CML and normal CD34(+) cells. Ectopic miR-486-5p expression enhanced in vitro erythroid differentiation of normal CD34(+) cells, whereas miR-486-5p inhibition suppressed normal CD34(+) cell growth in vitro and in vivo and inhibited erythroid differentiation and erythroid cell survival. The effects of miR-486-5p on hematopoietic cell growth and survival are mediated at least in part via regulation of AKT signaling and FOXO1 expression. Using gene expression and bioinformatics analysis, together with functional screening, we identified several novel miR-486-5p target genes that may modulate erythroid differentiation. We further show that increased miR-486-5p expression in CML progenitors is related to both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms. Inhibition of miR-486-5p reduced CML progenitor growth and enhanced apoptosis following imatinib treatment. In conclusion, our studies reveal a novel role for miR-486-5p in regulating normal hematopoiesis and of BCR-ABL-induced miR-486-5p overexpression in modulating CML progenitor growth, survival, and drug sensitivity.","['Wang, Li-Sheng', 'Li, Ling', 'Li, Liang', 'Chu, Su', 'Shiang, Keh-Dong', 'Li, Min', 'Sun, Hui-Yan', 'Xu, Jun', 'Xiao, Feng-Jun', 'Sun, Guihua', 'Rossi, John J', 'Ho, YinWei', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Wang LS', 'Li L', 'Li L', 'Chu S', 'Shiang KD', 'Li M', 'Sun HY', 'Xu J', 'Xiao FJ', 'Sun G', 'Rossi JJ', 'Ho Y', 'Bhatia R']","[""Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA; Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, People's Republic of China; and."", 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA;', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA;', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA;', 'Department of Information Sciences and.', 'Department of Information Sciences and.', ""Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, People's Republic of China; and."", ""Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, People's Republic of China; and."", ""Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, People's Republic of China; and."", 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA;', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141216,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4335083,,,2014/12/18 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35248-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-581926 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 19;125(8):1302-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-581926.

Herein we show that the PAX5-JAK2 chimera, which consists of the DNA-binding paired domain of PAX5 and the active kinase domain of JAK2, is a nuclear protein that has the ability to bind to wild-type PAX5 target loci. Moreover, our data provide compelling evidence that PAX5-JAK2 functions as a nuclear catalytically active kinase that autophosphorylates and in turn phosphorylates and activates downstream signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) in an apparently noncanonical mode. The chimeric protein also enables cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells and therefore possesses transforming potential. Importantly, the kinase activity of PAX5-JAK2 can be efficiently blocked by JAK2 inhibitors, rendering it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Together, our data show that PAX5-JAK2 simultaneously deregulates the PAX5 downstream transcriptional program and activates the Janus kinase-STAT signaling cascade and thus, by interfering with these two important pathways, may promote leukemogenesis.","['Schinnerl, Dagmar', 'Fortschegger, Klaus', 'Kauer, Maximilian', 'Marchante, Joao R M', 'Kofler, Reinhard', 'Den Boer, Monique L', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Schinnerl D', 'Fortschegger K', 'Kauer M', 'Marchante JR', 'Kofler R', 'Den Boer ML', 'Strehl S']","[""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung e.V., Vienna, Austria;"", ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung e.V., Vienna, Austria;"", ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung e.V., Vienna, Austria;"", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and."", 'Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute and Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and."", ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung e.V., Vienna, Austria;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141216,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4375719,,,2014/12/18 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35246-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-570960 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 19;125(8):1282-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-570960.

T/myeloid (T/My) MPAL not otherwise specified (NOS) is a rare leukemia that expresses both T and myeloid antigens, accounting for less than 1% of all leukemias but 89% of T/My MPAL. From a molecular point of view, very limited data are available on T/My MPAL NOS. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report we describe a T/My MPAL NOS case with a complex rearrangement involving chromosomes 5 and 14, resulting in overexpression of the ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 2 (ADAMTS2) gene due to its juxtaposition to the T cell receptor delta (TRD) gene segment. CONCLUSION: Detailed molecular cytogenetic characterization of the complex rearrangement in the reported T/My MPAL case allowed us to observe ADAMTS2 gene overexpression, identifying a molecular marker that may be useful for monitoring minimal residual disease. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of gene dysregulation due to a chromosomal rearrangement in T/My MPAL NOS.","['Tota, Giuseppina', 'Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Casieri, Paola', 'Cellamare, Angelo', 'Minervini, Angela', 'Minervini, Crescenzio Francesco', 'Brunetti, Claudia', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Cumbo, Cosimo', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Tota G', 'Coccaro N', 'Zagaria A', 'Anelli L', 'Casieri P', 'Cellamare A', 'Minervini A', 'Minervini CF', 'Brunetti C', 'Impera L', 'Carluccio P', 'Cumbo C', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D,E,T,O,) - Hematology Section, University of Bari, P,zza G, Cesare, 11 70124 Bari, Italy. francesco.albano@uniba.it.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141216,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC4301820,,,2014/12/18 06:00,2015/08/12 06:00,['2014/12/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-963 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-963 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Dec 16;14:963. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-963.,,IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*genetics', 'ADAMTS Proteins', 'ADAMTS4 Protein', 'Adolescent', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Procollagen N-Endopeptidase/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAMTS Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.14 (ADAMTS2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.14 (Procollagen N-Endopeptidase)', 'EC 3.4.24.82 (ADAMTS4 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also has promising in vivo anticancer activity. However, the mechanisms underlying NSC-743380's selective anticancer activity remain uncharacterized. To determine biomarkers that may be used to identify responders to this novel anticancer agent, we performed correlation analysis on NSC-743380's anticancer activity and the gene expression levels in NCI-60 cell lines and characterized the functions of the top associated genes in NSC-743380-mediated anticancer activity. We found sulfotransferase SULT1A1 is causally associated with NSC-743380's anticancer activity. SULT1A1 was expressed in NSC-743380-sensitive cell lines but was undetectable in resistant cancer cells. Ectopic expression of SULT1A1 in NSC743380 resistant cancer cells dramatically sensitized the resistant cells to NSC-743380. Knockdown of the SULT1A1 in the NSC-743380 sensitive cancer cell line rendered it resistance to NSC-743380.

In acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), the fusion protein promyelocytic leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusion (PML-RARalpha) recruits transcriptional repressors to myeloid differentiation genes. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces the proteasomal degradation of PML-RARalpha and granulocytic differentiation. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) fall into four classes (I-IV) and contribute to the transcription block caused by PML-RARalpha. METHODS: Immunoblot, flow cytometry, and May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining were used to analyze differentiation and induction of apoptosis. RESULTS: A PML-RARalpha- and ATRA-dependent differentiation programme induces granulocytic maturation associated with an accumulation of the myeloid transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)varepsilon and of the surface protein CD11b. While this process protects APL cells from inhibitors of class I HDAC activity, inhibition of all Zinc-dependent HDACs (classes I, II, and IV) with the pan-HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor(s)) LBH589 induces apoptosis of immature and differentiated APL cells. LBH589 can eliminate C/EBPvarepsilon and the mitochondrial apoptosis regulator B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-xL in immature and differentiated NB4 cells. Thus, BCL-xL and C/EBPvarepsilon are newly identified molecular markers for the efficacy of HDACi against APL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results could explain the therapeutic limitations occurring with ATRA and class I HDACi combinations. Pro-apoptotic effects caused by pan-HDAC inhibition are not blunted by ATRA-induced differentiation and may provide a clinically interesting alternative.","['Hennig, D', 'Muller, S', 'Wichmann, C', 'Drube, S', 'Pietschmann, K', 'Pelzl, L', 'Grez, M', 'Bug, G', 'Heinzel, T', 'Kramer, O H']","['Hennig D', 'Muller S', 'Wichmann C', 'Drube S', 'Pietschmann K', 'Pelzl L', 'Grez M', 'Bug G', 'Heinzel T', 'Kramer OH']","['Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Hans-Knoll-Strasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'University Hospital Jena, Institute for Immunology, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Leutragraben 3, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapy and Haemostasis, Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital, Max-Lebsche Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'University Hospital Jena, Institute for Immunology, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Leutragraben 3, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Hans-Knoll-Strasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology I, Eberhard-Karls-University Tubingen, Gmelinstrasse 5, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, 60596 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Hans-Knoll-Strasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141216,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC4453449,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/03/21 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2014589 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2014.589 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2015 Jan 20;112(2):329-37. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.589.

Based on its neuroprotective and neuroregenerating properties, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family, is proposed as a novel candidate for MS therapy. However, its effect on the autoimmune response remains unclear. In this study, we determined how LIF modulates T cell responses that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS. We demonstrate that expression of the LIF receptor was strongly increased on immune cells of MS patients. LIF treatment potently boosted the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CD4(+) T cells isolated from healthy controls and MS patients with low serum levels of IL-6. Moreover, IL-6 signaling was reduced in the donors that responded to LIF treatment in vitro. Our data together with previous findings revealing that IL-6 inhibits Treg development, suggest an opposing function of LIF and IL-6. In a preclinical animal model of MS we shifted the LIF/IL-6 balance in favor of LIF by CNS-targeted overexpression. This increased the number of Tregs in the CNS during active autoimmune responses and reduced disease symptoms. In conclusion, our data show that LIF downregulates the autoimmune response by enhancing Treg numbers, providing further impetus for the use of LIF as a novel treatment for MS and other autoimmune diseases.","['Janssens, Kris', 'Van den Haute, Chris', 'Baekelandt, Veerle', 'Lucas, Sophie', 'van Horssen, Jack', 'Somers, Veerle', 'Van Wijmeersch, Bart', 'Stinissen, Piet', 'Hendriks, Jerome J A', 'Slaets, Helena', 'Hellings, Niels']","['Janssens K', 'Van den Haute C', 'Baekelandt V', 'Lucas S', 'van Horssen J', 'Somers V', 'Van Wijmeersch B', 'Stinissen P', 'Hendriks JJ', 'Slaets H', 'Hellings N']","['Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Neurobiology and Gene Therapy, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Neurobiology and Gene Therapy, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Avenue Hippocrate 75, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, Van der Boechorststraat 7, 1081 BT Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; Revalidatie & MS-Centrum, Boemerangstraat 2, 3900 Overpelt, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology, Biomedical Research Institute, Hasselt University, Agoralaan Building C, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.

However, HHT can also induce unanticipated effects in the gastrointestinal tract, such as diarrhea and nausea/vomiting, but the mechanism behind these adverse effects has not been clarified. In the present study, we show that HHT affects the epithelial permeability of intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers. HHT reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of Caco-2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The HHT effect was reversible and no cytotoxicity was observed at the concentrations used. HHT simultaneously increased the paracellular flux of the 4 kDa and 40 kDa FITC-dextrans associated with the TER reduction. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HHT decreased the protein expression of TJ components such as claudin-3, -5, and -7. However, the transcription levels of these claudins were not repressed by HHT treatment. HHT also disturbed the cellular localization of claudin-1 and -4. These changes coincided with the reduced barrier function. Our findings suggest that HHT enhances the paracellular permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayers by modulating the protein expression and localization of claudin isoforms; these actions might be responsible for the gastrointestinal effects of HHT.","['Watari, Akihiro', 'Hashegawa, Maki', 'Yagi, Kiyohito', 'Kondoh, Masuo']","['Watari A', 'Hashegawa M', 'Yagi K', 'Kondoh M']","['Laboratory of Bio-Functional Molecular Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.

Cells deploy a variety of defenses to limit the extent to which the virus can replicate. One such factor is the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, the nucleating and organizing factor of nuclear domain 10 (ND10). PML responds to a number of stimuli and is implicated in intrinsic and innate cellular antiviral defenses against HSV-1. While the role of PML in a number of cellular pathways is controlled by post-translational modifications, the effects of phosphorylation on its antiviral activity toward HSV-1 have been largely unexplored. Consequently, we mapped phosphorylation sites on PML, mutated these and other known phosphorylation sites on PML isoform I (PML-I), and examined their effects on a number of PML's activities. Our results show that phosphorylation at most sites on PML-I is dispensable for the formation of ND10s and colocalization between PML-I and the HSV-1 regulatory protein, ICP0, which antagonizes PML-I function. However, inhibiting phosphorylation at sites near the SUMO-interaction motif (SIM) of PML-I impairs its ability to respond to HSV-1 infection. Overall, our data suggest that PML phosphorylation regulates its antiviral activity against HSV-1.","['Smith, Miles C', 'Box, Andrew C', 'Haug, Jeffrey S', 'Lane, William S', 'Davido, David J']","['Smith MC', 'Box AC', 'Haug JS', 'Lane WS', 'Davido DJ']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA. milesc.smith@umassmed.edu.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research Flow Cytometry Facility, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.

We present three cases resulting in airway fistulae. CASE PRESENTATIONS: A 68-year-old male with orthotopic heart transplantation presented with fatigue, cough, and dyspnea. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest and bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial right mainstem mass and airway fistula to the mediastinum. The mass was debrided and biopsy showed Aspergillus fumigatus. He was treated with antifungals and recovered. A 52-year-old male with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presented with cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. Chest CT showed a bronchus intermedius mass and fistula to the mediastinum. Bronchoscopy revealed a necrotic endobronchial mass and pseudomembranes and confirmed the presence of a fistula. The mass was resected bronchoscopically and Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated. He was treated with antifungals and the fistula healed. A 63-year-old male with chronic lymphoid leukemia was admitted for dyspnea, cough, weakness, and dysphagia. Chest CT and bronchoscopy showed a mass causing obstruction of the subglottic trachea and a fistula to the mediastinum. Biopsy showed Aspergillus fumigatus and he was treated with antifungals. The sinus healed but the patient died of leukemia. MAIN RESULTS: Risk factors for airway aspergilloma include immune deficiency, mucosal damage, and ischemia. We report airway fistula formation as a complication of this infection, which has not been previously emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial aspergillomas may form fistulae to the mediastinum.

Non-human primates, rabbits, rats, and mice have all been used to help understand HTLV-1 biology and disease progression. Non-human primates offer a model system that is phylogenetically similar to humans for examining viral persistence. Viral transmission, persistence, and immune responses have been widely studied using New Zealand White rabbits. The advent of molecular clones of HTLV-1 has offered the opportunity to assess the importance of various viral genes in rabbits, non-human primates, and mice. Additionally, over-expression of viral genes using transgenic mice has helped uncover the importance of Tax and Hbz in the induction of lymphoma and other lymphocyte-mediated diseases. HTLV-1 inoculation of certain strains of rats results in histopathological features and clinical symptoms similar to that of humans with HAM/TSP. Transplantation of certain types of ATL cell lines in immunocompromised mice results in lymphoma. Recently, ""humanized"" mice have been used to model ATL development for the first time. Not all HTLV-1 animal models develop disease and those that do vary in consistency depending on the type of monkey, strain of rat, or even type of ATL cell line used. However, the progress made using animal models cannot be understated as it has led to insights into the mechanisms regulating viral replication, viral persistence, disease development, and, most importantly, model systems to test disease treatments.","['Panfil, Amanda R', 'Al-Saleem, Jacob J', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Panfil AR', 'Al-Saleem JJ', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, OH, USA. ; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, OH, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, OH, USA. ; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, OH, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, OH, USA. ; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, OH, USA. ; Comprenhensive Cancer Center and Solove Research Institute, OH, USA. ; Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131118,United States,Virology (Auckl),Virology : research and treatment,101515268,PMC4222344,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HAM/TSP', 'HTLV-1', 'animal model', 'mouse', 'primate', 'rabbit', 'rat']",2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.4137/VRT.S12140 [doi]', 'vrt-4-2013-049 [pii]']",epublish,Virology (Auckl). 2013 Nov 18;4:49-59. doi: 10.4137/VRT.S12140. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improved remission rates, current treatment regimens for pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia are often associated with adverse effects and central nervous system relapse, necessitating more effective and safer agents. Bafilomycin A1 is an inhibitor of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase that is frequently used at high concentration to block late-phase autophagy. Here, we show that bafilomycin A1 at a low concentration (1 nM) effectively and specifically inhibited and killed pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. It targeted both early and late stages of the autophagy pathway by activating mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and by disassociating the Beclin 1-Vps34 complex, as well as by inhibiting the formation of autolysosomes, all of which attenuated functional autophagy. Bafilomycin A1 also targeted mitochondria and induced caspase-independent apoptosis by inducing the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to the nucleus. Moreover, bafilomycin A1 induced the binding of Beclin 1 to Bcl-2, which further inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptotic cell death. In primary cells from pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a xenograft model, bafilomycin A1 specifically targeted leukemia cells while sparing normal cells. An in vivo mouse toxicity assay confirmed that bafilomycin A1 is safe. Our data thus suggest that bafilomycin A1 is a promising candidate drug for the treatment of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Yuan, Na', 'Song, Lin', 'Zhang, Suping', 'Lin, Weiwei',

LncRNAs are involved in numerous biological roles including imprinting, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. To determine whether lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older patients (aged >/=60 y) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom microarray platform. An independent set of 71 untreated older patients with CN-AML was used to validate the outcome scores using RNA sequencing. Distinctive lncRNA profiles were found associated with selected mutations, such as internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) and mutations in the NPM1, CEBPA, IDH2, ASXL1, and RUNX1 genes. Using the lncRNAs most associated with event-free survival in a training cohort of 148 older patients with CN-AML, we derived a lncRNA score composed of 48 lncRNAs. Patients with an unfavorable compared with favorable lncRNA score had a lower complete response (CR) rate [P < 0.001, odds ratio = 0.14, 54% vs. 89%], shorter disease-free survival (DFS) [P < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.88] and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001, HR = 2.95). The validation set analyses confirmed these results (CR, P = 0.03; DFS, P = 0.009; OS, P = 0.009). Multivariable analyses for CR, DFS, and OS identified the lncRNA score as an independent marker for outcome. In conclusion, lncRNA expression in AML is closely associated with recurrent mutations. A small subset of lncRNAs is correlated strongly with treatment response and survival.","['Garzon, Ramiro', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Yan, Pearlly S', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Bucci, Donna', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Blachly, James S', 'Blum, William', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Garzon R', 'Volinia S', 'Papaioannou D', 'Nicolet D', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Yan PS', 'Mrozek K', 'Bucci D', 'Carroll AJ', 'Baer MR', 'Wetzler M', 'Carter TH', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Moore JO', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Blachly JS', 'Blum W', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Stone RM', 'Marcucci G', 'Croce CM', 'Byrd JC', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210; carlo.croce@osumc.edu ramiro.garzon@osumc.edu clara.bloomfield@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery, and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, FE 44121, Italy;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210; Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210; Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294;', 'Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201;', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263;', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242;', 'The Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC 27157;', 'North Shore Cancer Institute, Lake Success, NY 11042;', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Duke University and Durham VA Medical Centers, Durham, NC 27701; and.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University, Boston, MA 02215.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210; carlo.croce@osumc.edu ramiro.garzon@osumc.edu clara.bloomfield@osumc.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210; carlo.croce@osumc.edu ramiro.garzon@osumc.edu clara.bloomfield@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141215,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC4284555,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'lncRNAs', 'outcome']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1422050112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1422050112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Dec 30;111(52):18679-84. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1422050112.

Though numerous cellular and molecular players are known, the mechanism of chemical-induced sensitization remains poorly understood. Here, we identify neutrophils as crucial players in the sensitization phase of CHS. Genetic deficiency of neutrophils caused by myeloid-specific deletion of Mcl-1 or antibody-mediated depletion of neutrophils before sensitization abrogated the CHS response. Neutrophil deficiency reduced contact allergen-induced cytokine production, gelatinase release, and reactive oxygen species production in naive mice. Mast cell deficiency inhibited neutrophil accumulation at the site of sensitization. In turn, neutrophils were required for contact allergen-induced release of further neutrophil-attracting chemokines, migration of DCs to the draining lymph nodes, and priming of allergen-specific T cells. Lymph node cells from mice sensitized in the absence of neutrophils failed to transfer sensitization to naive recipients. Furthermore, no CHS response could be induced when neutrophils were depleted before elicitation or when normally sensitized lymph node cells were transferred to neutrophil-deficient recipients, indicating an additional role for neutrophils in the elicitation phase. Collectively, our data identify neutrophils to be critically involved in both the sensitization and elicitation phase of CHS.","['Weber, Felix C', 'Nemeth, Tamas', 'Csepregi, Janka Z', 'Dudeck, Anne', 'Roers, Axel', 'Ozsvari, Bela', 'Oswald, Eva', 'Puskas, Laszlo G', 'Jakob, Thilo', 'Mocsai, Attila', 'Martin, Stefan F']","['Weber FC', 'Nemeth T', 'Csepregi JZ', 'Dudeck A', 'Roers A', 'Ozsvari B', 'Oswald E', 'Puskas LG', 'Jakob T', 'Mocsai A', 'Martin SF']","['Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine; MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine; MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine; MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine; MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine; MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institute for Immunology, Technische Universitat Dresden, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, Technische Universitat Dresden, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Avidin Ltd., 6726 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Avidin Ltd., 6726 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine; MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine; MTA-SE ""Lendulet"" Inflammation Physiology Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest, Hungary stefan.martin@uniklinik-freiburg.de mocsai.attila@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.', 'Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany stefan.martin@uniklinik-freiburg.de mocsai.attila@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141215,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC4291534,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20130062 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20130062 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2015 Jan 12;212(1):15-22. doi: 10.1084/jem.20130062.

OBJECTIVES: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and disease burden of infection-related cancers were reviewed by infectious agents. FINDINGS: Chronic infection with Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, human papillomavirus (HPV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, Helicobacter pylori, Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, and Schistosoma haematobium are associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma; lymphoma and leukemia, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma; hepatocellular carcinoma; Kaposi sarcoma; oropharyngeal carcinoma; cervical carcinoma and carcinoma of other anogential sites; adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; gastric carcinoma; cholangiocarcinoma; and urinary bladder cancer. In 2008, approximately 2 million new cancer cases (16%) worldwide were attributable to infection. If these infections could be prevented and/or treated, it is estimated that there would be about 23% fewer cancers in less developed regions of the world, and about 7% fewer cancers in more developed regions. CONCLUSION: Widespread application of existing public health methods for the prevention of infection, such as vaccination, safer injection practices, quality-assured screening of all donated blood and blood components, antimicrobial treatments, and safer sex practices, including minimizing one's lifetime number of sexual partners and condom use, could have a substantial effect on the future burden of cancer worldwide.","['Oh, Jin-Kyoung', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete']","['Oh JK', 'Weiderpass E']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; The Risk Appraisal and Prevention Branch, National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway, Department of Genetic Epidemiology, Folkhalsan Research Center, Helsinki, Finland, and Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tromso, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.

Alcohol consumption is a well-established risk factor for cancers of the head and neck, esophagus, liver, colorectum, and breast for women only. The majority of studies on tobacco and alcohol were conducted in high-income countries (HICs). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the extent of tobacco and alcohol usage and to compare the cancer burden between low- and high-income regions. FINDINGS: Overall, tobacco smoking is estimated to account for 21% of cancer deaths worldwide (29% in HICs and 18% in low- and middle-income countries [LMICs]). Alcohol consumption is estimated to account for 5% of all cancer deaths worldwide, with similar proportions in LMICs. Cancers of the breast, lung, stomach, liver, head and neck, esophagus, cervix, and nasopharynx, and leukemia are already diagnosed in greater numbers each year in less-developed countries compared with more developed countries. The future burden of tobacco- and alcohol-related cancers on less-developed regions is expected to increase greatly based on demographic effects, with a 69.9% increase in tobacco-related cancer cases and a 68% increase in cancers related to alcohol. Although HICs have experienced a decrease in tobacco prevalence in recent decades, LMICs are still in the early stages of the tobacco epidemic. CONCLUSION: Tobacco use and alcohol consumption will clearly remain important risk factors that must be targeted with public health efforts particularly in LMICs.","['Lee, Yuan-Chin Amy', 'Hashibe, Mia']","['Lee YC', 'Hashibe M']","['Division of Public Health, Department of Family & Preventive Medicine, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.

METHODS: We compared available therapies for treatment-naive, symptomatic CLL regarding progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in all the identified random control trials and in subgroups composed of younger/fit and older/unfit patients, using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. RESULTS: In younger/fit patients we obtained median of projected mean PFS of: 19, 26, 31, 43, 51 and 75months for chlorambucil, fludarabine, alemtuzumab, fludarabine with cyclophosphamide (FC), bendamustine and fludarabine with cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), respectively. We noted median OS of: 59, 66, 66, 70months for FC, chlorambucil, FCR and fludarabine, respectively. In older/unfit patients we noted PFS of: 16, 17, 24, 30, 60months for chlorambucil, fludarabine and chlorambucil with ofatumumab (OClb) or rituximab (RClb) or obinutuzumab (GClb), respectively. We obtained median OS of: 44, 58, 59 and 90months for fludarabine, RClb, chlorambucil and GClb, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that: (1) FCR has higher potential of preventing CLL progression in younger/fit patients over four therapy options, which were subject of previous meta-analysis but also over bendamustine; (2) in these patients FCR does not entail prolonging of OS in comparison with chlorambucil and it is outperformed by fludarabine; (3) in older/unfit patients GClb demonstrates longer projected PFS than all assessed comparators; (4) in this group GClb has also the highest potential of increasing OS.","['Ladyzynski, Piotr', 'Molik, Maria', 'Foltynski, Piotr']","['Ladyzynski P', 'Molik M', 'Foltynski P']","['Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Polish Academy of Sciences, 4 Trojdena Street, 02-109 Warsaw, Poland.

For chronic thrombocytopenia, transfusion has been recommended if the platelet count is less than 5000/muL. In Germany, half a million platelet transfusions are now being given every year, and the number is rising. New studies indicate, however, that a more restrictive transfusion strategy is justified. METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, with additional attention to recommendations from Germany and abroad, and to the guidelines of medical specialty societies. RESULTS: Prophylactic platelet transfusions should be given when clinically indicated in consideration of the individual hemorrhagic risk. To prevent severe hemorrhage, it is more important to respond to the first signs of bleeding than to pay exclusive attention to morning platelet counts below 10 000/muL. This threshold value remains standard for patients with acute leukemia. According to recent studies, however, clinically stable patients who are at low risk for bleeding-e.g., patients who have undergone autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation-may be well served by a therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, platelet transfusion strategy, in which platelets are transfused only when evidence of bleeding has been observed. For cancer patients, intensive-care patients, and patients with other risk factors, a clinically oriented transfusion strategy is recommended, in addition to close attention to threshold platelet values. CONCLUSION: The number of platelet transfusions could be safely lowered by a more restrictive transfusion strategy that takes account of the risk of bleeding, as recommended in the hemotherapy guidelines.","['Wandt, Hannes', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Greinacher, Andreas']","['Wandt H', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Greinacher A']","['Medical Clinic 5-Nuremberg Hospital: Internal Medicine, Oncology, Hematology, Institute of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University of Greifswald.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,PMC4269073,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2014.0809 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2014.0809 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2014 Nov 28;111(48):809-15. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2014.0809.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Germany', 'Hematology/standards', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology/standards', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Platelet Transfusion/*standards', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage/*therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Thrombocytopenia/*chemically induced/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,"['Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2015 Jul 20;112(29-30):505.

Nobiletin markedly enhanced the expression of granzyme B, a serine protease that plays critical roles in the cytolytic activity of NK cells. The potentiated cytolytic activity induced by nobiletin was canceled by the granzyme B inhibitor Z-AAD-CMK. Nobiletin also increased the levels of phosphorylated CREB, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK in KHYG-1 cells, which are known to participate in NK cell function. Inhibition of an upstream kinase of ERK1/2 failed to reduce the granzyme B expression and KHYG-1 cytolytic activity. Meanwhile, inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuated both granzyme B expression and KHYG-1 cytolytic activity.

In vitro treatment with CDDP did not induce death in quiescent CLL cells, but did induce apoptosis in CD40-ligand (and CpG) stimulated and proliferating cells, irrespective of p53 function. In the p53 dysfunctional prolymphocytic cell-line MEC1, CDDP treatment resulted in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and ABL1-dependent expression of TAp73, CDKN1A, PUMA and BID. TAp73 RNA-interference decreased sensitivity to CDDP. Finally, both in vitro stimulated CLL cells and lymph node (LN) derived CLL cells showed increased TAp73 expression in comparison with quiescent peripheral blood derived cells. Activity of CDDP may therefore be mediated by TAp73, especially in the context of activation such as occurs in the LN microenvironment.","['Tonino, Sanne H', 'Mulkens, Chantal E', 'van Laar, Jacoline', 'Derks, Ingrid A M', 'Suo, Guangli', 'Croon-de Boer, Fransien', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Wang, Jean Y', 'Kater, Arnon P']","['Tonino SH', 'Mulkens CE', 'van Laar J', 'Derks IA', 'Suo G', 'Croon-de Boer F', 'van Oers MH', 'Eldering E', 'Wang JY', 'Kater AP']","['a Department of Hematology , Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'b Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'c Laboratory for Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'c Laboratory for Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'c Laboratory for Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'd Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , Moores Cancer Center, University of California , San Diego, La Jolla , CA , USA.', 'e Department of Internal Medicine , Ikazia Hospital , Rotterdam , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Hematology , Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'b Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'b Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'c Laboratory for Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'd Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , Moores Cancer Center, University of California , San Diego, La Jolla , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Hematology , Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'b Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150121,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,PMC4592483,['NOTNLM'],"['CDDP', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'TAp73', 'drug resistance', 'p53']",2014/12/17 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.996751 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(8):2439-47. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.996751.

Deeper characterization of leukemic cell genetic abnormalities has discovered new subtypes of leukemia such as early T-cell precursor ALL and Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL, and identified many genomic alterations that have diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic implications. In this regard, several novel fusion transcripts are responsive to ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors and potentially to JAK inhibitors. Genome-wide analyses have also unraveled the role of inherited cancer predisposing genes and small nucleotide polymorphisms of several genes in the development of childhood ALL. These advances promise to lead to more sophisticated personalized treatment strategies in the near future.","['Pui, Ching-Hon']",['Pui CH'],"[""Departments of Oncology and Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA, ching-hon.pui@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141215,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-015-0381-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2015 Mar;9(1):1-9. doi: 10.1007/s11684-015-0381-3.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 253 adult patients with acute or chronic leukemia who received haploidentical allo-HSCT from August 2008 to September 2011. All conditioning regimens were myeloablative and bulsufan based. Patients were stratified according to BMI values (low BMI group: <18 kg/m(2); normal BMI group: >/= 18 and < 25 kg/m(2); overweight BMI group: >/= 25 kg/m(2)). Other possible risk factors correlated with GVHD, relapse, transplant related mortality (TRM) and overall survival (OS) included age and gender of donor and recipient, HLA disparity, relationship between donor and recipient, diagnosis, status of disease, ATG dose in conditioning regime(10 mg/kg , 6 mg/kg), mononuclear cells (MNC), CD(+)34 and CD(+)3 cell amount from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) primed bone marrow grafts (G-BM) and G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood grafts(G-PB). Cox regression analysis was used to determine the related risk factors. RESULTS: The median age of all 253 patients was 31 (18-56) years, including 128 cases with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 95 cases with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 30 cases with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). According to primary diseases, 185 patients were classified in the standard -risk group and 68 cases in the high-risk group. Median follow-up time was 929 days (range: 48-1762 days) post-transplantation. Engraftment has been attained 252 (99.6%) recipients with the median time of granulocyte and platelet recovery 12 days (ranging from 9 to 45 days) and 16 days (ranging from 7 to 180 days), respectively. Cumulative incidences of acute GVHD was 33.2% with median time of 25 days (range: 13-88 days) after transplant. Multivariate analysis identified that low BMI was associated with an increased risk of grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR = 5.736, 95%CI 1.779-18.491, P = 0.003). There was no significant impact of BMI to other manifestations of GVHD, TRM, relapse or OS in different groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a correlation between pre transplant BMI and clinical outcome post-transplant. Low BMI was associated with increased risk of severe acute GVHD in leukemia patients receiving haploidentical allo-HSCT. Meticulous supportive care pre-transplantation is required for low BMI patients.","['Chen, Yao', 'Xu, Lanping', 'Liu, Daihong', 'Liu, Kaiyan', 'Chen, Huan', 'Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Wang, Fengrong', 'Wang, Jingzhi', 'Wang, Yu', 'Han, Wei', 'Chen, Yuhong', 'Yan, Chenhua', 'Zhao, Ting', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Chen Y', 'Xu L', 'Liu D', 'Liu K', 'Chen H', 'Zhang X', 'Wang F', 'Wang J', 'Wang Y', 'Han W', 'Chen Y', 'Yan C', 'Zhao T', 'Huang X']","[""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.

A V600E mutation-specific antibody, VE1, has been recently developed. We studied the diagnostic utility of this antibody in HCL and compared it with other B-cell neoplasms. METHODS: VE1 activity was assessed using immunohistochemistry in 90 mature B-cell neoplasms, including HCL (n = 17), HCL variant (n = 6), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 20), and 47 other B-cell lymphomas. Most (87/90) specimens were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens decalcified in either hydrochloric acid or formic acid. RESULTS: VE1 was positive in 15 (88%) cases of HCL and two (10%) cases of CLL and was negative in all other tumors assessed. The VE1-positive HCL cases showed uniform staining in all tumor cells, but intensity was variable. The two VE1-negative HCL cases had BRAF V600 mutations proven by molecular analysis. The two CLL cases positive with VE1 showed an atypical staining pattern with expression in a minority of lymphoma cells. Immunohistochemistry using the VE1 antibody had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 97% for HCL.

METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with blast phase CML were identified in the Duke Pathology database from 1991 to 2011. The morphology and immunophenotype of blasts were evaluated, along with cytogenetic studies and associated findings in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. RESULTS: In the TKI era, the blasts were more frequently of a type other than the usual myeloid or lymphoid types when compared with the pre-TKI era. Blast phase in TKI-treated patients was associated with a higher peripheral WBC count and a lower blast percentage in the bone marrow. Of the 23 patients with cytogenetic studies during blast phase, additional cytogenetic changes more frequently occurred in patients with an unusual blast type, and some patients showed these changes months before the onset of blast phase. CONCLUSIONS: Blast phase CML in TKI- and non-TKI-treated patients differs in the morphology and immunophenotype of blasts, cytogenetic findings, and associated findings in the peripheral blood and bone marrow.","['Shi, Yang', 'Rand, Andrew J', 'Crow, Jennifer H', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Lagoo, Anand S']","['Shi Y', 'Rand AJ', 'Crow JH', 'Moore JO', 'Lagoo AS']","['From the Departments of Pathology and.', 'From the Departments of Pathology and.', 'From the Departments of Pathology and.', 'Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.', 'From the Departments of Pathology and anand.lagoo@duke.edu.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,['NOTNLM'],"['Blast phase', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Cytogenetics', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/02/14 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['143/1/105 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPWEX5YY4PHSCN [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jan;143(1):105-19. doi: 10.1309/AJCPWEX5YY4PHSCN.,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we sought to compare immunohistochemistry with an antibody specific for this mutation to a sensitive molecular assay. METHODS: The performance of the BRAF V600E-specific VE1 antibody was compared with that of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 22 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens with HCL involvement, along with nine splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZLs), 10 follicular lymphomas (FLs), 10 mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), and 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL/SLLs). An additional 11 SMZLs, 100 FLs, 20 MCLs, 83 CLL/SLL specimens, and 49 reactive tonsils within tissue microarrays were stained with VE1. RESULTS: A BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 17 (77.3%) of 22 HCL cases by PCR. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated VE1 staining in 20 (90.9%) cases, identifying low-level (~1%) involvement in three HCL cases that were mutation negative by PCR. Evaluation of additional material from these patients confirmed the presence of BRAF V600E. Thirty-nine non-HCL cases were negative by both methods. Within tissue microarrays, weak false-positive staining was observed in two (0.8%) of 263 non-HCL cases. CONCLUSIONS: VE1 immunohistochemistry is more sensitive than allele-specific PCR in FFPE bone marrow specimens and can be applied to decalcified core biopsy specimens that are not appropriate for molecular techniques.","['Brown, Noah A', 'Betz, Bryan L', 'Weigelin, Helmut C', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo S J', 'Lim, Megan S', 'Bailey, Nathanael G']","['Brown NA', 'Betz BL', 'Weigelin HC', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KS', 'Lim MS', 'Bailey NG']","['From the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.', 'From the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.', 'From the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.', 'From the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.', 'From the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.', 'From the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. ngbailey@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allele-specific PCR', 'Antibody', 'BRAF', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'PCR', 'VE1']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/02/14 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['143/1/89 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPDN4Q1JTFGCFC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jan;143(1):89-99. doi: 10.1309/AJCPDN4Q1JTFGCFC.,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies exist to better delineate the natural history and differences between MBL and CLL. METHODS: Applying the recently updated B-lymphocyte threshold of 5 x 10(9) B lymphocytes/L for the diagnosis of CLL, we evaluated the differences in initial presentation, disease progression, time to treatment (TTT), and 10-year overall survival rates between patients with less than 5 x 10 x 10(9)/L, 5 to 10 x 10(9)/L, and more than 10 x 10(9)/L B cells. These clinical/treatment parameters were also compared among the MBL, 5 to 10 CLL Rai stage 0, and more than 10 CLL Rai stage 0 groups. RESULTS: In total, 310 patients were included, with 67 in the less than 5, 75 in the 5 to 10, and 168 in the more than 10 B-cell groups. Statistically significant differences were seen when comparing the 5 to 10 and more than 10 B-cell groups regarding anemia (P = .021 for median hemoglobin; P = .028 for anemia <11 g/dL), platelet count (P = .041 for median platelet count), splenomegaly (P = .013), initial management plan (P = .012 for observation; P = .0021 for treatment with chemotherapy), and TTT (P = .0033). No statistically significant difference was seen among the MBL, 5 to 10, and more than 10 CLL Rai stage 0 groups regarding TTT and 10-year overall survival.

There are only limited data on flow cytometry (FCM) and cytogenetics in RS. METHODS: In this study, FCM, classic cytogenetics (CC), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed in eight RS cases. RESULTS: Most cases of RS were characterized by a loss/decrease of CD52 and CD62L and increased CD71 expression. CC identified complex karyotypes, with losses of 9/9p and 17/17p as the most frequent in four of seven cases. Seven RS cases demonstrated MYC abnormalities. Disruptions of CDKN2A and IGH were identified in five of seven and four of seven RS cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Newly diagnosed RS is an oncologic emergency, and a quick diagnostic decision is crucial in clinical practice. Therefore, in patients with CLL/SLL and rapidly enlarging asymmetric lymphadenopathy and/or extranodal tumors, we strongly advise FCM of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) material, including CD62L, CD52, and CD71 analysis as well as assessment of karyotype and at least MYC abnormalities by FISH of the same FNAB material. Loss of CD52 expression in RS most likely predicts resistance to alemtuzumab therapy, which is frequently used in CLL.","['Woroniecka, Renata', 'Rymkiewicz, Grzegorz', 'Grygalewicz, Beata', 'Blachnio, Katarzyna', 'Rygier, Jolanta', 'Jarmuz-Szymczak, Malgorzata', 'Ratajczak, Blazej', 'Pienkowska-Grela, Barbara']","['Woroniecka R', 'Rymkiewicz G', 'Grygalewicz B', 'Blachnio K', 'Rygier J', 'Jarmuz-Szymczak M', 'Ratajczak B', 'Pienkowska-Grela B']","['From the Cancer Genetics Laboratory and renatawr@coi.waw.pl.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory of the Pathology Department and Laboratory Diagnostics, the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute and Cancer Centre, Warszawa, Poland;', 'From the Cancer Genetics Laboratory and.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory of the Pathology Department and Laboratory Diagnostics, the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute and Cancer Centre, Warszawa, Poland;', 'From the Cancer Genetics Laboratory and.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland; and Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland; and.', 'From the Cancer Genetics Laboratory and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alemtuzumab in CLL', 'CD52, CD62L, CD71', 'Flow cytometry', 'MYC, CDKN2A, IGH', 'Richter syndrome']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/02/14 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['143/1/25 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPATRQWANW2O3N [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jan;143(1):25-35. doi: 10.1309/AJCPATRQWANW2O3N.,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'Glycoproteins/deficiency/metabolism', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the Cytoscape software. Using the Rank Product package for leukemia, we identified a total of 1294 differentially expressed genes, 357 of which were not involved in individual differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology-enrichment analyses showed that these 357 genes were enriched in biological processes such as mRNA metabolism, RNA splicing, and mRNA processing. Pathway-enrichment analysis showed that the genes were involved in the intestinal immune network for IgA production, endocytosis, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. The protein-protein interaction network indicated that HRAS, CD44, STAT1, SMAD2, and COPS5 were important in many interactions.

Spirometry was measured using a spirometer Microloop Viasys((R)) in accordance with American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines. Maximal respiratory pressures were measured with an MVD300 digital manometer (Globalmed((R))). Maximal inspiratory pressures and maximal expiratory pressures were measured from residual volume and total lung capacity, respectively. RESULTS: Group A showed a significant decrease in maximal inspiratory pressures when compared to group B. No significant difference was found between the spirometric values of the two groups, nor was there any difference between maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure values in group A compared to the lower limit values proposed as reference.

The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of perinatal infections in an area in Japan and investigate some risk factors associated with infection. Altogether, 129 calves born to BLV-infected cows in a herd in Japan were tested for infection immediately after birth and again at one month of age using nested PCR. Twenty-four calves (18.6 per cent) were infected with BLV, of which 14 (10.8 per cent) and 10 (7.7 per cent) calves were infected via the transplacental and the birth canal routes, respectively. Maternal viral loads, breed, the presence or absence of assistance during parturition and the number of births per dam were evaluated to investigate risk factors associated with infection. Maternal viral load was significantly correlated with the frequency of perinatal infection, and more than 40 per cent of newborn calves born to dams with high viral loads were infected with BLV. The results of this study could contribute towards developing effective eradication programmes by providing necessary data for replacement of breeding cow in the field.","['Mekata, Hirohisa', 'Sekiguchi, Satoshi', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Kirino, Yumi', 'Honkawa, Kazuyuki', 'Nonaka, Nariaki', 'Horii, Yoichiro', 'Norimine, Junzo']","['Mekata H', 'Sekiguchi S', 'Konnai S', 'Kirino Y', 'Honkawa K', 'Nonaka N', 'Horii Y', 'Norimine J']","['Project for Zoonoses Education and Research, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Animal Infectious Disease and Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 18 Nishi 9, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan.', 'Project for Zoonoses Education and Research, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitic Diseases, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitic Diseases, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan.', 'Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitic Diseases, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan.', 'Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitic Diseases, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Animal Infectious Disease and Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuen-Kibanadai-Nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141215,England,Vet Rec,The Veterinary record,0031164,,['NOTNLM'],"['Calves', 'Cattle', 'PCR', 'Retroviruses']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/05/28 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['vr.102464 [pii]', '10.1136/vr.102464 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Rec. 2015 Mar 7;176(10):254. doi: 10.1136/vr.102464.

Here, we showed that homodimeric NUP98-RARG not only acquired unique nuclear localization pattern and ability of recruiting both RXRA and wild-type NUP98, but also exhibited similar transcriptional properties as RARA fusions found in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Using murine bone marrow retroviral transduction/transformation assay, we further demonstrated that NUP98-RARG fusion protein had gained transformation ability of primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which was critically dependent on the C-terminal GLFG domain of NUP98 and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of RARG. In contrast to other NUP98 fusions, cells transformed by the NUP98-RARG fusion were extremely sensitive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. Interestingly, while pan-RXR agonists, SR11237 and LGD1069 could specifically inhibit NUP98-RARG transformed cells, mutation of the RXR interaction domain in NUP98-RARG had little effect on its transformation, revealing that therapeutic functions of rexinoid can be independent of the direct biochemical interaction between RXR and the fusion. Together, these results indicate that deregulation of the retinoid/rexinoid signaling pathway has a major role and may represent a potential therapeutic target for NUP98-RARG-mediated transformation.","['Qiu, J J', 'Zeisig, B B', 'Li, S', 'Liu, W', 'Chu, H', 'Song, Y', 'Giordano, A', 'Schwaller, J', 'Gronemeyer, H', 'Dong, S', 'So, C W E']","['Qiu JJ', 'Zeisig BB', 'Li S', 'Liu W', 'Chu H', 'Song Y', 'Giordano A', 'Schwaller J', 'Gronemeyer H', 'Dong S', 'So CW']","['1] Department of Medicine, Dan L.

Finally, recent clinical work targeting eIF4E in acute myeloid leukemia patients with ribavirin is discussed. In summary, these findings provide a novel paradigm for eIF4E function and the molecular basis for targeting it in leukemia patients.","['Osborne, Michael J', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Osborne MJ', 'Borden KL']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer & Dept. of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,PMC4269245,['NOTNLM'],"['PML', 'clinical trials', 'eIF4E', 'mRNA export', 'ribavirin']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12240 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2015 Jan;263(1):210-23. doi: 10.1111/imr.12240.,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

During normal early B-cell development, survival and proliferation signals are dominated by cytokines, particularly interleukin-7 (IL-7) for murine developing B cells. With expression of a functional pre-B-cell receptor (BCR), cytokine signaling is attenuated and the tonic/autonomous pre-BCR signaling pathway provides proliferation as well as differentiation signals. In this review, we first describe checkpoint mechanisms during normal B-cell development and then discuss how genetic lesions in these pathways function as oncogenic mimicries and allow transformed pre-B cells to bypass checkpoint control. We focus on cytokine receptor signaling that is mimicked by activating lesions in receptor subunits or downstream mediators as well as aberrant activation of non-B lymphoid cytokine receptors. Furthermore, we describe the molecular switch from cytokine receptor to pre-BCR signaling, how this pathway is of particular importance for certain ALL subtypes, and how pre-BCR signaling is engaged by genetic lesions, such as BCR-ABL1. We discuss the transcriptional control mechanisms downstream of both cytokine- and pre-BCR signaling and how normal checkpoint control mechanisms are circumvented in pre-B ALL. Finally, we highlight new therapeutic concepts for targeted inhibition of oncogenic cytokine or pre-BCR signaling pathways.","['Buchner, Maike', 'Swaminathan, Srividya', 'Chen, Zhengshan', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Buchner M', 'Swaminathan S', 'Chen Z', 'Muschen M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cytokine receptor signaling', 'oncogenic mimicry', 'pre-B-cell receptor checkpoint']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12235 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2015 Jan;263(1):192-209. doi: 10.1111/imr.12235.,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, the CML community is faced with several clinical issues that need to be addressed. Ten to 15% of CML patients are diagnosed in advanced phase, and small numbers of chronic phase (CP) cases experience disease progression each year during treatment. For these patients, TKIs induce only transient responses and alternative treatment strategies are urgently required. Depending on choice of first line TKI, approximately 30% of CML CP cases show suboptimal responses, due to a combination of poor compliance, drug intolerance, and drug resistance, with approximately 50% of TKI-resistance caused by kinase domain mutations and the remainder due to unknown mechanisms. Finally, the chance of successful treatment discontinuation is on the order of only 10-20% related to disease persistence. Disease persistence is a poorly understood phenomenon; all CML patients have functional Philadelphia positive (Ph+) stem and progenitor cells in their bone marrows and continue to express BCR-ABL1 by DNA PCR, even when in very deep remission and following treatment discontinuation. What controls the maintenance of these persisting cells, whether it is necessary to fully eradicate the malignant clone to achieve cure, and how that might be approached therapeutically are open questions.","['Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Helgason, G Vignir']","['Holyoake TL', 'Helgason GV']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CML stem cells', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'oncogene addiction', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12234 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2015 Jan;263(1):106-23. doi: 10.1111/imr.12234.,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

During this maturation process, cooperation between a variety of oncogenes and tumor suppressors can drive immature thymocytes into uncontrolled clonal expansion and cause T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Despite improved insights in T-ALL disease biology and comprehensive characterization of its genetic landscape, clinical care remained largely similar over the past decades and still consists of high-dose multi-agent chemotherapy potentially followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Even with such aggressive treatment regimens, which are often associated with considerable side effects, clinical outcome is still extremely poor in a significant subset of T-ALL patients as a result of therapy resistance or hematological relapses. Recent genetic studies have identified recurrent somatic alterations in genes involved in DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications in T-ALL, suggesting that epigenetic homeostasis is critically required in restraining tumor development in the T-cell lineage. In this review, we provide an overview of the epigenetic regulators that could be implicated in T-ALL disease biology and speculate how the epigenetic landscape of T-ALL could trigger the development of epigenetic-based therapies to further improve the treatment of human T-ALL.","['Peirs, Sofie', 'Van der Meulen, Joni', 'Van de Walle, Inge', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['Peirs S', 'Van der Meulen J', 'Van de Walle I', 'Taghon T', 'Speleman F', 'Poppe B', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-ALL', 'epigenetics', 'therapeutics']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12237 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2015 Jan;263(1):50-67. doi: 10.1111/imr.12237.,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Cancer cells display highly dysregulated DNA methylation profiles characterized by global hypomethylation in conjunction with hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands that presumably lead to genome instability and aberrant expression of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. The recent discovery of ten-eleven-translocation (TET) family dioxygenases that oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) in DNA has led to profound progress in understanding the mechanism underlying DNA demethylation. Among the three TET genes, TET2 recurrently undergoes inactivating mutations in a wide range of myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. TET2 functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor particularly in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in human. Here we review diverse functions of TET proteins and the novel epigenetic marks that they generate in DNA methylation/demethylation dynamics and normal and malignant hematopoietic differentiation. The impact of TET2 inactivation in hematopoiesis and various mechanisms modulating the expression or activity of TET proteins are also discussed. Furthermore, we also present evidence that TET2 and TET3 collaborate to suppress aberrant hematopoiesis and hematopoietic transformation. A detailed understanding of the normal and pathological functions of TET proteins may provide new avenues to develop novel epigenetic therapies for treating hematological malignancies.","['Ko, Myunggon', 'An, Jungeun', 'Pastor, William A', 'Koralov, Sergei B', 'Rajewsky, Klaus', 'Rao, Anjana']","['Ko M', 'An J', 'Pastor WA', 'Koralov SB', 'Rajewsky K', 'Rao A']","['Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,PMC4617313,['NOTNLM'],"['5-methylcytosine oxidation', 'TET proteins', 'hematopoiesis', 'lymphoid malignancies', 'malignant transformation', 'myeloid malignancies']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12239 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2015 Jan;263(1):6-21. doi: 10.1111/imr.12239.,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: hBMSCs at passage 4 were divided into 4 groups according to different culture conditions: cells were treated with complete medium (a-MEM containing 10%FBS, group A), with complete medium containing 10 ng/mL LIF (group B), with complete medium containing 10 ng/mL bFGF (group C), and with complete medium containing 10 ng/mL LIF and 10 ng/mL bFGF (group D). The growth curves of hBMSCs at passage 4 in different groups were assayed by cell counting kit 8; cellular morphologic changes were observed under inverted phase contrast microscope; the surface markers of hBMSCs at passage 8 including CD44, CD90, CD19, and CD34 were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The cell growth curves of each group were similar to the S-shape; the cell proliferation rates in 4 groups were in sequence of group D > group C > group B > group A. Obvious senescence and differentiation were observed very early in group A, cells in group B maintained good cellular morphology at the early stage, with slow proliferation and late senescence; a few cells in group C differentiated into nerve-like cells, with quick proliferation; and the cells in group D grew quickly and maintained cellular morphology of hBMSCs. The expressions of CD44 and CD90 in groups A and C at passage 8 cells were lower than those of groups B and D; the expressions of CD19 and CD34 were negative in 4 groups, exhibiting no obvious difference between groups.

Identified structural and functional peculiarities of white blood cells from the patients with leukemia can be used for prognosis of the cancer progression.","['Sladkova, E A', 'Skorkina, M Iu']","['Sladkova EA', 'Skorkina MIu']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,,,,2013/01/01 00:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2014/12/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 2013;55(6):388-93.,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Size', 'Elastic Modulus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predominant clinical presentation in 50% of patients involves recurrent, often severe, infections. Infections are also the most common (60-80%) cause of deaths in CLL patients. The scope of infections varies with the clinical stage of the disease. Treatment-naive patients typically present with respiratory tract infections caused by encapsulated bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Since 2012, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has been recommended in the United States and some EU countries for pneumococcal infection prevention in patients with CLL (besides the long-standing standard, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, PPV23). The aim of this study was to compare the immune response to PCV13 in 24 previously untreated CLL patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: Both groups were evaluated for: the levels of specific pneumococcal antibodies, the levels of IgG and IgG subclasses and selected peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations including the frequency of plasmablasts before and after immunization. RESULTS: Adequate response to vaccination, defined as an at least two-fold increase in specific pneumococcal antibody titers versus pre-vaccination baseline titers, was found in 58.3% of CLL patients and 100% of healthy subjects. Both the CLL group and the control group demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the IgG2 subclass levels following vaccination (P = 0.0301). After vaccination, the frequency of plasmablasts was significantly lower (P<0.0001) in CLL patients in comparison to that in controls. Patients who responded to vaccination had lower clinical stage of CLL as well as higher total IgG, and IgG2 subclass levels. No significant vaccine-related side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 vaccination in CLL patients is safe and induces an effective immune response in a considerable proportion of patients. To achieve an optimal vaccination response, the administration of PCV13 is recommended as soon as possible following CLL diagnosis.","['Pasiarski, Marcin', 'Rolinski, Jacek', 'Grywalska, Ewelina', 'Stelmach-Goldys, Agnieszka', 'Korona-Glowniak, Izabela', 'Gozdz, Stanislaw', 'Hus, Iwona', 'Malm, Anna']","['Pasiarski M', 'Rolinski J', 'Grywalska E', 'Stelmach-Goldys A', 'Korona-Glowniak I', 'Gozdz S', 'Hus I', 'Malm A']","['Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', ""Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland; St. John's Cancer Center, Lublin, Poland."", ""Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland; St. John's Cancer Center, Lublin, Poland."", 'Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Chemotherapy and Clinical Oncology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland; Faculty of Health Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141215,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4266633,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0114966 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-36031 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 15;9(12):e114966. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0114966. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumococcal Infections/blood/*complications/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/immunology', 'Vaccines, Conjugate/immunology/*therapeutic use']","['0 (13-valent pneumococcal vaccine)', '0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Conjugate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its wide application, imatinib resistance occurs in 20-30% of individuals with CML. Multiple potential biomarkers have been identified to predict imatinib response; however, the majority of them remain externally uncorroborated. In this study, we set out to systematically identify gene/microRNA (miRNA) whose expression changes are related to imatinib response. Through a Gene Expression Omnibus search, we identified two genome-wide expression datasets that contain expression changes in response to imatinib treatment in a CML cell line (K562): one for mRNA and the other for miRNA. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts/miRNAs post imatinib treatment were identified from both datasets. Three additional filtering criteria were applied 1) miRbase/miRanda predictive algorithm; 2) opposite direction of imatinib effect for genes and miRNAs; and 3) literature support. These criteria narrowed our candidate gene-miRNA to a single pair: IL8 and miR-493-5p. Using PCR we confirmed the significant up-regulation and down-regulation of miR-493-5p and IL8 by imatinib treatment, respectively in K562 cells. In addition, IL8 expression was significantly down-regulated in K562 cells 24 hours after miR-493-5p mimic transfection (p = 0.002). Furthermore, we demonstrated significant cellular growth inhibition after IL8 inhibition through either gene silencing or by over-expression of miR-493-5p (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.001 respectively). The IL8 inhibition also further sensitized K562 cells to imatinib cytotoxicity (p < 0.0001). Our study combined expression changes in transcriptome and miRNA after imatinib exposure to identify a potential gene-miRNA pair that is a critical target in imatinib response. Experimental validation supports the relationships between IL8 and miR-493-5p and between this gene-miRNA pair and imatinib sensitivity in a CML cell line. Our data suggests integrative analysis of multiple omic level data may provide new insight into biomarker discovery as well as mechanisms of imatinib resistance.","['Bhutra, Steven', 'Lenkala, Divya', 'LaCroix, Bonnie', 'Ye, Meng', 'Huang, R Stephanie']","['Bhutra S', 'Lenkala D', 'LaCroix B', 'Ye M', 'Huang RS']","['Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'The Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America; The Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141215,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4266614,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0115003 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-32619 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 15;9(12):e115003. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115003. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']","['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,"['UL1 TR000430/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA125183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL096383/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 GM089941/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA139278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08GM089941/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5R25HL096383-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR024999/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024999/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA125183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cooperation with arsenic trioxide and glycolytic inhibitors, and regulation by oxidative stress and protein kinase activities.",e115250,10.1371/journal.pone.0115250 [doi],"Fatty acid synthesis and oxidation are frequently exacerbated in leukemia cells, and may therefore represent a target for therapeutic intervention. In this work we analyzed the apoptotic and chemo-sensitizing action of the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor etomoxir in human acute myeloid leukemia cells. Etomoxir caused negligible lethality at concentrations up to 100 microM, but efficaciously cooperated to cause apoptosis with the anti-leukemic agent arsenic trioxide (ATO, Trisenox), and with lower efficacy with other anti-tumour drugs (etoposide, cisplatin), in HL60 cells. Etomoxir-ATO cooperation was also observed in NB4 human acute promyelocytic cells, but not in normal (non-tumour) mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Biochemical determinations in HL60 cells indicated that etomoxir (25-200 microM) dose-dependently inhibited mitochondrial respiration while slightly stimulating glycolysis, and only caused marginal alterations in total ATP content and adenine nucleotide pool distribution. In addition, etomoxir caused oxidative stress (increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, decrease in reduced glutathione content), as well as pro-apoptotic LKB-1/AMPK pathway activation, all of which may in part explain the chemo-sensitizing capacity of the drug. Etomoxir also cooperated with glycolytic inhibitors (2-deoxy-D-glucose, lonidamine) to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells, but not in NB4 cells. The combined etomoxir plus 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment did not increase oxidative stress, caused moderate decrease in net ATP content, increased the AMP/ATP ratio with concomitant drop in energy charge, and caused defensive Akt and ERK kinase activation. Apoptosis generation by etomoxir plus 2-deoxy-D-glucose was further increased by co-incubation with ATO, which is apparently explained by the capacity of ATO to attenuate Akt and ERK activation. In summary, co-treatment with etomoxir may represent an interesting strategy to increase the apoptotic efficacy of ATO and (with some limitations) 2-deoxy-D-glucose which, although clinically important anti-tumour agents, exhibit low efficacy in monotherapy.","['Estan, Maria Cristina', 'Calvino, Eva', 'Calvo, Susana', 'Guillen-Guio, Beatriz', 'Boyano-Adanez, Maria Del Carmen', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Rial, Eduardo', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Estan MC', 'Calvino E', 'Calvo S', 'Guillen-Guio B', 'Boyano-Adanez Mdel C', 'de Blas E', 'Rial E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid, Spain; Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141215,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4266683,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0115250 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-32201 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 15;9(12):e115250. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115250. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxyglucose/*therapeutic use', 'Epoxy Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/drug effects']","['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Oxides)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'MSB3DD2XP6 (etomoxir)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'U78804BIDR (lonidamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS remains a disease of elderly patients; moreover, the incidence of high risk MDS is proportionally greater in elderly patients, with increased frequency of secondary acute myeloid leukemia, as well as adverse cytogenetic abnormalities. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a therapeutic approach with known curative potential for patients with MDS that allows the achievement of long-term disease control. Numerous controversies still exist regarding transplantation in MDS: timing of transplantation, disease status at transplantation and comorbidity, conditioning intensity, pretransplant therapy, and stem cell source. Various transplant modalities of different intensities and alternative donor sources are now in use. Current advances in transplant technology are allowing the consideration of older patients. This should result in a greater number of older patients benefiting from this potentially curative treatment modality. Despite advances in transplantation technology, there is still considerable morbidity and mortality associated with this approach. Nevertheless, with the introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning and thereby reduced early mortality, transplant numbers in MDS patients have significantly increased. Moreover, recent new developments with innovative drugs, including hypomethylating agents, have extended the therapeutic alternatives for MDS patients. Hypomethylating agents allow the delay of allogeneic stem cell transplantation by serving as an effective and well-tolerated means to reduce disease burden.","['Blau, Olga', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang']","['Blau O', 'Blau IW']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141204,New Zealand,Stem Cells Cloning,Stem cells and cloning : advances and applications,101535817,PMC4260682,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'reduced-intensity conditioning']",2014/12/17 06:00,2014/12/17 06:01,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/SCCAA.S50514 [doi]', 'sccaa-7-101 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cells Cloning. 2014 Dec 4;7:101-8. doi: 10.2147/SCCAA.S50514. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that induction of the SYK gene expression in human cells causes a significant down-regulation of evolutionarily conserved genes associated with mitosis and cell cycle progression providing unprecedented evidence that SYK is a master regulator of cell cycle regulatory checkpoint genes in human cells. We further show that SYK regulates the G2 checkpoint by physically associating with and inhibiting the dual-specificity phosphatase CDC25C via phosporylation of its S216 residue. SYK depletion by RNA interference or treatment with the chemical SYK inhibitor prevented nocodazole-treated human cell lines from activating the G2 checkpoint via CDC25C S216-phoshorylation and resulted in polyploidy. Our study provides genetic and biochemical evidence that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has a unique role in the activation of the G2 checkpoint in both nonlymphohematopoietic and B-lineage lymphoid cells. This previously unknown role of SYK as a cell cycle checkpoint regulator represents an unforeseen and significant challenge for inhibitors of SYK ATP binding site.,"['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Ma, Hong', 'Ozer, Zahide', 'Goodman, Patricia', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Qazi, Sanjive']","['Uckun FM', 'Ma H', 'Ozer Z', 'Goodman P', 'Zhang J', 'Qazi S']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 ; Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 ; Molecular Oncology Program, Parker Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA; USA."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 ; Molecular Oncology Program, Parker Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA; USA."", 'Molecular Oncology Program, Parker Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA; USA ; Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Science, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108.', 'Medicinal Bioinformatics Center, Shanghai Jiatong University.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 ; Molecular Oncology Program, Parker Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA; USA ; Department of Biology and Bioinformatics Program, Gustavus Adolphus College, 800 W College Avenue, St. Peter, MN 56082, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,EBioMedicine,EBioMedicine,101647039,PMC4259291,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell cycle', 'checkpoint control', 'genomnic instability', 'phosphatase', 'tyrosine kinase']",2014/12/17 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.ebiom.2014.10.019 [doi]'],ppublish,EBioMedicine. 2014 Nov 1;1(1):16-28. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2014.10.019.,,,,,,,"['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS644171'],,,,,,,,,,,

Atthe same time, the short range radiation spares adjacent normal tissues. This targeted approach complements conventional external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Such therapies fail on several fronts, such as lack of control of some primary cancers (e.g. glioblastoma multiforme) and to inhibit the development of lethal metastaticcancer after successful treatment of the primary cancer. OBJECTIVE: This review charts the developing role of systemic high LET, internalradiation therapy. METHOD: Targeted alpha therapy is a rapidly advancing experimental therapy thatholds promise to deliver high cytotoxicity to targeted cancer cells. Initially thoughtto be indicated for leukemia and micrometastases, there is now evidence that solidtumors can also be regressed. RESULTS: Alpha therapy may be molecular or physiological in its targeting. Alphaemitting radioisotopes such as Bi-212, Bi-213, At-211 and Ac-225 are used to labelmonoclonal antibodies or proteins that target specific cancer cells. Alternatively, Radium-233 is used for palliative therapy of breast and prostate cancers because of its bone seeking properties.

Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are over-expressed in CLL, suggesting both a role in disease pathogenesis and the potential for therapeutic targeting. To explore these questions, we evaluated the effects on primary CLL cells of AZD5582, a novel potent and selective inhibitor of IAPs. AZD5582 at nanomolar concentrations induced extensive degradation of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, but minimally of X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP). However, these effects of AZD5582 produced little or no direct cytotoxicity, nor did they sensitize CLL cells to p53-dependent killing by fludarabine or p53-independent killing by dexamethasone. In contrast, AZD5582 significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by the death receptor (DR) agonist tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Importantly, killing by TRAIL plus AZD5582 was independent of adverse prognostic features including TP53 deletion which is strongly associated with chemoresistance in CLL. Coculture experiments involving transfected mouse fibroblasts expressing human CD40L (CD154) to mimic the effect of T cells at sites of tissue involvement showed that CD40 stimulation almost completely prevented the killing of CLL cells by TRAIL plus AZD5582 despite up-regulating TRAIL receptors 1 and 2. In conclusion, our findings confirm the rate-limiting, upstream involvement of IAPs in the extrinsic but not intrinsic apoptotic pathway of CLL cells and suggest that drug combinations that simultaneously activate DRs and inhibit IAPs may have therapeutic potential in patients with CLL who have failed T-cell-depleting chemotherapy.","['Zhuang, Jianguo', 'Laing, Naomi', 'Oates, Melanie', 'Lin, Ke', 'Johnson, Gillian', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Zhuang J', 'Laing N', 'Oates M', 'Lin K', 'Johnson G', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'AstraZeneca R&D Boston Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool Liverpool, United Kingdom ; Royal Liverpool & Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool Liverpool, United Kingdom ; Royal Liverpool & Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool Liverpool, United Kingdom ; Royal Liverpool & Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140901,United States,Pharmacol Res Perspect,Pharmacology research & perspectives,101626369,PMC4186455,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'CD40-stimulation', 'CLL', 'IAPs', 'TRAIL']",2014/12/17 06:00,2014/12/17 06:01,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/prp2.81 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Res Perspect. 2014 Dec;2(6):e00081. doi: 10.1002/prp2.81.

A major limitation to most conventional low-molecular weight anticancer chemotherapeutics is their unfavourable uptake by healthy tissue, fast metabolism and lack of tumour cell selectivity. One way to solve this problem is the application of hybrid nanoparticles containing widely known therapeutic substances. This study was performed with the aim of investigating the potential of use hydroxyethyl starch (HES) as a high-molecular weight carrier for anticancer drug (methotrexate, MTX). HES-MTX conjugates were characterized in terms of MTX content, hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, and drug release kinetics. In vitro biological characteristics were determined using different cancer cell lines. The antitumor effect in vivo was tested in NOD/SCID mice subcutaneously inoculated with MV-4-11 human leukaemia cells and CDF1 mice intraperitoneally inoculated with P388 murine leukaemia cells. The in vivo experiments revealed the considerably higher antitumor efficacy of HES-MTX conjugates in comparison to unconjugated drug. The results presented in this article demonstrate that the application of HES as an anticancer drug carrier can improve the treatment efficacy and have significant implications for the future design and implementation of drug-carrier conjugates. The study should help create new opportunities in the design of HES-based innovative drug-carrier conjugates.","['Goszczynski, T M', 'Filip-Psurska, B', 'Kempinska, K', 'Wietrzyk, J', 'Boratynski, J']","['Goszczynski TM', 'Filip-Psurska B', 'Kempinska K', 'Wietrzyk J', 'Boratynski J']","['""Neolek"" Laboratory, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy PAS, 12 Rudolf Weigl St., 53-114, Wroclaw, Poland.', '""Neolek"" Laboratory, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy PAS, 12 Rudolf Weigl St., 53-114, Wroclaw, Poland.', '""Neolek"" Laboratory, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy PAS, 12 Rudolf Weigl St., 53-114, Wroclaw, Poland.', '""Neolek"" Laboratory, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy PAS, 12 Rudolf Weigl St., 53-114, Wroclaw, Poland.', '""Neolek"" Laboratory, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy PAS, 12 Rudolf Weigl St., 53-114, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140506,United States,Pharmacol Res Perspect,Pharmacology research & perspectives,101626369,PMC4186415,['NOTNLM'],"['Antitumor activity', 'drug delivery systems', 'hydroxyethyl starch', 'methotrexate', 'polymer-drug conjugate']",2014/12/17 06:00,2014/12/17 06:01,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/prp2.47 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Res Perspect. 2014 Jun;2(3):e00047. doi: 10.1002/prp2.47.

Similarly, expression of CD38 on CLL cells correlates with CLL cell survival and proliferation, but the mechanisms that regulate CD38 expression and inflammatory cytokines remain unclear. We have recently demonstrated that patients have CLL-specific Th cells that support CLL proliferation. In this article, we show that CLL cells attract such Th cells, thereby establishing an Ag-dependent collaboration. Blocking experiments performed in vitro as wells as in vivo, using a xenograft model, revealed that secretion of IFN-gamma was a major mechanism by which CLL-specific Th cells increased CD38 on CLL cells. The expression of the transcription factor T-bet in peripheral blood CLL cells significantly correlated with CD38 expression, and transient transfection of CLL cells with T-bet resulted in T-bet(hi)CD38(hi) cells. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that T-bet can bind to regulatory regions of the CD38 gene. These data suggest that CLL cells attract CLL-specific Th cells and initiate a positive feedback loop with upregulation of T-bet, CD38, and type 1 chemokines allowing further recruitment of Th cells and increased type 1 cytokine secretion. This insight provides a cellular and molecular mechanism that links the inflammatory signature observed in CLL pathogenesis with CD38 expression and aggressive disease and suggests that targeting the IFN-gamma/IFN-gammaR/JAK/STAT/T-bet/CD38 pathway could play a role in the therapy of CLL.","['Burgler, Simone', 'Gimeno, Aleix', 'Parente-Ribes, Anna', 'Wang, Dong', 'Os, Audun', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Jebsen, Peter', 'Bogen, Bjarne', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E', 'Munthe, Ludvig A']","['Burgler S', 'Gimeno A', 'Parente-Ribes A', 'Wang D', 'Os A', 'Devereux S', 'Jebsen P', 'Bogen B', 'Tjonnfjord GE', 'Munthe LA']","[""Centre for Immune Regulation, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, University Children's Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; Simone.Buergler@kispi.uzh.ch ludvig@medisin.uio.no gtjonnfj@ous-hf.no."", 'Centre for Immune Regulation, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway;', 'Centre for Immune Regulation, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway;', 'Centre for Immune Regulation, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway;', 'Centre for Immune Regulation, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway;', ""Department of Hematological Medicine, King's College London, London SE5 9RS, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Pathology, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Centre for Immune Regulation, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway; K.

However, little is known about the target genes that explain leukemogenesis in these mice. In this study we found that immature B cells were altered in frequency in the bone marrow of preleukemic CD19-CreDeltaPB mice. Enriched pro-B cells from CD19-CreDeltaPB mice induced disease upon transplantation, suggesting that these were leukemia-initiating cells. Bone marrow cells from preleukemic CD19-CreDeltaPB mice had increased responsiveness to IL-7 and could proliferate indefinitely in response to this cytokine. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), a negative regulator of IL-7 signaling, was reduced in preleukemic and leukemic CD19-CreDeltaPB cells compared with controls. Induction of PU.1 expression in cultured CD19-CreDeltaPB pro-B cell lines induced Btk expression, followed by reduced STAT5 phosphorylation and early apoptosis. PU.1 and Spi-B regulated Btk directly as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Ectopic expression of BTK was sufficient to induce apoptosis in cultured pro-B cells. In summary, these results suggest that PU.1 and Spi-B activate Btk to oppose IL-7 responsiveness in developing B cells.","['Christie, Darah A', 'Xu, Li S', 'Turkistany, Shereen A', 'Solomon, Lauren A', 'Li, Stephen K H', 'Yim, Edmund', 'Welch, Ian', 'Bell, Gillian I', 'Hess, David A', 'DeKoter, Rodney P']","['Christie DA', 'Xu LS', 'Turkistany SA', 'Solomon LA', 'Li SK', 'Yim E', 'Welch I', 'Bell GI', 'Hess DA', 'DeKoter RP']","['Centre for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada;', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada;', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada;', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada;', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada;', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada;', 'Department of Animal Care and Veterinary Services, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada;', 'Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada; and.', ""Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada; and Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, Ontario N6C 2R5, Canada."", ""Centre for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada; Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, Ontario N6C 2R5, Canada rdekoter@uwo.ca.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401569 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401569 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Jan 15;194(2):595-605. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401569.

Most of these are short-lived effector T cells (SLECs) that die after clearance of the virus. However, a small proportion of this population survives and forms antigen-specific memory precursor effector cells (MPECs), which ultimately develop into memory cells. These can participate in a recall response upon reexposure to antigen even at protracted times postinfection. Here, antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) was found to prolong survival upon T cell stimulation, and mice expressing human MCL1 as a transgene exhibited a skewing in the proportion of CD8(+) T cells, away from SLECs toward MPECs, during the acute phase of vaccinia virus infection. A higher frequency and total number of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells were observed in MCL1 transgenic mice. These findings show that MCL1 can shape the makeup of the CD8(+) T cell response, promoting the formation of long-term memory. IMPORTANCE: During an immune response to a virus, CD8(+) T cells kill cells infected by the virus, and most die when the infection resolves. However, a small proportion of cells survives and differentiates into long-lived memory cells that confer protection from reinfection by the same virus. This report shows that transgenic expression of an MCL1 protein enhances survival of memory CD8(+) T cells following infection with vaccinia virus. This is important because it shows that MCL1 expression may be an important determinant of the formation of long-term CD8(+) T cell memory.","['Gui, Jingang', 'Hu, Zhuting', 'Tsai, Ching-Yi', 'Ma, Tian', 'Song, Yan', 'Morales, Amanda', 'Huang, Li-Hao', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan', 'Craig, Ruth W', 'Usherwood, Edward J']","['Gui J', 'Hu Z', 'Tsai CY', 'Ma T', 'Song Y', 'Morales A', 'Huang LH', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Craig RW', 'Usherwood EJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA edward.j.usherwood@dartmouth.edu ruth.w.craig@dartmouth.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA edward.j.usherwood@dartmouth.edu ruth.w.craig@dartmouth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141210,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC4338882,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/04/09 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02480-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02480-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Feb;89(4):2405-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02480-14.

Host intrinsic restriction factors, such as APOBEC3 (A3) proteins, are constitutively expressed and dedicated to interfering with the replication cycle of retroviruses. To survive, propagate, and persist, retroviruses must counteract these restriction factors, often by way of virus genome-encoded accessory proteins. Glycosylated Gag, also called glycosylated Pr80 Gag (gPr80), is a gammaretrovirus genome-encoded protein that inhibits the antiretroviral activity of mouse A3 (mA3). Here we show that gPr80 exerts two distinct inhibitory effects on mA3: one that antagonizes deamination-independent restriction and another one that inhibits its deaminase activity. More specifically, we find that the number of N-glycosylated residues in gPr80 inversely correlates with the sensitivity of a gammaretrovirus to deamination by mouse A3 and also, surprisingly, by human A3G. Finally, our work highlights that retroviruses which have successfully integrated into the mouse germ line generally express a gPr80 with fewer glycosylated sites than exogenous retroviruses. This observation supports the suggestion that modulation of A3 deamination intensity could be a desirable attribute for retroviruses to increase genetic diversification and avoid immune detection. Overall, we present here the first description of how gammaretroviruses employ posttranslational modification to antagonize and modulate the activity of a host genome-encoded retroviral restriction factor. IMPORTANCE: APOBEC3 proteins are host factors that have a major role in protecting humans and other mammals against retroviruses. These enzymes hinder their replication and intensely mutate their DNA, thereby inactivating viral progeny and the spread of infection. Here we describe a newly recognized way in which some retroviruses protect themselves against the mutator activity of APOBEC3 proteins. We show that gammaretroviruses expressing an accessory protein called glycosylated Gag, or gPr80, use the host's posttranslational machinery and, more specifically, N-linked glycosylation as a way to modulate their sensitivity to mutations by APOBEC3 proteins. By carefully controlling the amount of mutations caused by APOBEC3 proteins, gammaretroviruses can find a balance that helps them evolve and persist.","['Rosales Gerpe, Maria Carla', 'Renner, Tyler Milston', 'Belanger, Kasandra', 'Lam, Cindy', 'Aydin, Halil', 'Langlois, Marc-Andre']","['Rosales Gerpe MC', 'Renner TM', 'Belanger K', 'Lam C', 'Aydin H', 'Langlois MA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada langlois@uottawa.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC4338886,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/04/09 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03330-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03330-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Feb;89(4):2342-57. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03330-14.

The purpose of this study was to assess the preclinical efficacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor AZD1480, both as a single agent and in combination with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib, against JAK-mutated patient-derived xenografts. Patient-derived xenografts were established in immunodeficient mice from bone marrow or peripheral blood biopsy specimens, and their gene expression profiles compared with the original patient biopsies by microarray analysis. JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways, and the inhibitory effects of targeted drugs, were interrogated by immunoblotting of phosphoproteins. The antileukemic effects of AZD1480 and selumetinib, alone and in combination, were tested against JAK-mutated ALL xenografts both in vitro and in vivo. Xenografts accurately represented the primary disease as determined by gene expression profiling. Cellular phosphoprotein analysis demonstrated that JAK-mutated xenografts exhibited heightened activation status of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways compared with typical B-cell precursor ALL xenografts, which were inhibited by AZD1480 exposure. However, AZD1480 exhibited modest single-agent in vivo efficacy against JAK-mutated xenografts. Combining AZD1480 with selumetinib resulted in profound synergistic in vitro cell killing, although these results were not translated in vivo despite evidence of target inhibition. Despite validation of target inhibition and the demonstration of profound in vitro synergy between AZD1480 and selumetinib, it is likely that prolonged target inhibition is required to achieve in vivo therapeutic enhancement between JAK and MEK inhibitors in the treatment of JAK-mutated ALL.","['Suryani, Santi', 'Bracken, Lauryn S', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Sia, Keith C S', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'Dietrich, Philipp A', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Suryani S', 'Bracken LS', 'Harvey RC', 'Sia KC', 'Carol H', 'Chen IM', 'Evans K', 'Dietrich PA', 'Roberts KG', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Billups CA', 'Mullighan CG', 'Willman CL', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", 'Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", 'Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', ""University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'CTEP/NCI, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. rlock@ccia.unsw.edu.au.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,PMC4326541,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-14-0647 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0647 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2015 Feb;14(2):364-74. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0647.

The aims of this study were to assess the usage rate of family UCB collections directed to patients with acute leukemia and to investigate the factors influencing the usage rate. A total of 113 families were enrolled, 118 UCB units were successfully collected and one collection failed due to emergency occurred during delivery.

During this time interval, considering only patients who have had the need of a transplant, the main factor influencing low utilization rate of UCB collections was due to HLA disparity, indeed among typed UCB unit mostly (77 %) resulted HLA mismatched with the intended recipient.","['Screnci, M', 'Murgi, E', 'Tamburini, A', 'Pecci, M R', 'Ballatore, G', 'Cusanno, A', 'Valle, V', 'Luciani, P', 'Corona, F', 'Girelli, G']","['Screnci M', 'Murgi E', 'Tamburini A', 'Pecci MR', 'Ballatore G', 'Cusanno A', 'Valle V', 'Luciani P', 'Corona F', 'Girelli G']","['Department of Immunoematologia e Medicina Trasfusionale, Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Via Chieti N degrees 7, 00161, Rome, Italy, mscrenci@alice.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12015-014-9579-z [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2015 Apr;11(2):275-9. doi: 10.1007/s12015-014-9579-z.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Banks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Pregnancy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, a unifying hypothesis underpinning these pathological events remains unknown. Given that SSc is a multifactorial disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors, we focus on the two transcription factors, which modulate the fibrotic reaction and are epigenetically suppressed in SSc dermal fibroblasts, Friend leukaemia integration 1 (Fli1) and Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5). In addition to the Fli1 silencing-dependent collagen induction, the simultaneous knockdown of Fli1 and KLF5 synergistically enhances expression of connective tissue growth factor. Notably, mice with double heterozygous deficiency of Klf5 and Fli1 mimicking the epigenetic phenotype of SSc skin spontaneously recapitulate all the three features of SSc, including fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and lung, B-cell activation and autoantibody production. These studies implicate the epigenetic downregulation of Fli1 and KLF5 as a central event triggering the pathogenic triad of SSc.","['Noda, Shinji', 'Asano, Yoshihide', 'Nishimura, Satoshi',

Primary engraftment failed in five patients, all of whom had received allografts from HLA-mismatched donors. HLA-mismatched HSCT resulted in poorer event-free survival than HLA-matched HSCT (28.8 vs. 70.6 %). Three patients died of transplantation-related causes, and eight patients experienced hematological relapse (including five patients who died due to disease progression). Eight patients received a second HSCT, and four of these patients have survived.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the production of PpIXbased on the administration of ALA and MAL and the effect of ALA-PDTat cellular level on non-infected and infected THP-1 cells using Leishmania ( Viannia ) panamensis or Leishmania ( Leishmania ) infantum (syn Leishmania chagasi ) parasites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production and mitochondrial colocalization were evaluated by confocal microscopy. Cell toxicities were evaluated after treatment with the compounds, followed by light irradiation (597-752 nm) at 2.5 J/cm 2 fluency using a colorimetric MTT assay for THP-1 cells and a standard microscopic analysis of parasites. RESULTS were expressed as compound concentration activity against 50% of cells or parasites (CC 50 or IC 50 ). RESULTS: ALA or MAL induced an endogenous PpIX with a red fluorescence localized mainly in the mitochondria inside human cells. ALA and MAL-PDT induced a similar range of toxicities on THP-1 cells (CC 50 0.16 +/- 0.01 mM and 0.33 +/- 0.019 mM, respectively) without any apparent inhibition of intracellular parasites in the infected cells as compared to untreated controls. Exogenous PpIX-PDT was toxic to THP-1 cells (CC 50 0.00032 +/- 0.00002 mM), L. (L.) infantum (IC 50 0.003 +/- 0.0001 mM) and L. (V.) panamensis (IC 50 0.024 +/- 0.0001 mM) promastigotes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the effectiveness of exogenous PpIX on promastigotes and the production of PpIX by human infected cells, treatment with ALA or MAL before irradiation was unable to completely destroy L. (L.) infantum or L. (V.) panamensis intracellular amastigotes.","['Mateus, Jairo E', 'Valdivieso, Wilfredo', 'Hernandez, Indira P', 'Martinez, Fernando', 'Paez, Edgar', 'Escobar, Patricia']","['Mateus JE', 'Valdivieso W', 'Hernandez IP', 'Martinez F', 'Paez E', 'Escobar P']","['Centro de Investigacion de Enfermedades Tropicales (CINTROP), Escuela de Medicina, Departamento de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigacion de Enfermedades Tropicales (CINTROP), Escuela de Medicina, Departamento de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigacion de Enfermedades Tropicales (CINTROP), Escuela de Medicina, Departamento de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigacion en Catalisis (CICAT), Escuela de Quimica, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigacion en Catalisis (CICAT), Escuela de Quimica, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.', 'Centro de Investigacion de Enfermedades Tropicales (CINTROP), Escuela de Medicina, Departamento de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0120-41572014000400012 [pii]', '10.1590/S0120-41572014000400012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomedica. 2014 Oct-Dec;34(4):589-97. doi: 10.1590/S0120-41572014000400012.,,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Amphotericin B/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorimetry', 'Humans', 'Leishmania guyanensis/*drug effects', 'Leishmania infantum/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lysosomes/chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/chemistry', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/parasitology/ultrastructure', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Protoporphyrins/*analysis', 'Species Specificity', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry/*drug effects']","['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '585NM85KYM (methyl 5-aminolevulinate)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter two diseases have preleukemic features and frequently evolve to AML. As with solid tumors, multiple mutations are required for leukemogenesis. A decade ago, these gene alterations were subdivided into two categories: class I mutations stimulating cell growth or inhibiting apoptosis; and class II mutations that hamper differentiation of hematopoietic cells. In mouse models, class I mutations such as the Bcr-Abl fusion kinase induce MPN by themselves and some class II mutations such as Runx1 mutations induce MDS. Combinations of class I and class II mutations induce AML in a variety of mouse models. Thus, it was postulated that hematopoietic cells whose differentiation is blocked by class II mutations would autonomously proliferate with class I mutations leading to the development of leukemia. Recent progress in high-speed sequencing has enabled efficient identification of novel mutations in a variety of molecules including epigenetic factors, splicing factors, signaling molecules and proteins in the cohesin complex; most of these are not categorized as either class I or class II mutations. The functional consequences of these mutations are now being extensively investigated. In this article, we will review the molecular basis of hematological malignancies, focusing on mouse models and the interfaces between these models and clinical findings, and revisit the classical class I/II hypothesis.","['Kitamura, Toshio', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Okochi-Watanabe, Naoko', 'Kato, Naoko', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Lu, Yang', 'Enomoto, Yutaka', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Uchida, Tomoyuki', 'Kagiyama, Yuki', 'Togami, Katsuhiro', 'Kawabata, Kimihito C', 'Nagase, Reina', 'Horikawa, Sayuri', 'Hayashi, Yasutaka', 'Saika, Makoto', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Izawa, Kumi', 'Oki, Toshihiko', 'Nakahara, Fumio', 'Kitaura, Jiro']","['Kitamura T', 'Inoue D', 'Okochi-Watanabe N', 'Kato N', 'Komeno Y', 'Lu Y', 'Enomoto Y', 'Doki N', 'Uchida T', 'Kagiyama Y', 'Togami K', 'Kawabata KC', 'Nagase R', 'Horikawa S', 'Hayashi Y', 'Saika M', 'Fukuyama T', 'Izawa K', 'Oki T', 'Nakahara F', 'Kitaura J']","['Division of Cellular Therapy/Division of Stem Cell Signaling, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Japan,Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Japan Academy.

In this study, we evaluated the homogeneity of correlation structures within and between datasets of six etiological disease categories; inflammatory, immune, infectious, degenerative, hereditary and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also assessed the effect of filtering; detection call and variance filtering on correlation structures. We downloaded microarray datasets from ArrayExpress for experiments meeting predefined criteria and ended up with 12 datasets for non-cancerous diseases and six for AML. The datasets were preprocessed by a common procedure incorporating platform-specific recommendations and the two filtering methods mentioned above. Homogeneity of correlation matrices between and within datasets of etiological diseases was assessed using the Box's M statistic on permuted samples. We found that correlation structures significantly differ between datasets of the same and/or different etiological disease categories and that variance filtering eliminates more uncorrelated probesets than detection call filtering and thus renders the data highly correlated.","['Jong, Victor L', 'Novianti, Putri W', 'Roes, Kit C B', 'Eijkemans, Marinus J C']","['Jong VL', 'Novianti PW', 'Roes KC', 'Eijkemans MJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,101176023,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/sagmb-2014-0003 [doi]', '/j/sagmb.2014.13.issue-6/sagmb-2014-0003/sagmb-2014-0003.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol. 2014 Dec;13(6):717-32. doi: 10.1515/sagmb-2014-0003.,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Datasets as Topic', '*Gene Expression', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', '*Models, Statistical']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 114 AML patients who received allo-HCT were retrospectively analyzed.

MK was found in 12 patients among 23 with adverse cytogenetic risk. Pretransplant disease status was active disease in 5 cases (45.5%) in the adverse-risk without MK group, and 8 cases (66.7%) in the corresponding group with MK, 15 (19.2%) in the intermediate group and 4 (30.8%) in the favorable group. In multivariate analysis, active disease before transplant (hazard ratio, HR 3.913, p < 0.001), acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) >/=grade 2 (HR 1.908, p = 0.048) and chronic GVHD (HR 0.364, p = 0.001) affected overall survival (OS). The initial cytogenetic risk groups were not a significant risk factor for OS in allogeneic settings. The 2-year OS rate was 44.0 +/- 15.9% without MK and 20.7 +/- 17.9% with MK (p = 0.246). However, the OS rate was better for patients with chronic GVHD (p = 0.025). In conclusion, a survival benefit was observed for MK-positive patients with chronic GVHD in an allogeneic setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiments were performed on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells and human acute myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells. The study was conducted using flow cytometry and light microscopy methods. RESULTS: The various patterns of temporary changes in the cell cycle and DNA fragmentation, as well as the extent of mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis, and necrosis, were determined. The anti-leukemic activities of the new daunorubicin analogs were weaker than that of daunorubicin. CONCLUSION: The influence of these anthracyclines on cell-cycle progression, DNA damage, and induction of mitotic catastrophe and cell death depended on the agent and its concentration, the time interval after application, and the cell line used.

In the present study, the cytotoxic effects of TCNAs doxycycline (DOXY), minocycline (MINO) and chemically modified tetracycline-3 (COL-3) were investigated in the human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line. Cells were incubated with TCNAs in final concentrations of 0.5-100 microg/ml for 24 h. Viability of the leukemic cells was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner using resazurin assay. The estimated IC50s were 9.2 microg/ml for DOXY, 9.9 microg/ml for MINO and 1.3 microg/ml for COL-3. All three TCNAs induced potent cytotoxic effects and cell death. Apoptosis, which was assessed by morphological changes and annexin V positivity, was concentration- and time-dependent following incubation with any one of the drugs. TCNAs induced DNA double strand breaks soon after treatment commenced as detected by gammaH2AX and western blot. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), caspase activation and cleavage of PARP and Bcl-2 were observed; however, the sequence of events differed among the drugs. Pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK improved survival of TCNAs-treated cells and decreased TCNAs-induced apoptosis. In summary, we demonstrated that TCNAs had a cytotoxic effect on the HL-60 leukemic cell line. Apoptosis was induced via mitochondria-mediated and caspase-dependent pathways in HL-60 cells by all three TCNAs. COL-3 exerted the strongest anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in concentrations that have been achieved in human plasma in reported clinical trials. These results indicate that there is a therapeutic potential of TCNAs in leukemia.","['Song, Hairong', 'Fares, Mona', 'Maguire, Kim R', 'Siden, Ake', 'Potacova, Zuzana']","['Song H', 'Fares M', 'Maguire KR', 'Siden A', 'Potacova Z']","['Experimental Cancer Medicine, Clinical Research Center Novum, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Experimental Cancer Medicine, Clinical Research Center Novum, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Experimental Cancer Medicine, Clinical Research Center Novum, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm Sweden.', 'Experimental Cancer Medicine, Clinical Research Center Novum, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141215,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4266609,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0114457 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-32380 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 15;9(12):e114457. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0114457. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Doxycycline/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Minocycline/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Tetracyclines/*pharmacology']","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tetracyclines)', '0 (tetracycline CMT-3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Each field within pediatric cancer has rapidly and comprehensively begun to define genomic targets in tumors that potentially can improve the clinical outcome of patients, including hematologic malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma), solid malignancies (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma), and brain tumors (gliomas, ependymomas, and medulloblastomas). Although each tumor has specific and sometimes overlapping genomic targets, the translation to the clinic of new targeted trials and precision medicine protocols is still in its infancy. The first clinical tumor profiling studies in pediatric oncology have demonstrated feasibility and patient enthusiasm for the personalized medicine paradigm, but have yet to demonstrate clinical utility. Complexities influencing implementation include rapidly evolving sequencing technologies, tumor heterogeneity, and lack of access to targeted therapies. The return of incidental findings from the germline also remains a challenge, with evolving policy statements and accepted standards. SUMMARY: The translation of genomic discoveries to the clinic in pediatric oncology continues to move forward at a brisk pace. Early adoption of genomics for tumor classification, risk stratification, and initial trials of targeted therapeutic agents has led to powerful results. As our experience grows in the integration of genomic and clinical medicine, the outcome for children with cancer should continue to improve.","['Glade Bender, Julia', 'Verma, Anupam', 'Schiffman, Joshua D']","['Glade Bender J', 'Verma A', 'Schiffman JD']","['aDivision of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York bDivision of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/09/25 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000172 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2015 Feb;27(1):34-43. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000172.,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Infant', 'Medical Oncology/*trends', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*trends', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Precision Medicine/*trends', '*Translational Research, Biomedical/methods/trends']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: T-lineage ALL has considerable phenotypic and biological heterogeneity. Compared with B-lineage ALL, the prognostic significance of the presenting white cell count is weaker and the rate of decline in minimal residual disease is slower in patients with T-lineage ALL. Contemporary, response stratified, treatment protocols incorporating dexamethasone have been associated with significant improvements in outcomes and demonstrated that cranial radiotherapy is not essential for preventing central nervous system relapse. Relapse risk remains higher than for B-lineage ALL and outcome after relapse is poor. Early T-precursor phenotype and genetic abnormalities such as activating ABL1 fusions, NOTCH1/FBXW7, and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene mutations identify patient groups who may benefit from alternative treatment. New agents such as nelarabine, bortezomib, and clofarabine may be effective in preventing unsalvageable relapses identified by slow response to first-line therapy. SUMMARY: Around 85% of children and young people with T-lineage ALL are cured by current therapy. Further improvements in outcome can be expected from genetic profile and response-targeted therapeutics.","['Patrick, Katharine', 'Vora, Ajay']","['Patrick K', 'Vora A']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/09/25 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000171 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2015 Feb;27(1):44-9. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000171.,,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Age Factors', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']","['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal aberrations were observed by CA in 6% of the cases in unstimulated cultures, in 27% of the cases with PWM, and in 40% of the cases with DSP30/IL2. Some clonal aberrations were detected by CA only with one culture method. Using 3 different culture methods, clonal aberrations were detected in 41% of the cases by CA and in 71% of the cases by FISH. Altogether, 78% of the cases exhibited clonal aberrations discovered by CA and FISH. Also, CA detected clonal aberrations not targeted by FISH in 7% of the cases, and FISH identified clonal aberrations not detected by CA in 36% of the cases.

Many laboratories in Japan have developed different HTLV-1 qPCR methods. However, when six independent laboratories analyzed the proviral load of the same samples, there was a 5-fold difference in their results. To standardize HTLV-1 qPCR, preparation of a well-defined reference material is needed. We analyzed the integrated HTLV-1 genome and the internal control (IC) genes of TL-Om1, a cell line derived from adult T-cell leukemia, to confirm its suitability as a reference material for HTLV-1 qPCR. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that HTLV-1 provirus was monoclonally integrated in chromosome 1 at the site of 1p13 in the TL-Om1 genome. HTLV-1 proviral genome was not transferred from TL-Om1 to an uninfected T-cell line, suggesting that the HTLV-1 proviral copy number in TL-Om1 cells is stable. To determine the copy number of HTLV-1 provirus and IC genes in TL-Om1 cells, we used FISH, digital PCR, and qPCR. HTLV-1 copy numbers obtained by these three methods were similar, suggesting that their results were accurate. Also, the ratio of the copy number of HTLV-1 provirus to one of the IC genes, RNase P, was consistent for all three methods. These findings indicate that TL-Om1 cells are an appropriate reference material for HTLV-1 qPCR.","['Kuramitsu, Madoka', 'Okuma, Kazu', 'Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Yamochi, Tadanori', 'Firouzi, Sanaz', 'Momose, Haruka', 'Mizukami, Takuo', 'Takizawa, Kazuya', 'Araki, Kumiko', 'Sugamura, Kazuo', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Hamaguchi, Isao']","['Kuramitsu M', 'Okuma K', 'Yamagishi M', 'Yamochi T', 'Firouzi S', 'Momose H', 'Mizukami T', 'Takizawa K', 'Araki K', 'Sugamura K', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Watanabe T', 'Hamaguchi I']","['Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Miyagi Cancer Center Research Institute, Natori, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan 130hama@niid.go.jp.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,PMC4298509,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCM.02254-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.02254-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2015 Feb;53(2):587-96. doi: 10.1128/JCM.02254-14.

During hematopoiesis, specific expression signatures have been reported in different blood cell lineages and stages of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation. Here we explored the expression of miRNAs in umbilical cord blood stem (HSC) and progenitor cells (HPC) and compared it to unilineage granulocyte and granulo-monocyte differentiation as well as to primary blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CD34 + CD38- ad CD34 + CD38 + cells were profiled using a global array consisting of about 2000 miRNAs. An approach combining bioinformatic prediction of miRNA targets with mRNA expression profiling was used to search for putative biologically enriched functions and networks. At least 15 miRNAs to be differentially expressed between HSC and HPC cell population, a cluster of 7 miRNAs are located in the q32 region of human chromosome 14 (miR-377-3p, -136-5p, 376a-3p, 495-3p, 654-3p, 376c-3p and 381-3p) whose expression decreased during the early stages of normal myelopoiesis but were markedly increased in a small set of AML. Interestingly, miR-4739 and -4516, two novel microRNA whose function and targets are presently unknown, showed specific and peculiar expression profile during the hematopoietic stem cells differentiation into unilineages and resulted strongly upregulated in almost all AML subsets. miR-181, -126-5p, -29b-3p and -22-3p resulted dis-regulated in specific leukemias phenotypes. This study provides the first evidence of a miRNA signature in human cord blood stem and progenitor cells with a potential role in hematopoietic stemness properties and possibly in leukemogenesis of specific AML subtypes.","['Cattaneo, M', 'Pelosi, E', 'Castelli, G', 'Cerio, A M', ""D'Angio, A"", 'Porretti, L', 'Rebulla, P', 'Pavesi, L', 'Russo, G', 'Giordano, A', 'Turri, J', 'Cicconi, L', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Testa, U', 'Biunno, Ida']","['Cattaneo M', 'Pelosi E', 'Castelli G', 'Cerio AM', ""D'Angio A"", 'Porretti L', 'Rebulla P', 'Pavesi L', 'Russo G', 'Giordano A', 'Turri J', 'Cicconi L', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Testa U', 'Biunno I']","['Institute for Genetic and Biomedical Research, National Council of Research, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/07/16 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24876 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2015 Aug;230(8):1770-80. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24876.,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies it is critical to be able to monitor and/or sort the infected cells, typically via fluorescent proteins encoded by the modified viral genome. The most popular strategy to ensure co-expression of transgene and reporter gene is to insert between these cDNAs an IRES element, thus generating bi-cistronic mRNAs whose transcription is driven by a single promoter. However, while the product of the gene located upstream of the IRES is generally abundantly expressed, the translation of the downstream cDNA (typically encoding the reporter protein) is often inconsistent, which hinders the detection and the isolation of transduced cells. To overcome these limitations, we developed novel lentiviral dual-promoter vectors (named UMG-LV5 and -LV6) where transgene expression is driven by the potent UBC promoter and that of the reporter protein, EGFP, by the minimal regulatory element of the WASP gene. These vectors, harboring two distinct transgenes, were tested in a variety of human haematopoietic cell lines as well as in primary human CD34+ cells in comparison with the FUIGW vector that contains the expression cassette UBC-transgene-IRES-EGFP. In these experiments both UMG-LV5 and UMG-LV6 yielded moderately lower transgene expression than FUIGW, but dramatically higher levels of EGFP, thereby allowing the easy distinction between transduced and non-transduced cells. An additional construct was produced, in which the cDNA encoding the reporter protein is upstream, and the transgene downstream of the IRES sequence. This vector, named UMG-LV11, proved able to promote abundant expression of both transgene product and EGFP in all cells tested. The UMG-LVs represent therefore useful vectors for gene transfer-based studies in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as in non-hematopoietic cells.","['Chiarella, Emanuela', 'Carra,

In the present study, PLK2 was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and three types of gastric cancer cells, SGC7901, MKN45 and BGC823. Transfection of SGC7901 gastric cancer cells with small interfering (si)RNA against PLK2 exerted no effect on the ratio of cells at different stages of the cell cycle compared with that of the untransfected and control siRNAtransfected cells. In addition, silencing of PLK2 significantly enhanced the growth of SGC7901 cells through inhibiting apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosisassociated genes Bax and caspase 3 were found to be downregulated at the protein level.

While clinically effective, DNMT inhibitors are not curative. A combination with cytotoxic drugs might be beneficial, but this is largely unexplored. In the present study, we analyzed potential synergisms between cytotoxic drugs and 5-azacytidine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Lung cancer and leukemia cell lines were exposed to low doses of 5-azacytidine with varying doses of cytarabine or etoposide for AML cells (U937 and HL60) as well as cisplatin or gemcitabine for NSCLC cells (A549 and HTB56) for 48 h. Drug interaction and potential synergism was analyzed according to the Chou-Talalay algorithm. Further analyses were based on soft agar colony formation assays, active caspase-3 staining and BrdU incorporation flow cytometry. To identify effects on DNA methylation patterns, we performed genome wide DNA methylation analysis using 450K bead arrays. Azacytidine at low doses was synergistic with cytotoxic drugs in NSCLC and in AML cell lines. Simultaneous exposure to 5-azacytidine with cytotoxic drugs showed strong synergistic activity. In colony formation assays these synergisms were repeatedly verified for 5-azacytidine (25 nM) with low doses of anticancer agents. 5-azacytidine neither affected the cell cycle nor increased apoptosis. 450K methylation bead arrays revealed 1,046 CpG sites in AML and 1,778 CpG sites in NSCLC cells with significant DNA hypomethylation (24-h exposure) to 5-azacytidine combined with the cytotoxic drugs. These CpG-sites were observed in the candidate tumor-suppressor genes MGMT and THRB. Additional incubation time after 24-h treatment led to a 4.1-fold increase of significant hypomethylated CpG-sites in NSCLC cells. These results suggest that the addition of DNA demethylating agents to cytotoxic anticancer drugs exhibits synergistic activity in AML and NSCLC. Dysregulation of an equilibrium of DNA methylation in cancer cells might increase the susceptibility for cytotoxic drugs.","['Fuller, Mathias', 'Klein, Miriam', 'Schmidt, Eva', 'Rohde, Christian', 'Gollner, Stefanie', 'Schulze, Isabell', 'Qianli, Jiang', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Edemir, Bayram', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Tschanter, Petra']","['Fuller M', 'Klein M', 'Schmidt E', 'Rohde C', 'Gollner S', 'Schulze I', 'Qianli J', 'Berdel WE', 'Edemir B', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Tschanter P']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2792 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 Mar;46(3):1192-204. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2792.

In the mouse, the neutralizing antibody response to Friend murine leukemia virus is contributed by an allelic form of the enzyme Apobec3 (abbreviated A3). This is counterintuitive because A3 directly controls viremia before the onset of adaptive antiviral immune responses. It suggests that A3 also affects the antibody response directly. Here, we studied the relative size of cell populations of the adaptive immune system as a function of A3 activity. We created a transgenic mouse that expresses all seven human A3 enzymes and compared it to WT and mouse A3-deficient mice. A3 enzymes decreased the number of marginal zone B cells, but not the number of follicular B or T cells. When mouse A3 was knocked out, the retroelement hitchhiker-1 and sialyl transferases encoded by genes close to it were overexpressed three and two orders of magnitude, respectively. We suggest that A3 shifts the balance, from the fast antibody response mediated by marginal zone B cells with little affinity maturation, to a more sustained germinal center B-cell response, which drives affinity maturation and, thereby, a better neutralizing response.","['Beck-Engeser, Gabriele B', 'Winkelmann, Rebecca', 'Wheeler, Matthew L', 'Shansab, Maryam', 'Yu, Philipp', 'Wunsche, Sarah', 'Walchhutter, Anja', 'Metzner, Mirjam', 'Vettermann, Christian', 'Eilat, Dan', 'DeFranco, Anthony', 'Jack, Hans-Martin', 'Wabl, Matthias']","['Beck-Engeser GB', 'Winkelmann R', 'Wheeler ML', 'Shansab M', 'Yu P', 'Wunsche S', 'Walchhutter A', 'Metzner M', 'Vettermann C', 'Eilat D', 'DeFranco A', 'Jack HM', 'Wabl M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150121,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,PMC4972502,['NOTNLM'],"['Apobec3', 'B cell', 'Hitchhiker-1', 'Recovery from Friend virus 3 (Rfv3)', 'Sialyl transferases']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201445218 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2015 Mar;45(3):695-704. doi: 10.1002/eji.201445218.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of seven leukemia-associated genes (WT1, PRAME, CCL23, GAGED2, MSLN, SPAG6, and ST18) was measured by TaqMan Low Density Arrays in 112 patients and 52 healthy controls. Patients were treated according to the multicenter study AML-BFM 2004. Samples were collected prospectively at standard time points. The laboratory that measured MRD was blinded to patient outcome. RESULTS: Relapse-free survival (RFS) was 95% (N = 19; SE = 5%) if expression of all genes was down to normal on day 15, 63% (N = 41; SE = 8%) if expression was normalized on day 28, and 38% (N = 21; SE = 11%) in patients who still showed elevated expression on day 28. The prognostic impact of MRD remained significant (P = 0.002) when patients were stratified for the AML-BFM 2004 risk group. Multivariate analysis identified the MRD risk group and day 28 cytology as the only independent prognostic factors. Patients with a cytologic nonremission on day 28, which was confirmed by MRD, had a dismal prognosis. Only 1 out of 8 patients survived without relapse.

Therefore, alternative therapies are required to target both mature CML cells with wild-type (WT) or mutant Bcr-Abl and LSCs. To investigate the effect of C086, a derivative of curcumin, on imatinib-resistant cells, we explored its underlying mechanisms of Bcr-Abl kinase and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) function inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Biochemical assays were used to test ABL kinase activity; fluorescence measurements using recombinant NHsp90, Hsp90 ATPase assay, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were applied to examine Hsp90 function. Colony-forming unit, long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC), and flow cytometry were used to test CML progenitor and stem cells. RESULTS: Biochemical assays with purified recombinant Abl kinase confirmed that C086 can directly inhibit the kinase activity of Abl, including WT and the Q252H, Y253F, and T315I mutations. Furthermore, we identified C086 as a novel Hsp90 inhibitor with the capacity to disrupt the Hsp90 chaperone function in CML cells. Consequently, it inhibited the growth of both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells. Interestingly, C086 has the capacity to inhibit LTC-ICs and to induce apoptosis in both CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in vitro. Moreover, C086 could decrease the number of CD45(+), CD45(+)CD34(+)CD38(+), and CD45(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in CML NOD-SCID mice. CONCLUSIONS: Dual suppression of Abl kinase activity and Hsp90 chaperone function by C086 provides a new therapeutic strategy for treating Bcr-Abl-induced leukemia resistant to TKIs.","['Wu, Lixian', 'Yu, Jing', 'Chen, Ruijia', 'Liu, Yang', 'Lou, Liguang', 'Wu, Ying', 'Huang, Lisen', 'Fan, Yingjuan', 'Gao, Pinzhang', 'Huang, Meijuan', 'Wu, Yong', 'Chen, Yuanzhong', 'Xu, Jianhua']","['Wu L', 'Yu J', 'Chen R', 'Liu Y', 'Lou L', 'Wu Y', 'Huang L', 'Fan Y', 'Gao P', 'Huang M', 'Wu Y', 'Chen Y', 'Xu J']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University (FMU), Fuzhou, P.R.

Here, an open-label phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in 50 Japanese patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML during the chronic phase (CML-CP). Dasatinib was effective in imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant patients. After 12 months of dasatinib therapy, 35 patients (70%) had achieved a major molecular response (MMR) and 16 patients (32%) had achieved a complete molecular response (CMR).

However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are associated with side effects on bone metabolism, in adult and pediatric patients. Vitamin D3 is involved in the complex cycle of bone remodeling, therefore the present study aimed to investigate the influence of imatinib on vitamin D3 metabolism in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line, using commercially available enzyme assays. Imatinib was shown to significantly reduce the production of calcidiol and calcitriol.

The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, encoding a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is thought to be sufficient to cause chronic phase (CP) CML, whereas additional genetic lesions are needed for progression into CML BC. To generate a humanized CML model, we retrovirally expressed BCR-ABL1 in the cord blood CD34(+) cells and transplanted these into NOD-SCID (non-obese diabetic/severe-combined immunodeficient) interleukin-2-receptor gamma-deficient mice. In primary mice, BCR-ABL1 expression induced an inflammatory-like state in the bone marrow and spleen, and mast cells were the only myeloid lineage specifically expanded by BCR-ABL1. Upon secondary transplantation, the pronounced inflammatory phenotype was lost and mainly human mast cells and macrophages were found in the bone marrow. Moreover, a striking block at the pre-B-cell stage was observed in primary mice, resulting in an accumulation of pre-B cells. A similar block in B-cell differentiation could be confirmed in primary cells from CML patients. Hence, this humanized mouse model of CML reveals previously unexplored features of CP CML and should be useful for further studies to understand the disease pathogenesis of CML.","['Askmyr, M', 'Agerstam, H', 'Lilljebjorn, H', 'Hansen, N', 'Karlsson, C', 'von Palffy, S', 'Landberg, N', 'Hogberg, C', 'Lassen, C', 'Rissler, M', 'Richter, J', 'Ehinger, M', 'Jaras, M', 'Fioretos, T']","['Askmyr M', 'Agerstam H', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Hansen N', 'Karlsson C', 'von Palffy S', 'Landberg N', 'Hogberg C', 'Lassen C', 'Rissler M', 'Richter J', 'Ehinger M', 'Jaras M', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University and Department of Hematology and Vascular Disorders, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pathology, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141212,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,PMC4315895,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201489 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2014.89 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 Dec 12;4:e269. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2014.89.,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology']","['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here a series of 18 patients with MCNS occurring among 13,992 new cases of NHL. We analyzed the clinical and pathologic characteristics of this association, along with the response of patients to treatment, to determine if this association relies on a particular disorder. The most frequent NHLs associated with MCNS were Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (33.3%), marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (27.8%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (22.2%). Other lymphoproliferative disorders included multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In 4 patients MCNS occurred before NHL (mean delay, 15 mo), in 10 patients the disorders occurred simultaneously, and in 4 patients MCNS was diagnosed after NHL (mean delay, 25 mo). Circulating monoclonal immunoglobulins were present in 11 patients. A nontumoral interstitial infiltrate was present in renal biopsy specimens from 3 patients without significant renal impairment. Acute kidney injury resulting from tubular lesions or renal hypoperfusion was present in 6 patients. MCNS relapse occurred more frequently in patients treated exclusively by steroid therapy (77.8%) than in those receiving steroids associated with chemotherapy (25%). In conclusion, MCNS occurs preferentially in NHL originating from B cells and requires an aggressive therapeutic approach to reduce the risk of MCNS relapse.","['Kofman, Tomek', 'Zhang, Shao-Yu', 'Copie-Bergman, Christiane', 'Moktefi, Anissa', 'Raimbourg, Quentin', 'Francois, Helene', 'Karras, Alexandre', 'Plaisier, Emmanuelle', 'Painchart, Bernard', 'Favre, Guillaume', 'Bertrand, Dominique', 'Gyan, Emmanuel', 'Souid, Marc', 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Desvaux, Dominique', 'Grimbert, Philippe', 'Haioun, Corinne', 'Lang, Philippe', 'Sahali, Djillali', 'Audard, Vincent']","['Kofman T', 'Zhang SY', 'Copie-Bergman C', 'Moktefi A', 'Raimbourg Q', 'Francois H', 'Karras A', 'Plaisier E', 'Painchart B', 'Favre G', 'Bertrand D', 'Gyan E', 'Souid M', 'Roos-Weil D', 'Desvaux D', 'Grimbert P', 'Haioun C', 'Lang P', 'Sahali D', 'Audard V']","[""Service de Nephrologie et Transplantation, Groupe hospitalier Henri-Mondor/Albert-Chenevier, Centre de reference maladie rare Syndrome Nephrotique Idiopathique, Institut Francilien de recherche en Nephrologie et Transplantation (IFRNT), AP-HP (Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Creteil), Universite Paris Est Creteil, Creteil (TK, DD, PG, PL, DS, VA); Equipe 21, INSERM Unite 955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Creteil (TK, SYZ, AM, DD, PG, PL, DS, VA); Departement de Pathologie, Groupe hospitalier Henri-Mondor/Albert-Chenevier, AP-HP, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Creteil (CCB, AM); Equipe 9, INSERM Unite 955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Creteil (CCB, CH); Service de Nephrologie, Hopital Bichat, AP-HP, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris (QR); Service de Nephrologie, Hopital Kremlin Bicetre, IFRNT, AP-HP, INSERM Unite 1014, Universite Paris Sud, Kremlin Bicetre (HF); Service de Nephrologie, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris (AK); Service de Nephrologie et Dialyse, Hopital Tenon, AP-HP, INSERM Unite 702, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, Paris (EP); Service de Nephrologie et Hemodialyse, Centre Hospitalier de Cambrai (BP); Service de Nephrologie, Hopital Pasteur, Universite Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice (GF); Service de Nephrologie et Transplantation, Hopital Charles Nicolle, Universite de Rouen, Rouen (DB); Service d'Hematologie et Therapie cellulaire, Hopital Bretonneau, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Tours, Universite de Tours Francois Rabelais, Tours (EG); Service de Nephrologie, Centre Hospitalier intercommunal de Poissy Saint Germain en Laye (MS); Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital La Pitie Salpetriere, AP-HP, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris 06, GRC 11 (GRECHY), Paris (DRW); and Unite d'Hemopathies Lymphoides, AP-HP, Groupe hospitalier Henri-Mondor/Albert-Chenevier, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Creteil (CH), France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC4602440,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000000206 [doi]', '00005792-201411040-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2014 Nov;93(24):350-358. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000206.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrosis, Lipoid/*etiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/complications']",,['Medicine (Baltimore). 2014 Nov;93(24):414'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using genetic manipulation of cell death pathways, we found the monocytic suppressor-cell subset, but not the granulocytic subset, requires continuous c-FLIP expression to prevent caspase-8-dependent, RIPK3-independent cell death. Development of the granulocyte subset requires MCL-1-mediated control of the intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway. Monocytic suppressors tolerate the absence of MCL-1 provided cytokines increase expression of the MCL-1-related protein A1. Monocytic suppressors mediate T cell suppression, whereas their granulocytic counterparts lack suppressive function. The loss of the granulocytic subset via conditional MCL-1 deletion did not alter tumor incidence implicating the monocytic compartment as the functionally immunosuppressive subset in vivo.

Ewing sarcoma cells are also sensitive to PARP inhibitors, although the mechanism is not understood. Here, we evaluated the stereo-selective PARP inhibitor, talazoparib (BMN 673), combined with temozolomide or topotecan. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Talazoparib was tested in vitro in combination with temozolomide (0.3-1,000 mumol/L) or topotecan (0.03-100 nmol/L) and in vivo at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg administered twice daily for 5 days combined with temozolomide (30 mg/kg/daily x 5; combination A) or 0.25 mg/kg administered twice daily for 5 days combined with temozolomide (12 mg/kg/daily x 5; combination B). Pharmacodynamic studies were undertaken after 1 or 5 days of treatment. RESULTS: In vitro talazoparib potentiated the toxicity of temozolomide up to 85-fold, with marked potentiation in Ewing sarcoma and leukemia lines (30-50-fold). There was less potentiation for topotecan. In vivo, talazoparib potentiated the toxicity of temozolomide, and combination A and combination B represent the MTDs when combined with low-dose or high-dose talazoparib, respectively. Both combinations demonstrated significant synergism against 5 of 10 Ewing sarcoma xenografts. The combination demonstrated modest activity against most other xenograft models.

The integrase inhibitor raltegravir has been demonstrated to reduce FeLV replication in vitro. The aim of the present study was to investigate raltegravir in vivo for its safety and efficacy to suppress FeLV replication. The safety was tested in three naive specified pathogen-free (SPF) cats during a 15 weeks treatment period (initially 20mg then 40mg orally b.i.d.). No adverse effects were noted. The efficacy was tested in seven persistently FeLV-infected SPF cats attained from 18 cats experimentally exposed to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1. The seven cats were treated during nine weeks (40mg then 80mg b.i.d.). Raltegravir was well tolerated even at the higher dose. A significant decrease in plasma viral RNA loads ( approximately 5x) was found; however, after treatment termination a rebound effect was observed. Only one cat developed anti-FeLV antibodies and viral RNA loads remained decreased after treatment termination. Of note, one of the untreated FeLV-A infected cats developed fatal FeLV-C associated anemia within 5 weeks of FeLV-A infection. Moreover, progressive FeLV infection was associated with significantly lower enFeLV loads prior to infection supporting that FeLV susceptibility may be related to the genetic background of the cat. Overall, our data demonstrate the ability of raltegravir to reduce viral replication also in vivo. However, no complete control of viremia was achieved. Further investigations are needed to find an optimized treatment against FeLV.

The anticancer activity of 17 compounds were evaluated by National Cancer Institute (USA) using a two stage process utilizing 59 different human tumor cell lines representing leukemia, melanoma, cancers of lung, colon, central nervous system (CNS), ovary, kidney, prostate as well as breast. Compound 9c showed broad spectrum potent anticancer activity in nano molar to micro molar range against 56 human tumor cell lines with GI50 less than 10 muM ranging from 0.495 to 5.57 muM, also it is worth mentioning that compound 9c had the marked highest selectivity against the two cell lines T-47D and MDA-MB-468 belonging to breast cancer with GI50 = 0.495 and 0.568 muM respectively, and its effect was further studied on cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in the MDA-MB-468 cell line. Results showed that compound 9c induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and also, showed accumulation of cells in pre-G1 phase which may result from, degradation or fragmentation of the genetic materials indicating a possible role of apoptosis in compound 9c-induced cancer cell death and cytotoxicity and verifying this compound as promising selective anticancer lead.

In vivo, circulating HTLV-1-infected cells express HBZ mRNA in contrast, Tax expression is typically low or undetectable. To elucidate the virus-suppressing potential of CTLs targeting HBZ, we compared the ability of HBZ- and Tax-specific CTLs to lyse naturally-infected cells, by co-incubating HBZ- and Tax-specific CTL clones with primary CD4(+) T cells from HLA-matched HTLV-1-infected donors. We quantified lysis of infected cells, and tested whether specific virus-induced host cell surface molecules determine the susceptibility of infected cells to CTL-mediated lysis. RESULTS: Primary infected cells upregulated HLA-A*02, ICAM-1, Fas and TRAIL-R1/2 in concert with Tax expression, forming efficient targets for both HTLV-1-specific CTLs and CTLs specific for an unrelated virus. We detected expression of HBZ mRNA (spliced isoform) in both Tax-expressing and non-expressing infected cells, and the HBZ26-34 epitope was processed and presented by cells transfected with an HBZ expression plasmid. However, when coincubated with primary cells, a high-avidity HBZ-specific CTL clone killed significantly fewer infected cells than were killed by a Tax-specific CTL clone. Finally, incubation with Tax- or HBZ-specific CTLs resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of cells expressing high levels of HLA-A*02. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1 gene expression in primary CD4(+) T cells non-specifically increases susceptibility to CTL lysis. Despite the presence of HBZ spliced-isoform mRNA, HBZ epitope presentation by primary cells is significantly less efficient than that of Tax.","['Rowan, Aileen G', 'Suemori, Koichiro', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Yasukawa, Masaki', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Rowan AG', 'Suemori K', 'Fujiwara H', 'Yasukawa M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Taylor GP', 'Bangham CR']","['Section of Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, W2 1PG, UK. a.rowan@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Department of Bioregulatory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime University, and Ehime University Proteomedicine Research Center, Toh-on city, Ehime, Japan. suemori@m.ehime-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Bioregulatory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime University, and Ehime University Proteomedicine Research Center, Toh-on city, Ehime, Japan. yunarief@m.ehime-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Bioregulatory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime University, and Ehime University Proteomedicine Research Center, Toh-on city, Ehime, Japan. yasukawa@m.ehime-u.ac.jp.', 'Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. yuetsu@s4.dion.ne.jp.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, W2 1PG, UK. g.p.taylor@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, W2 1PG, UK. c.bangham@ipmerial.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141214,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC4282740,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-014-0116-6 [doi]', 's12977-014-0116-6 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2014 Dec 14;11:116. doi: 10.1186/s12977-014-0116-6.,,IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We subsequently tested these 2 variant-calling pipelines on 20 leukemia samples from our series (19 primary AMLs and 1 secondary AML). By validating many of the predicted somatic variants (variant allele frequencies ranging from 100% to 5%), we observed significantly different calling efficiencies. In particular, despite relatively high specificity, sensitivity was poor in both pipelines resulting in a high rate of false negatives. Our findings raise the possibility that landscapes of AML genomes might be more complex than previously reported and characterized by the presence of hundreds of genes mutated at low variant allele frequency, suggesting that the application of genome sequencing to the clinic requires a careful and critical evaluation. We think that improvements in technology and workflow standardization, through the generation of clear experimental and bioinformatics guidelines, are fundamental to translate the use of next-generation sequencing from research to the clinic and to transform genomic information into better diagnosis and outcomes for the patient.","['Bodini, Margherita', 'Ronchini, Chiara', 'Giaco, Luciano', 'Russo, Anna', 'Melloni, Giorgio E M', 'Luzi, Lucilla', 'Sardella, Domenico', 'Volorio, Sara', 'Hasan, Syed K', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Toffoletti, Eleonora', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cignetti, Alessandro', 'Tarella, Corrado', 'Bernard, Loris', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Riva, Laura']","['Bodini M', 'Ronchini C', 'Giaco L', 'Russo A', 'Melloni GE', 'Luzi L', 'Sardella D', 'Volorio S', 'Hasan SK', 'Ottone T', 'Lavorgna S', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Candoni A', 'Fanin R', 'Toffoletti E', 'Iacobucci I', 'Martinelli G', 'Cignetti A', 'Tarella C', 'Bernard L', 'Pelicci PG', 'Riva L']","['Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy;', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy;', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy; IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy;', 'IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy; Cogentech, Milan, Italy;', 'IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy; Cogentech, Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research & Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, India; Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of ""Rome Tor Vergata,"" Rome, Italy; Laboratorio di Neuro-Oncoematologia, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy;', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of ""Rome Tor Vergata,"" Rome, Italy; Laboratorio di Neuro-Oncoematologia, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy;', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of ""Rome Tor Vergata,"" Rome, Italy; Laboratorio di Neuro-Oncoematologia, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy;', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of ""Rome Tor Vergata,"" Rome, Italy; Laboratorio di Neuro-Oncoematologia, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Udine, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Udine, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Udine, Italy;', 'Institute of Hematology ""Seragnoli,"" Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy;', 'Institute of Hematology ""Seragnoli,"" Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy;', 'University Division of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Mauriziano Hospital and University of Torino, Torino, Italy; and.', 'University Division of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Mauriziano Hospital and University of Torino, Torino, Italy; and.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy; Cogentech, Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy; Dipartimento di Scienze della salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141212,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4304104,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39499-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-576157 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 22;125(4):600-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-576157.

Despite major advances in the treatment of this highly aggressive disease with potent inhibitors of the BCR-ABL kinase such as dasatinib, patients in remission frequently relapse due to persistent minimal residual disease possibly supported, at least in part, by salutary cytokine-driven signaling within the hematopoietic microenvironment. Using a mouse model of Ph+ ALL that accurately mimics the genetics, clinical behavior, and therapeutic response of the human disease, we show that a combination of 2 agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (dasatinib and ruxolitinib, which inhibit BCR-ABL and Janus kinases, respectively), significantly extends survival by targeting parallel signaling pathways. Although the BCR-ABL kinase cancels the cytokine requirement of immature leukemic B cells, dasatinib therapy restores cytokine dependency and sensitizes leukemic cells to ruxolitinib. As predicted, ruxolitinib alone had no significant antileukemic effect in this model, but it prevented relapse when administered with dasatinib. The combination of dasatinib, ruxolitinib, and the corticosteroid dexamethasone yielded more durable remissions, in some cases after completion of therapy, avoiding the potential toxicity of other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.","['Appelmann, Iris', 'Rillahan, Cory D', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Carbonetti, Gregory', 'Chen, Chong', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Sherr, Charles J']","['Appelmann I', 'Rillahan CD', 'de Stanchina E', 'Carbonetti G', 'Chen C', 'Lowe SW', 'Sherr CJ']","['Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, and.', 'Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, and.', 'Antitumor Assessment Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Antitumor Assessment Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, and.', 'Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and.', ""Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141212,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4342356,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35225-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-601062 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 26;125(9):1444-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-601062.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with APL given one cycle of ATO-based consolidation chemotherapy. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival, event-free survival, and leukemia-free survival was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82%-97%), 89% (95% CI, 77%-95%), and 92% (95% CI, 80%-97%), respectively.

PD-L1 plays an important role in immune responses, however, presently its transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of PD-L1 and miR-34a in 44 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, and observed an inverse correlation between PD-L1 and miR-34a expression. Overexpression of miR-34a in HL-60 and Kasumi-1 cells blocked PD-L1 expression, and reduced PD-L1 surface expression. Using luciferase reporter assay and mutagenesis, we identified miR-34a as a putative binder of the PD-L1-3'UTR. Surface expression of PD-L1 induced by chemotherapeutic agents could also be reversed by miR-34a; furthermore, PD-L1 specific T cell apoptosis was reduced as well following miR-34a transfection. We also found that there is a positive feedback between PD-L1 expression and AKT activation. Our data suggest that miR-34a can regulate PD-L1 expression by targeting PD-L1 mRNA, and our present findings shed new light on the complex regulation of PD-L1 in human tumors, and on miR-34a in cancer immuno-based therapy.","['Wang, Xi', 'Li, Jinge', 'Dong, Ke', 'Lin, Fang', 'Long, Min', 'Ouyang, Yongri', 'Wei, Junxia', 'Chen, Xi', 'Weng, Yuanyuan', 'He, Ting', 'Zhang, Huizhong']","['Wang X', 'Li J', 'Dong K', 'Lin F', 'Long M', 'Ouyang Y', 'Wei J', 'Chen X', 'Weng Y', 'He T', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China."", ""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, PR China.

In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, Lmo2 is part of a protein complex comprised of class II basic helix loop helix proteins, Tal1and Lyl1. The latter transcription factors heterodimerize with E2A proteins like E47 and Heb to bind E boxes. LMO2 and TAL1 or LYL1 cooperate to induce T-ALL in mouse models, and are concordantly expressed in human T-ALL. Furthermore, LMO2 cooperates with the loss of E2A suggesting that LMO2 functions by creating a deficiency of E2A. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in Lmo2-induced T-ALL cell lines. We transduced these lines with an E47/estrogen receptor fusion construct that could be forced to homodimerize with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. We discovered that forced homodimerization induced growth arrest in 2 of the 4 lines tested. The lines sensitive to E47 homodimerization accumulated in G1 and had reduced S phase entry. We analyzed the transcriptome of a resistant and a sensitive line to discern the E47 targets responsible for the cellular effects. Our results suggest that E47 has diverse effects in T-ALL but that functional deficiency of E47 is not a universal feature of Lmo2-induced T-ALL.","['Goodings, Charnise', 'Tripathi, Rati', 'Cleveland, Susan M', 'Elliott, Natalina', 'Guo, Yan', 'Shyr, Yu', 'Dave, Utpal P']","['Goodings C', 'Tripathi R', 'Cleveland SM', 'Elliott N', 'Guo Y', 'Shyr Y', 'Dave UP']","['Departments of Cancer Biology and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Departments of Cancer Biology and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Departments of Cancer Biology and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Departments of Cancer Biology and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Departments of Cancer Biology and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein that is associated with failure to treatment is up-regulated in CLL lymphocytes after interaction with microenvironment. However, the regulation of its expression in context to microenvironment is unclear. We evaluated and compared changes in Mcl-1 in CLL B-cells in suspension culture and when co-cultured on stromal cells. The blockade of apoptosis in co-cultured CLL cells is associated with diminution in caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and is not dependent on cytogenetic profile or prognostic factors of the disease. Stroma-derived resistance to apoptosis is associated with a cascade of transcriptional events such as increase in levels of total RNA Pol II and its phosphorylation at Ser2 and Ser5, increase in the rate of global RNA synthesis, and amplification of Mcl-1 transcript levels. The latter is associated with increase in Mcl-1 protein level without an impact on the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Post-translational modifications of protein kinases show increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, Erk at Thr202/Tyr204 and Gsk-3beta at Ser9 and augmentation of total Mcl-1 accumulation along with phosphorylation at Ser159/Thr163 sites. Collectively, stroma-induced apoptosis resistance is mediated through signaling proteins that regulate transcriptional and translational expression and post-translational modification of Mcl-1 in CLL cells in context to bone marrow stromal microenvironment.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Fu, Min', 'Doifode, Tejaswini', 'Wierda, William G', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Burger JA', 'Fu M', 'Doifode T', 'Wierda WG', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Here, we show a direct relationship between Notch3 receptor and Jagged1 ligand in human cell lines and in a mouse model of T-ALL. We provide evidence that Notch-specific ligand Jagged1 is a new Notch3 signaling target gene. This essential event justifies an aberrant Notch3/Jagged1 cis-expression inside the same cell. Moreover, we demonstrate in Notch3-IC-overexpressing T lymphoma cells that Jagged1 undergoes a raft-associated constitutive processing. The proteolytic cleavage allows the Jagged1 intracellular domain to empower Notch signaling activity and to increase the transcriptional activation of Jagged1 itself (autocrine effect). On the other hand, the release of the soluble Jagged1 extracellular domain has a positive impact on activating Notch signaling in adjacent cells (paracrine effect), finally giving rise to a Notch3/Jagged1 auto-sustaining loop that supports the survival, proliferation, and invasion of lymphoma cells and contributes to the development and progression of Notch-dependent T-ALL. These observations are also supported by a study conducted on a cohort of patients in which Jagged1 expression is associated to adverse prognosis.","['Pelullo, Maria', 'Quaranta, Roberta', 'Talora, Claudio', 'Checquolo, Saula', 'Cialfi, Samantha', 'Felli, Maria Pia', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Borga, Chiara', 'Besharat, Zein Mersini', 'Palermo, Rocco', 'Di Marcotullio, Lucia', 'Capobianco, Anthony J', 'Gulino, Alberto', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Bellavia, Diana']","['Pelullo M', 'Quaranta R', 'Talora C', 'Checquolo S', 'Cialfi S', 'Felli MP', 'te Kronnie G', 'Borga C', 'Besharat ZM', 'Palermo R', 'Di Marcotullio L', 'Capobianco AJ', 'Gulino A', 'Screpanti I', 'Bellavia D']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University, Latina, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Molecular Oncology Program, DeWitt Daughtry Family, Department of Surgery; Miami, FL, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy; Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy; Neuromed Institute, Pozzilli, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy; Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy; Institute Pasteur-Foundation Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.

The major clinical features of MDS are ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, and an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemias, which in turn is most likely determined by specific genetic abnormalities and other presenting hematologic features. The risk of developing MDS is relatively higher in some genetic syndromes such as Fanconi anemia and receipt of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. In recent years a significant progress has occurred and a vast literatures has become available including the spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations relating to RNA splicing machinery, epigenetic regulation of gene expression and signaling pathways associated with MDS pathogenesis, which have provided opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms as well as employ targeted therapeutic approaches to treat MDS. The cytogenetic abnormalities detected in MDS varies from a single abnormality to complex karyotype not easily amenable to conventional cytogenetic analysis. In such cases, array based high resolution genomic analysis detected abnormalities, which are diagnostic as well as prognostic. The most common driver gene mutations detected in patients with MDS include RNA splicing (SF3B1,SRSF2,U2F1,ZRSR2), DNA methylation (TET2,DNMT3A,IDH1/IDH2), chromatin modification (ASXL1,EZH2), transcription regulation (RUNX1,BCOR) and DNA repair control p53. A small subset of MDS arise due to deregulation of RAS pathway, mainly due to NRAS/KRAS/NF1 mutations. Identification of these mutations and pathways have provided opportunities for oncologists to target these patients with specific therapies. Several drugs which either target the spliceosome, oncogenic RAS signaling, or hypomethylating agents have been employed to successfully treat MDS patients.","['Jhanwar, Suresh C']",['Jhanwar SC'],"['Departments of Pathology and Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.

At the same time, there is considerable overlap among these disorders at the molecular level. The various combinations of genetic abnormalities indicate a multi-step pathogenesis, which likely contributes to the marked clinical heterogeneity of these disorders. This review focuses on the current knowledge and challenges related to the molecular pathogenesis of chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and relationships between molecular findings, clinical features and prognosis.","['Li, Bing', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Xiao, Zhijian']","['Li B', 'Gale RP', 'Xiao Z']","['MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, China. zjxiao@medmail.com.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141212,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC4266232,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0093-1 [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0093-1 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Dec 12;7:93. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0093-1.,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Molecular Biology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism through which ELF-EMFs can influence cellular behavior is still unclear. A hypothesis is that ELF-EMFs could interfere with chemical reactions involving free radical production. Under physiologic conditions, cells maintain redox balance through production of ROS/RNS and antioxidant molecules. The altered balance between ROS generation and elimination plays a critical role in a variety of pathologic conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, aging and cancer. Actually, there is a disagreement as to whether there is a causal or coincidental relationship between ELF-EMF exposure and leukemia development. Increased ROS levels have been observed in several hematopoietic malignancies including acute and chronic myeloid leukemias. MAIN METHODS: In our study, the effect of ELF-EMF exposure on catalase, cytochrome P450 and inducible nitric oxide synthase activity and their expression by Western blot analysis in myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 was evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: A significant modulation of iNOS, CAT and Cyt P450 protein expression was recorded as a result of ELF-EMF exposure in both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated and non-stimulated cell lines. Modulation in kinetic parameters of CAT, CYP-450 and iNOS enzymes in response to ELF-EMF indicates an interaction between the ELF-EMF and the enzymological system. SIGNIFICANCE: These new insights might be important in establishing a mechanistic framework at the molecular level within which the possible effects of ELF-EMF on health can be understood.","['Patruno, Antonia', 'Tabrez, Shams', 'Pesce, Mirko', 'Shakil, Shazi', 'Kamal, Mohammad A', 'Reale, Marcella']","['Patruno A', 'Tabrez S', 'Pesce M', 'Shakil S', 'Kamal MA', 'Reale M']","[""Department of Medicine and Aging Science, University 'G. d'Annunzio' of Chieti-Pescara, Via dei Vestini, Chieti, Italy."", 'King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', ""Department of Medicine and Aging Science, University 'G. d'Annunzio' of Chieti-Pescara, Via dei Vestini, Chieti, Italy."", 'Department of Bioengineering, Integral University, Kursi Road, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Sciences, University ""G.d\'Annunzio"" Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy.

Comparable results were displayed at day +30 post-transplant, while better values by WT1 compared to MFC were found at day +90. Positive MRD by MFC predicted a shorter disease free survival (DFS) before and 1 month after transplant (p=0.006 and p=0.005), while only high WT1 levels at 1 month from the transplant significantly impacted on DFS (p=0.010). Our results support the idea that MRD monitoring by MFC should be suggested before and 30 days after the transplant, while WT1 expression should be preferred after this procedure.

DESIGN: A retrospective interventional consecutive case series. METHOD: Long-term maintenance treatment (>/=6 months) with topical 0.02% tacrolimus ointment was applied to patients with chronic ocular GVHD with ocular surface inflammation (at least grade 2 inflammatory score). We evaluated the inflammatory score, steroid score and steroid use period of total duration, and numbers of inflammatory aggravations before and after tacrolimus treatment. The clinical outcomes were assessed by symptom score, ocular surface staining, Schirmer I test, tear break-up time (TBUT), and classification of chronic GVHD conjunctivitis at the initial and final examinations. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (24 eyes) were treated with tacrolimus ointment for up to 20 months (average 12.2 months). The ocular surface inflammatory score decreased from 2.8 to 0.6 (P = .001) within 2-8 weeks after starting tacrolimus ointment treatment. The numbers of inflammatory aggravation and the need for steroid treatment also decreased after initiating tacrolimus treatment. At the final follow-up, all patients reported improvement in clinical outcomes, compared to initial findings. Except for blurred vision or mild burning sensation, there were no reported side effects. CONCLUSION: Considering the chronic course of GVHD, long-term maintenance treatment with tacrolimus ointment could be useful and safe to locally treat ocular surface inflammation in chronic ocular GVHD.","['Jung, Ji Won', 'Lee, Young Ji', 'Yoon, Sang Chul', 'Kim, Tae-Im', 'Kim, Eung Kweon', 'Seo, Kyoung Yul']","['Jung JW', 'Lee YJ', 'Yoon SC', 'Kim TI', 'Kim EK', 'Seo KY']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Yonsei Plus Eye Center, Kyonggido, South Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Institute of Vision Research, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

We examined the role that phosphorylation plays in the binding of the phosphoSIMs of PML and Daxx to SUMO1 at the atomic level. The crystal structures of SUMO1 bound to unphosphorylated and tetraphosphorylated PML-SIM peptides indicate that three phosphoserines directly contact specific positively charged residues of SUMO1. Surprisingly, the crystal structure of SUMO1 bound to a diphosphorylated Daxx-SIM peptide indicate that the hydrophobic residues of the phosphoSIM bind in a manner similar to that seen with PML, but important differences are observed when comparing the phosphorylated residues. Together, the results provide an atomic level description of how specific acetylation patterns within different SUMO family proteins can work together with phosphorylation of phosphoSIM's regions of target proteins to regulate binding specificity.","['Cappadocia, Laurent', 'Mascle, Xavier H', 'Bourdeau, Veronique', 'Tremblay-Belzile, Samuel', 'Chaker-Margot, Malik', 'Lussier-Price, Mathieu', 'Wada, Junya', 'Sakaguchi, Kazuyasu', 'Aubry, Muriel', 'Ferbeyre, Gerardo', 'Omichinski, James G']","['Cappadocia L', 'Mascle XH', 'Bourdeau V', 'Tremblay-Belzile S', 'Chaker-Margot M', 'Lussier-Price M', 'Wada J', 'Sakaguchi K', 'Aubry M', 'Ferbeyre G', 'Omichinski JG']","['Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Departement de Biochimie et Medicine Moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128 Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.

Therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often leads to significant reduction of disease burden, known as the deep molecular response (DMR). Herein, we decided to analyze the cohort of CML patients treated in our center with TKIs, who obtain and retain DMR for a period longer than 24 months. The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of clonal cytogenetic aberrations in Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) cells in patients with DMR during TKI treatment. The analyzed data was obtained during routine molecular and cytogenetic treatment monitoring, using G-banded trypsin and Giemsa stain (GTG) karyotyping and reverse transcription quantitative PCR. We noticed that approximately 50% of patients (28 of 55) in DMR had, at some follow-up point, transient changes in the karyotype of their Ph- bone marrow cells. In 9.1% of cases (5 of 55), the presence of the same aberrations was observed at different time points. The most frequently appearing aberrations were monosomies of chromosomes 19, 20, 21, and Y. Statistical analysis suggests that the occurrence of such abnormalities in CML patients correlates with the TKI treatment time.","['Gniot, Michal', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Ratajczak, Blazej', 'Lewandowska, Maria', 'Lehmann-Kopydlowska, Agata', 'Jarmuz-Szymczak, Malgorzata', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw']","['Gniot M', 'Lewandowski K', 'Ratajczak B', 'Lewandowska M', 'Lehmann-Kopydlowska A', 'Jarmuz-Szymczak M', 'Komarnicki M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Medical Sciences, Szamarzewskiego, Poznan, Poland.

To unravel these milestones we propose a framework, tumor evolutionary directed graphs (TEDG), which is able to characterize the history of genetic alterations by integrating longitudinal and cross-sectional genomic data. We applied TEDG to a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cohort of 70 patients spanning 12 years and show that: (a) the evolution of CLL follows a time-ordered process represented as a global flow in TEDG that proceeds from initiating events to late events; (b) there are two distinct and mutually exclusive evolutionary paths of CLL evolution; (c) higher fitness clones are present in later stages of the disease, indicating a progressive clonal replacement with more aggressive clones.

Mogamulizumab is the first approved glyco-engineered therapeutic antibody and first approved mAb to target the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). CCR4 is principally expressed on Tregs and helper T cells (Th) where it functions to induce homing of these leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Tregs play an essential role in maintaining immune balance; however, in malignancy, Tregs impair host antitumor immunity and provide a favorable environment for tumors to grow. CCR4 is highly expressed by aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs), particularly adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs). Mogamulizumab is a humanized anti-CCR4 mAb with a defucosylated Fc region that enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, mogamulizumab depletes CCR4(+) Tregs, potentially evoking antitumor immune responses by autologous effector cells. This ability is highly pertinent as subsets of malignant T cells are believed to function as CD4(+) Tregs, overexpressing CCR4. Clinical trials with mogamulizumab have demonstrated clinical efficacy and tolerability for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive T-cell lymphomas, previously associated with very poor outcomes.","['Remer, Marcus', 'Al-Shamkhani, Aymen', 'Glennie, Martin', 'Johnson, Peter']","['Remer M', 'Al-Shamkhani A', 'Glennie M', 'Johnson P']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, SO16 6YD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'ATL', 'CCR4', 'CTCL', 'FOXP3', 'PTCL', 'Treg cell', 'defucosylated Fc region', 'glyco-engineering']",2014/12/17 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.14.94 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2014;6(11):1187-206. doi: 10.2217/imt.14.94.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Protein Engineering', 'Receptors, CCR4/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/*metabolism']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",,,['13211/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor-derived MMC-DCs injected into the recipient prior to transplantation prolonged heart allograft survival. Although the generation of DCs is labour-intensive and time-consuming, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be easily harvested. In the present study, we analyse under which conditions DCs can be replaced by PBMCs and examine their mode of action. When injected into rats, MMC-incubated donor PBMCs (MICs) strongly prolonged heart allograft survival. Removal of monocytes from PBMCs completely abrogated their suppressive effect, indicating that monocytes are the active cell population. Suppression of rejection was donor-specific. The injected MICs migrated into peripheral lymphoid organs and led to an increased number of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) expressing cluster of differentiation (CD) markers CD4 and CD25 and forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3). Tolerance could be transferred to syngeneic recipients with blood or spleen cells. Depletion of Tregs from tolerogenic cells abrogated their suppressive effect, arguing for mediation of immunosuppression by CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs. Donor-derived MICs also prolonged kidney allograft survival in pigs. MICs generated from donor monocytes were applied for the first time in humans in a patient suffering from therapy-resistant rejection of a haploidentical stem cell transplant. We describe, in the present paper, a simple method for in vitro generation of suppressor blood cells for potential use in clinical organ transplantation. Although the case report does not allow us to draw any conclusion about their therapeutic effectiveness, it shows that MICs can be easily generated and applied in humans.","['Kleist, Christian', 'Sandra-Petrescu, Flavius', 'Jiga, Lucian', 'Dittmar, Laura', 'Mohr, Elisabeth', 'Greil, Johann', 'Mier, Walter', 'Becker, Luis E', 'Lang, Peter', 'Opelz, Gerhard', 'Terness, Peter']","['Kleist C', 'Sandra-Petrescu F', 'Jiga L', 'Dittmar L', 'Mohr E', 'Greil J', 'Mier W', 'Becker LE', 'Lang P', 'Opelz G', 'Terness P']","['*Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute for Immunology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '*Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute for Immunology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'daggerDepartment of Vascular Surgery, Division of Reconstructive Microsurgery, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.', '*Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute for Immunology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '*Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute for Immunology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'double daggerDepartment of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Child and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'section signDepartment of Radiology, Division of Nuclear Medicine, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'vertical lineDepartment of Internal Medicine I, Division of Nephrology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', ""paragraph signDepartment of Pediatric Oncology, Children's University Hospital, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany."", '*Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute for Immunology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '*Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute for Immunology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,,,,2014/12/17 06:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CS20140258 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20140258 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2015 May;128(9):593-607. doi: 10.1042/CS20140258.,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control', '*Graft Survival', 'Heart Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Swine', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Tolerance', 'Treatment Outcome']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, rat)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we developed a protein-facilitated electrocatalytic quadroprobe sensor (Sens(PEQ)) for detection of miRNA signature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in human serum. The developed signal-ON sensor provides a compatible combination of two DNA adaptor strands modified with four methylene blue molecules and electrocatalysis using glucose oxidase in order to enhance the overall signal gain. This enhanced sensitivity provided the response necessary to detect the low-abundant serum miRNAs without preamplification. The developed Sens(PEQ) is exquisitely sensitive to subtle pi-stack perturbations and capable of distinguishing single base mismatches in the target miRNA. Furthermore, the developed sensor was employed for profiling of three endogenous miRNAs characteristic to CLL, including hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, and hsa-miR-150-5p in normal healthy serum, chronic lymphocytic leukemia Rai stage 1 (CLL-1), and stage 3 (CLL-3) sera, using a non-human cel-miR-39-3p as an internal standard.

In this study, we investigated the effect of ramalin, a chemical compound from the Antarctic lichen Ramalina terebrata, on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression induced by TNF-alpha in vascular smooth muscular cells (VSMCs). Pretreatment of VSMCs with ramalin (0.1-10 mug/mL) concentration-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 expression. Additionally, ramalin inhibited THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cell adhesion to TNF-alpha-stimulated VSMCs. Ramalin suppressed TNF-alpha-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), PADI4 expression, and phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK. Moreover, ramalin inhibited TNF-alpha-induced translocation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. Inhibition of PADI4 expression by small interfering RNA or the PADI4-specific inhibitor markedly attenuated TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 and VCAM-1 expression in VSMCs.

PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Children with leukemia underwent LSBMD by cross-calibrated dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, with Z-scores generated according to Hologic and Lunar databases. VF were assessed by the Genant method on spine radiographs. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between fractures and LSBMD Z-scores. Net reclassification improvement and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of LSBMD Z-scores for VF. RESULTS: For the 186 children from 0 to 18 years of age, 6 different age ranges were studied. The Z-scores generated for the 0 to 18 group were highly correlated (r >/= 0.90), but the proportion of children with LSBMD Z-scores </=-2.0 among those with VF varied substantially (from 38-66%). Odds ratios (OR) for the association between LSBMD Z-score and VF were similar regardless of database (OR = 1.92, 95% confidence interval 1.44, 2.56 to OR = 2.70, 95% confidence interval 1.70, 4.28).

Inhibitors of HDACs (HDACi) induce acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins affecting gene expression, cell cycle progression, cell migration, terminal differentiation and cell death. Here, we analyzed the regulation of ARHGEF3, a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, by the HDACi MS275 (entinostat). MS275 is a well-known benzamide-based HDACi, which induces differentiation of the monoblastic-like human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 to monocytes/macrophages. Incubation of U937 cells with MS275 resulted in an up regulation of ARHGEF3, followed by a significant enhancement of the marker of macrophage differentiation CD68. ARHGEF3 protein is primarily nuclear, but MS275 treatment rapidly induced its translocation into the cytoplasm. ARHGEF3 cytoplasmic localization is associated with activation of the RhoA/Rho-associated Kinase (ROCK) pathway. In addition to cytoskeletal rearrangements orchestrated by RhoA, we showed that ARHGEF3/RhoA-dependent signals involve activation of SAPK/JNK and then Elk1 transcription factor. Importantly, MS275-induced CD68 expression was blocked by exposure of U937 cells to exoenzyme C3 transferase and Y27632, inhibitors of Rho and ROCK respectively. Moreover, ARHGEF3 silencing prevented RhoA activation leading to a reduction in SAPK/JNK phosphorylation, Elk1 activation and CD68 expression, suggesting a crucial role for ARHGEF3 in myeloid differentiation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ARHGEF3 modulates acute myeloid leukemia differentiation through activation of RhoA and pathways directly controlled by small GTPase family proteins. The finding that GEF protein modulation by HDAC inhibition impacts on cell differentiation may be important for understanding the antitumor mechanism(s) by which HDACi treatment stimulates differentiation in cancer.","[""D'Amato, Loredana"", ""Dell'Aversana, Carmela"", 'Conte, Mariarosaria', 'Ciotta, Alfonso', 'Scisciola, Lucia', 'Carissimo, Annamaria', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Altucci, Lucia']","[""D'Amato L"", ""Dell'Aversana C"", 'Conte M', 'Ciotta A', 'Scisciola L', 'Carissimo A', 'Nebbioso A', 'Altucci L']","['a Dipartimento di Biochimica, Biofisica e Patologia Generale ; Seconda Universita di Napoli ; Napoli , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150127,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,PMC4622697,['NOTNLM'],"['HDAC inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer', 'differentiation', 'signal transduction']",2014/12/17 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2014/12/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15592294.2014.988035 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2015;10(1):6-18. doi: 10.4161/15592294.2014.988035.

It can transform mast cells through activating mutations. Here, we show that a mutant Kit from neoplastic mast cells from mice, Kit(D814Y), is permanently active and allows cells to proliferate autonomously. It does so by activating two signalling pathways from different intracellular compartments. Mutant Kit from the cell surface accumulates on endolysosomes through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which requires Kit's kinase activity. Kit(D814Y) is constitutively associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but the complex activates Akt only on the cytoplasmic surface of endolysosomes. It resists destruction because it is under-ubiquitinated. Kit(D814Y) also appears in the endoplasmic reticulum soon after biosynthesis, and there, can activate STAT5 aberrantly. These mechanisms of oncogenic signalling are also seen in rat and human mast cell leukemia cells. Thus, oncogenic Kit signalling occurs from different intracellular compartments, and the mutation acts by altering Kit trafficking as well as activation.","['Obata, Yuuki', 'Toyoshima, Shota', 'Wakamatsu, Ei', 'Suzuki, Shunichi', 'Ogawa, Shuhei', 'Esumi, Hiroyasu', 'Abe, Ryo']","['Obata Y', 'Toyoshima S', 'Wakamatsu E', 'Suzuki S', 'Ogawa S', 'Esumi H', 'Abe R']","['Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.', '1] Division of Clinical Research, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan [2] National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141210,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC4284665,,,2014/12/11 06:00,2014/12/11 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms6715 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms6715 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Dec 10;5:5715. doi: 10.1038/ncomms6715.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 controls NOTCH1 protein stability. Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In this study we analyzed NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations in 50 South Indian T-ALL patients treated by a modified ALL BFM 95 regimen. The hot spot exons (HD-N, HD-C, TAD, and PEST) of NOTCH1 and exons 9 of the 10 of FBXW7 were polymerase chain reaction amplified and sequenced. In total, 20 of the 50 (40%) T-ALL patients revealed heterozygous mutations in the NOTCH1 domains, and a predominance of missense mutations in HD-N (70%) and PEST (15%) domains. FBXW7 mutations were detected in 5 of the 50 (10%) T-ALL patients. T-ALL patients with NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations expressed higher protein level of NOTCH1 compared with patients without NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations. Six of the mutations detected in NOTCH1 were not reported previously. When tested in a Dual Luciferase Renilla reporter assay some of these conferred increased NOTCH activity, suggesting that these are activating mutations. Importantly, 13 of the 20 (65%) NOTCH1/FBXW7-mutated T-ALL patients showed a good prednisone response (P=0.01) and a better clinical outcome compared with NOTCH1/FBXW7 nonmutated patients (P=0.03). These data suggest that NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations are present in T-ALL patients from Southern India and may be useful biomarkers to predict prognosis in T-ALL.","['Natarajan, Valliyammai', 'Bandapalli, Obul R', 'Rajkumar, Thangarajan', 'Sagar, Tenali Gnana', 'Karunakaran, Nirmala']","['Natarajan V', 'Bandapalli OR', 'Rajkumar T', 'Sagar TG', 'Karunakaran N']","['Departments of *Molecular Oncology double daggerMedical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamilnadu, India daggerDepartment of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,,2014/12/11 06:00,2015/02/26 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000290 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2015 Jan;37(1):e23-30. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000290.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are responsible for infections in neutropenic patients, however the most common microorganisms are Escherichia coli and coagulase-negative staphylococci, in decreasing order. Although Brucella spp. infections are endemic in Turkey, brucellosis-related febrile neutropenia has only rarely been reported. In this report, a case of brucellosis-related febrile neutropenia in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) was presented. A 56-year-old male patient presenting with fever, petechiae/purpura, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin level of 8.27 g/dl, leukocyte count of 77.100 k/ml, absolute neutrophil count of 200 k/ml, and platelets at 94.200 k/ml. The patient was diagnosed as AML-M1 and piperacillin/tazobactam was started as the first-line antibiotic therapy due to the febrile neutropenia. On admission, blood and urine cultures were negative. Once the fever was controlled, remission/induction chemotherapy was initiated. However, fever developed again on the eight day, and vancomycin was added to the therapy. Since the fever persisted, the antibiotic therapy was gradually replaced with meropenem and linezolid. However, fever continued and the patient's general condition deteriorated. Subsequently performed Brucella tube agglutination test revealed positivity at 1/320 titer and the microorganism grown in blood culture (Bactec 9050; BD, USA) was identified as B.melitensis by conventional methods. Rifampicin and doxycycline therapy was started immediately, however, the patient died due to septic shock. If the tests for brucellosis were performed earlier when response to second step antibiotic therapy lacked in this patient, it was assumed that mortality could be prevented by the prompt initiation of the appropriate treatment. Thus, since brucellosis is endemic in Turkey, it should be considered as a possible agent of febrile neutropenia especially in patients unresponsive to empiric antibiotherapy and appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed.","['Solmaz, Soner', 'Asma, Suheyl', 'Ozdogu, Hakan', 'Yeral, Mahmut', 'Turunc, Tuba']","['Solmaz S', 'Asma S', 'Ozdogu H', 'Yeral M', 'Turunc T']","['Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, Adana Teaching and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Adana, Turkey. drssolmaz@gmail.com.']",['tur'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,,,,2014/12/11 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.8082 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2014 Oct;48(4):669-73. doi: 10.5578/mb.8082.,,IM,"['Brucellosis/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Febrile Neutropenia/complications/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Shock, Septic/etiology']",,,Notropenik atesin ender bir nedeni: Bruselloz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Short stature is present in most patients. Isolated cases have demonstrated improved growth on growth hormone (GH) therapy. PROCEDURES: GH treatment data were obtained from 19 children with DBA (6 at our site and 13 from Genentech). Control data from 44 non-GH treated children were provided by Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry. Annual growth velocity (GV) and height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) were compared between groups and for up to 4y of GH treatment. RESULTS: Constructed DBA-specific male and female height-for-age charts for non-GH treated patients revealed short stature compared to CDC norms. GH-treated patients had significantly lower HAZ prior to treatment initiation compared to non-GH-treated controls. Among GH-treated patients, GV significantly improved in the first two years relative to pre-treatment. HAZ significantly improved in each of 4y of GH therapy compared to baseline. After 2y of therapy, HAZ for GH-treated patients were not significantly different from controls, demonstrating successful catch-up growth. CONCLUSIONS: GH treatment in children with DBA improves both GV and HAZ during treatment sustained for up to 4y. Very short children with DBA can be treated successfully with GH to restore stature to levels comparable to less affected patients. DBA height charts are useful tools for assessing age-specific growth in this typically short population. Careful consideration of individualized benefit of GH therapy versus risk is important in view of long-term underlying approximately 5% malignancy risk in DBA.","['Howell, Jonathan C', 'Joshi, Sarita A', 'Hornung, Lindsey', 'Khoury, Jane', 'Harris, Richard E', 'Rose, Susan R']","['Howell JC', 'Joshi SA', 'Hornung L', 'Khoury J', 'Harris RE', 'Rose SR']","[""Divisions of Endocrinology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20141209,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diamond Blackfan anemia', 'bone marrow failure', 'glucocorticoids', 'growth hormone', 'growth velocity', 'height', 'puberty', 'steroids']",2014/12/11 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25341 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Mar;62(3):402-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25341.

ZNFs were fabricated via the electrospinning process. The electrode was prepared by electrodeposition of quercetin on a zinc oxide nanofiber carbon paste electrode (Q/ZNFs/CPE). The Q/ZNFs/CPE offered substantially lower overpotential for electro-oxidation of UA in acetate buffer solution (ABS) (pH 4.45) compared with Q/CPE, ZNFs/CPE and bare CPE. Furthermore, the effects of pH, scan rate, accumulation time and potential, interference effect and effect of quercetin electrodeposition on the surface of ZNFs/CPE were studied in detail. The studies suggested that the electrode reaction process was totally irreversible and adsorption controlled. Differential pulse voltammogram peak current of UA increased linearly with its concentration within two dynamic ranges and detection limit for UA was 0.05 mumol L(-1) with RSD=0.2%. The prepared electrode was applied for determination of UA levels in serum and plasma of a healthy person and the patient with leukemia. The results indicated that the proposed method was sensitive, selective, fast and simple for determination of UA.","['Arvand, Majid', 'Tajyani, Sepideh', 'Ghodsi, Navid']","['Arvand M', 'Tajyani S', 'Ghodsi N']","['Electroanalytical Chemistry Laboratory, Faculty of Science, University of Guilan, Namjoo Street, P.O.

Overexpression of the gene coding for the transcription factor Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 (EVI1) is associated with rapid disease recurrence and shortened survival. We therefore sought to identify EVI1 target genes that may play a role in chemotherapy resistance using a previously established in vitro model system for EVI1 positive myeloid malignancies. Gene expression microarray analyses uncovered the Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (CADM1) gene as a candidate whose deregulation by EVI1 may contribute to drug refractoriness. CADM1 is an apoptosis inducing tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated by methylation in a variety of tumor types. In the present study we provide evidence that it may play a role in chemotherapy induced cell death in AML: CADM1 was induced by drugs used in the treatment of AML in a human myeloid cell line and in primary diagnostic AML samples, and its experimental expression in a cell line model increased the proportion of apoptotic cells. CADM1 up-regulation was abolished by ectopic expression of EVI1, and EVI1 expression correlated with increased CADM1 promoter methylation both in a cell line model and in primary AML cells. Finally, CADM1 induction was repressed in primary samples from AML patients at relapse. In summary, these data suggest that failure to up-regulate CADM1 in response to chemotherapeutic drugs may contribute to therapy resistance in AML.","['Fisser, Muriel C', 'Rommer, Anna', 'Steinleitner, Katarina', 'Heller, Gerwin', 'Herbst, Friederike', 'Wiese, Meike', 'Glimm, Hanno', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Fisser MC', 'Rommer A', 'Steinleitner K', 'Heller G', 'Herbst F', 'Wiese M', 'Glimm H', 'Sill H', 'Wieser R']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center of the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141209,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,,['NOTNLM'],"['CADM1', 'EVI1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy resistance', 'relapse']",2014/12/11 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.22252 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2015 Dec;54(12):1815-9. doi: 10.1002/mc.22252.

Both patients were referred for lymphocytosis and thrombocytosis. A bone marrow biopsy revealed infiltration of small, mature lymphocytes and megakaryocytic hyperplasia. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping and immunoglobulin (IG) gene clonality tests revealed clonal B lymphocytes. Both patients were positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation in whole bone marrow aspirate. The JAK2 V617F mutation was present in isolated B lymphocytes of patient 1, but not patient 2. Cytogenetics were normal in both patients.

The causes are unknown, but it is suggested that intrauterine tissues regulate fetal growth and survival in a sex-specific manner. We postulated that prorenin binding to its prorenin/renin receptor receptor (ATP6AP2) would act in a fetal sex-specific manner in human amnion to regulate the expression of promyelocytic zinc finger, a negative regulator of ATP6AP2 expression as well as 2 pathways that might influence the onset of labor, namely transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFB1) and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). Our findings demonstrate that there are strong interactions between prorenin, ATP6AP2, and TGFB1 and that this system has a greater capacity in female amnion to stimulate profibrotic pathways, thus maintaining the integrity of the fetal membranes.

Several MMTV strains have been shown to productively infect, in addition to murine cells, various heterologous cell lines including those of human origin, albeit less efficiently than murine cells. Here, we analysed whether MMTV from C3H mice [MMTV(C3H)], reported previously to be incapable of infecting human cells, could productively infect human cells. Using a recently described high-titre MMTV-based vector carrying MMTV(C3H) envelope protein (Env), we successfully transduced cells of human origin. Furthermore, WT MMTV(C3H) was able to infect human cells, albeit less efficiently than mouse cells. The established infection was, however, sufficient to enable virus spread to every cell in culture. The infectivity of WT MMTV(C3H) and MMTV-based vectors carrying MMTV(C3H)Env was blocked by heat inactivation, an inhibitor of reverse transcription (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine) and pre-incubation with neutralizing anti-MMTV antibodies that did not neutralize vectors pseudotyped with amphotropic murine leukemia virus Env, providing evidence for an authentic, receptor-mediated and reverse transcriptase-dependent infection process. Persistently infected human Hs578T cells produced infectious virions capable of infecting naive human breast cells in culture, the infectivity of which could also be blocked by neutralizing anti-MMTV antibodies, demonstrating that virus particles released by the persistently infected Hs578T cells were related antigenically to the virus produced from murine cells. Taken together, our results show that MMTV(C3H), like MMTV(GR) and MMTV(RIII), is able not only to infect but also to replicate in cultured human breast cells.","['Konstantoulas, Constantine James', 'Indik, Stanislav']","['Konstantoulas CJ', 'Indik S']","['Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinaerplatz 1, 1210 Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinaerplatz 1, 1210 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141209,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,,,2014/12/11 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.000006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2015 Mar;96(Pt 3):650-662. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.000006.

HIV-1 MA also interacts with RNA, which prevents Gag from binding to membranes containing phosphatidylserine, a prevalent cellular acidic phospholipid. These results suggest that the MA-bound RNA promotes PM-specific localization of HIV-1 Gag by blocking nonspecific interactions with cellular membranes that do not contain PI(4,5)P2. To examine whether PI(4,5)P2 dependence and RNA-mediated inhibition collectively determine MA phenotypes across a broad range of retroviruses and elucidate the significance of their interrelationships, we compared a panel of Gag-leucine zipper constructs (GagLZ) containing MA of different retroviruses. We found that in vitro membrane binding of GagLZ via HIV-1 MA and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) MA is both PI(4,5)P2 dependent and susceptible to RNA-mediated inhibition. The PM-specific localization and virus-like particle (VLP) release of these GagLZ proteins are severely impaired by overexpression of a PI(4,5)P2-depleting enzyme, polyphosphoinositide 5-phosphatase IV (5ptaseIV). In contrast, membrane binding of GagLZ constructs that contain human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) MA, murine leukemia virus (MLV) MA, and human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) MA is PI(4,5)P2 independent and not blocked by RNA. The PM localization and VLP release of these GagLZ chimeras were much less sensitive to 5ptaseIV expression. Notably, single amino acid substitutions that confer a large basic patch rendered HTLV-1 MA susceptible to the RNA-mediated block, suggesting that RNA readily blocks MA containing a large basic patch, such as HIV-1 and RSV MA. Further analyses of these MA mutants suggest a possibility that HIV-1 and RSV MA acquired PI(4,5)P2 dependence to alleviate the membrane binding block imposed by RNA. IMPORTANCE: MA basic residues in the HIV-1 structural protein Gag interact with phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and RNA. RNA inhibits HIV-1 MA binding to non-PI(4,5)P2 acidic lipids. This inhibition may promote PM specificity of Gag membrane binding, an early essential step in virus assembly. However, whether and how relationships between these interactions have developed among retroviruses are poorly understood. In this study, by comparing diverse retroviral MA domains, we elucidated a strong correlation among PI(4,5)P2 dependence, susceptibility to RNA-mediated inhibition, and cellular behaviors of Gag. Mutagenesis analyses suggest that a large basic patch on MA is sufficient to confer susceptibility to RNA-mediated inhibition but not for PI(4,5)P2-dependent membrane binding. Our findings highlight RNA's role as a general blocker of large basic patches and suggest a possibility that some retroviruses, including HIV-1, have evolved to bind PI(4,5)P2, while others have adopted smaller basic patches on their MA domains, to overcome the RNA-mediated restriction of membrane binding.","['Inlora, Jingga', 'Collins, David R', 'Trubin, Marc E', 'Chung, Ji Yeon J', 'Ono, Akira']","['Inlora J', 'Collins DR', 'Trubin ME', 'Chung JY', 'Ono A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA akiraono@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141209,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,PMC4324246,,,2014/12/11 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.02202-14 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.02202-14 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2014 Dec 9;5(6):e02202. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02202-14.,['Copyright (c) 2014 Inlora et al.'],IM,"['Cell Membrane/*virology', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*physiology']","['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,"['R01 AI071727/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007528/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008353/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Among 605 patients included in the French SCN registry, we identified 8 pedigrees that included 14 patients with autosomal recessive G6PC3 mutations. RESULTS: Median age at the last visit was 22.4 years. All patients had developed various comordibities, including prominent veins (n = 12), cardiac malformations (n = 12), intellectual disability (n = 7), and myopathic syndrome with recurrent painful cramps (n = 1). Three patients developed Crohn's disease, and five had chronic diarrhea with steatorrhea. Neutropenia was profound (<0.5 x 109/l) in almost all cases at diagnosis and could marginally fluctuate. The bone marrow smears exhibited mild late-stage granulopoeitic defects. One patient developed myelodysplasia followed by acute myelogenous leukemia with translocation (18, 21) at age 14 years, cured by chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Four deaths occurred, including one from sepsis at age 5, one from pulmonary late-stage insufficiency at age 19, and two from sudden death, both at age 30 years. A new homozygous mutation (c.249G > A /p.Trp83*) was detected in one pedigree. CONCLUSIONS: Severe congenital neutropenia with autosomal recessive G6PC3 mutations is associated with considerable clinical heterogeneity. This series includes the first described case of malignancy in this neutropenia.","['Desplantes, Claire', 'Fremond, Marie Louise', 'Beaupain, Blandine', 'Harousseau, Jean Luc', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Pellier, Isabelle', 'Roques, Gaelle', 'Morville, Pierre', 'Paillard, Catherine', 'Bruneau, Julie', 'Pinson, Lucile', 'Jeziorski, Eric', 'Vannier, Jean Pierre', 'Picard, Capucine', 'Bellanger, Florence', 'Romero, Norma', 'de Pontual, Loic', 'Lapillonne, Helene', 'Lutz, Patrick', 'Chantelot, Christine Bellanne', 'Donadieu, Jean']","['Desplantes C', 'Fremond ML', 'Beaupain B', 'Harousseau JL', 'Buzyn A', 'Pellier I', 'Roques G', 'Morville P', 'Paillard C', 'Bruneau J', 'Pinson L', 'Jeziorski E', 'Vannier JP', 'Picard C', 'Bellanger F', 'Romero N', 'de Pontual L', 'Lapillonne H', 'Lutz P', 'Chantelot CB', 'Donadieu J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,PMC4279596,,,2014/12/11 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['s13023-014-0183-8 [pii]', '10.1186/s13023-014-0183-8 [doi]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2014 Dec 10;9:183. doi: 10.1186/s13023-014-0183-8.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Glucose-6-Phosphatase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Pedigree', '*Registries', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Young Adult']","['EC 3.1.3.9 (Glucose-6-Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.9.

We investigated the role of chemokine (C-X-C-motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) and its cognate receptor, chemokine (C-X-C-motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) in arteriogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: After femoral artery ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats, either native collaterals were harvested or placebo, CXCL1 or CXCR2 blocker was administered via an osmopump. Perfusion recovery was measured with Laser Doppler, leukocyte populations were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and hind limb sections were stained for macrophage marker cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68). In vitro, fluorescent CXCL1 or human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) monocytic cells were flown over shear-stressed endothelium. CXCL1 mRNA expression in collaterals was dramatically upregulated already 1 h after ligation (ratio ligated/sham 5.73). CD68 mRNA was upregulated from 12 h until 3 days after ligation (peak ratio ligated/sham 2.65). CXCL1 treatment augmented perfusion recovery at 3 and 7 days (p < 0.05) after ligation, and a significant increase in the number of peri-collateral macrophages was evident concomitantly (p < 0.05). Conversely, CXCR2 antagonist treatment caused a decrease in perfusion recovery both at 7 and 10 days postligation (p = 0.01) and also significantly reduced the number of peri-collateral macrophages (p < 0.05). In vitro, CXCL1 tethered to and was taken up by endothelial cells under shear stress conditions and enhanced THP-1 adherence compared to control (p < 0.05). In contrast, CXCR2 antagonist compromised THP-1 adherence to endothelial cells (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CXCL1 presented on the luminal endothelial surface leads to an increase in the number of peri-collateral macrophages, thus improving the arteriogenic response after arterial ligation.","['Vries, Mark H M', 'Wagenaar, Allard', 'Verbruggen, Sanne E L', 'Molin, Daniel G M', 'Dijkgraaf, Ingrid', 'Hackeng, Tilman H', 'Post, Mark J']","['Vries MH', 'Wagenaar A', 'Verbruggen SE', 'Molin DG', 'Dijkgraaf I', 'Hackeng TH', 'Post MJ']","['Department of Physiology, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Center, Universiteitssingel 50 6229 ER, P.O.

The first, carrying a missense R174Q mutation, which acts as a dominant-negative mutant, is associated with thrombocytopenia and leukemia, and the second, carrying a monoallelic gene deletion inducing a haploinsufficiency, presents only as thrombocytopenia. Hematopoietic differentiation of these iPSC clones demonstrated profound defects in erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis and deregulated expression of RUNX1 targets. iPSC clones from patients with the R174Q mutation specifically generated an increased amount of granulomonocytes, a phenotype reproduced by an 80% RUNX1 knockdown in the H9 human embryonic stem cell line, and a genomic instability. This phenotype, found only with a lower dosage of RUNX1, may account for development of leukemia in patients. Altogether, RUNX1 dosage could explain the differential phenotype according to RUNX1 mutations, with a haploinsufficiency leading to thrombocytopenia alone in a majority of cases whereas a more complete gene deletion predisposes to leukemia.","['Antony-Debre, Ileana', 'Manchev, Vladimir T', 'Balayn, Nathalie', 'Bluteau, Dominique', 'Tomowiak, Cecile', 'Legrand, Celine', 'Langlois, Thierry', 'Bawa, Olivia', 'Tosca, Lucie', 'Tachdjian, Gerard', 'Leheup, Bruno', 'Debili, Najet', 'Plo, Isabelle', 'Mills, Jason A', 'French, Deborah L', 'Weiss, Mitchell J', 'Solary, Eric', 'Favier, Remi', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Raslova, Hana']","['Antony-Debre I', 'Manchev VT', 'Balayn N', 'Bluteau D', 'Tomowiak C', 'Legrand C', 'Langlois T', 'Bawa O', 'Tosca L', 'Tachdjian G', 'Leheup B', 'Debili N', 'Plo I', 'Mills JA', 'French DL', 'Weiss MJ', 'Solary E', 'Favier R', 'Vainchenker W', 'Raslova H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Hematologie Biologique, Universite Paris-Est Creteil, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France; Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France;', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France;', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris, France;', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, Poitiers, France;"", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;', 'Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France;', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U935-Hopitaux Universitaires Paris-Sud, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Service d'Histologie Embryologie et Cytogenetique, Clamart, France;"", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U935-Hopitaux Universitaires Paris-Sud, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Service d'Histologie Embryologie et Cytogenetique, Clamart, France;"", 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nancy, Pole Enfant, Service de Medecine Infantile et de Genetique Clinique, Vandoeuvre-Les-Nancy, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Lorraine, Vandoeuvre-Les-Nancy, France;', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', ""Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Trousseau, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Paris, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141209,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4347283,,,2014/12/11 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/12/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39476-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-585513 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 5;125(6):930-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-585513.

With the effects of ammonium chloride (NH4 Cl) lysis on erythroid progenitors previously described, we applied this protocol to a patient cohort with diagnosed MDS to investigate phenotypic abnormalities that indicate erythroid dysplasia. METHOD: Bone marrow specimens [39 MDS, 9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 7 JAK2(V617F) positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and 5 nutritional deficiencies] were processed by NH4 Cl lysis and Ficoll preparation and evaluated by MDF using a difference from normal algorithm. RESULTS: For the MDS cohort, phenotypic abnormalities on the mature erythroid progenitors were frequent for CD71 and CD36 (36% for each antigen); abnormalities for CD235a (8%) were observed. Among immature erythroid progenitors, abnormal maturation patterns (</=5%), and increased CD105 intensity (9%) were seen. Increased frequency of CD105 bright cells was observed (18%). While antigenic abnormalities correlated between NH4 Cl lysis and Ficoll preparation, the lysis method demonstrated the most consistent quantitative antigen intensities. Mean erythroid phenotypic abnormalities and prognostic cytogenetic subgroups correlated strongly. Morphologic and erythroid phenotypic abnormalities correlated, as did increasing FCSS and number of erythroid abnormalities, albeit without further increase for AML patients. DISCUSSION: These data expand the understanding of erythropoiesis and define immunophenotypic abnormalities that indicate dyserythropoiesis in MDS using a lysis protocol practical for routine implementation in clinical flow cytometric workup. Preliminary studies also indicate strong correlation between phenotypic erythroid dysplasia and poor prognosis, as classified cytogenetically.","['Eidenschink Brodersen, Lisa', 'Menssen, Andrew J', 'Wangen, Jamie R', 'Stephenson, Christine F', 'de Baca, Monica E', 'Zehentner, Barbara K', 'Wells, Denise A', 'Loken, Michael R']","['Eidenschink Brodersen L', 'Menssen AJ', 'Wangen JR', 'Stephenson CF', 'de Baca ME', 'Zehentner BK', 'Wells DA', 'Loken MR']","['HematoLogics, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141210,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

This work was focused on the identification of the main factors leading to the enhancement of SO production using Rose Bengal (RB), and Methylene Blue (MB) as PS species in organic and aqueous mediums. Subsequently, the capacity of zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc sulfide (ZnS), and ZnO/ZnS core-shell QDs as well as manganese (Mn(+2)) doped ZnO and ZnS nanoparticles (NPs) as potential PS was also investigated. Many variable parameters such as type of quencher, PSs, NPs, as well as its different concentrations, light source, excitation wavelength, reaction time, distance from light source, and nature of solvent were used. The degradation kinetics of the quenchers generated by SO species and the corresponding quantum yields were determined by monitoring the photo-oxidation of the chemical quencher and measuring its disappearance by fluorometry and spectrophotometry in the presence of NPs. Small intracellular changes of SO induced by these metal Zn (zinc) NPs and PDT could execute and accelerate deadly programs in these leukemic cells, providing in this way an innovative modality of treatment. In order to perform further more specific in vitro cytotoxic studies on B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells exposed to Zn NPs and PDT, we needed first to measure and ascertain those possible intracellular SO variations generated by this type of treatment; for this purpose, we have also developed and tested a novel method first described by us.","['Pena Luengas, Sandra L', 'Marin, Gustavo Horacio', 'Aviles, Kevin', 'Cruz Acuna, Ricardo', 'Roque, Gustavo', 'Rodriguez Nieto, Felipe', 'Sanchez, Francisco', 'Tarditi, Adrian', 'Rivera, Luis', 'Mansilla, Eduardo']","['Pena Luengas SL', 'Marin GH', 'Aviles K', 'Cruz Acuna R', 'Roque G', 'Rodriguez Nieto F', 'Sanchez F', 'Tarditi A', 'Rivera L', 'Mansilla E']","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico , Puerto Rico .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,PMC4267548,['NOTNLM'],"['B-CLL', 'chemotherapy', 'lymphoma', 'targeted therapy', 'treatment']",2014/12/10 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cbr.2014.1718 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2014 Dec;29(10):435-43. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2014.1718.,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Manganese/administration & dosage', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage', 'Photochemotherapy/methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/administration & dosage', 'Quantum Dots/administration & dosage', 'Singlet Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Sulfides/administration & dosage', 'Zinc Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Zinc Oxide/administration & dosage']","['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'KPS085631O (zinc sulfide)', 'SOI2LOH54Z (Zinc Oxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the contribution of DNA methylation to heterogeneity within tumors, we performed genome-scale bisulfite sequencing of 104 primary chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs). Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, CLLs consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of DNA methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome. We therefore propose that disordered methylation plays a similar role to that of genetic instability, enhancing the ability of cancer cells to search for superior evolutionary trajectories.","['Landau, Dan A', 'Clement, Kendell', 'Ziller, Michael J', 'Boyle, Patrick', 'Fan, Jean', 'Gu, Hongcang', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Sougnez, Carrie', 'Wang, Lili', 'Li, Shuqiang', 'Kotliar, Dylan', 'Zhang, Wandi', 'Ghandi, Mahmoud', 'Garraway, Levi', 'Fernandes, Stacey M', 'Livak, Kenneth J', 'Gabriel, Stacey', 'Gnirke, Andreas', 'Lander, Eric S', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Kharchenko, Peter V', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Getz, Gad', 'Meissner, Alexander', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Landau DA', 'Clement K', 'Ziller MJ', 'Boyle P', 'Fan J', 'Gu H', 'Stevenson K', 'Sougnez C', 'Wang L', 'Li S', 'Kotliar D', 'Zhang W', 'Ghandi M', 'Garraway L', 'Fernandes SM', 'Livak KJ', 'Gabriel S', 'Gnirke A', 'Lander ES', 'Brown JR', 'Neuberg D', 'Kharchenko PV', 'Hacohen N', 'Getz G', 'Meissner A', 'Wu CJ']","['Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA; Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""Center for Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Cancer Center and Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

Given the particular side effects of clozapine including neutropenia and myelosuppression, safety and efficacy of add-on chemotherapy for patients who are already under clozapine treatment remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: We present evidence from a patient with a diagnosis of refractory schizophrenia on clozapine medication, who required essential chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have also reviewed literature regarding this challenging clinical dilemma. METHOD: We report details about a patient with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who was given chemotherapy (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab) for CLL in the course of concomitant treatment with clozapine and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSFs). In addition, we have reviewed literature using the PUBMED data base. RESULTS: Current evidence remains insufficient to provide authoritative guide to clinicians regarding the efficacy and safety of the combined use of clozapine and chemotherapy. However, general conclusion from our case and of the published evidence is that a combination of clozapine use and chemotherapeutic agents do not cause additional hematological worsening with no decreasing efficacy concerns raised. CONCLUSION: Continuing with clozapine in the course of chemotherapy may be relatively safer for patients who responded well to clozapine concomitant with G-CSF treatment.","['Usta, Nazife Gamze', 'Poyraz, Cana Aksoy', 'Aktan, Melih', 'Duran, Alaattin']","['Usta NG', 'Poyraz CA', 'Aktan M', 'Duran A']","['Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, University of Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul, Turkey, Halaskargazi cad.

CCR4 mutations were detected in 14/53 ATLL samples (26%) and consisted exclusively of nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncated the coding region at C329, Q330, or Y331 in the carboxy terminus. Functionally, the CCR4-Q330 nonsense isoform was gain-of-function because it increased cell migration toward the CCR4 ligands CCL17 and CCL22, in part by impairing receptor internalization. This mutant enhanced PI(3) kinase/AKT activation after receptor engagement by CCL22 in ATLL cells and conferred a growth advantage in long-term in vitro cultures. These findings implicate somatic gain-of-function CCR4 mutations in the pathogenesis of ATLL and suggest that inhibition of CCR4 signaling might have therapeutic potential in this refractory malignancy.","['Nakagawa, Masao', 'Schmitz, Roland', 'Xiao, Wenming', 'Goldman, Carolyn K', 'Xu, Weihong', 'Yang, Yandan', 'Yu, Xin', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Staudt, Louis M']","['Nakagawa M', 'Schmitz R', 'Xiao W', 'Goldman CK', 'Xu W', 'Yang Y', 'Yu X', 'Waldmann TA', 'Staudt LM']","['Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892 lstaudt@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC4267233,,,2014/12/10 06:00,2015/03/17 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20140987 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20140987 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2014 Dec 15;211(13):2497-505. doi: 10.1084/jem.20140987.

Precise estimates of the risk, presentation, and outcomes of cancer in patients with AT need to be addressed in large series. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this large retrospective cohort, 69 patients with cancers (24.5%) were identified among 279 patients with AT. Centralized review was performed on 60% of the lymphomas. Incidence rates were compared with the French population, and risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight patients developed acute leukemias (including four T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias), 12 developed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 38 developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), three developed T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), and eight developed carcinoma at a median age of 8.3, 10.6, 9.7, 24.2, and 31.4 years, respectively (P < .001). The majority of NHLs were aggressive B-cell NHL. Epstein-Barr virus was associated with all of the HLs and 50% of the NHLs. Overall survival was shorter in patients with AT who developed cancer compared with those who did not develop cancer (15 v 24 years, respectively; P < .001). Survival was improved in patients who achieved a major response to treatment (3.46 v 0.87 years for major v minor responses, respectively; P = .011). Immunodeficiency was associated with increased risk of cancer. ATM mutation type was associated with a difference in survival in the entire cohort but not with cancer incidence or cancer survival. CONCLUSION: B-cell NHL, HL, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia occur at a high rate and earlier age than carcinomas in AT. T-PLLs are rarer than initially reported. Prognosis is poor, but patients may benefit from treatment with an improved survival.","['Suarez, Felipe', 'Mahlaoui, Nizar', 'Canioni, Danielle', 'Andriamanga, Chantal', ""Dubois d'Enghien, Catherine"", 'Brousse, Nicole', 'Jais, Jean-Philippe', 'Fischer, Alain', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet, Dominique']","['Suarez F', 'Mahlaoui N', 'Canioni D', 'Andriamanga C', ""Dubois d'Enghien C"", 'Brousse N', 'Jais JP', 'Fischer A', 'Hermine O', 'Stoppa-Lyonnet D']","[""Felipe Suarez, Nizar Mahlaoui, Danielle Canioni, Nicole Brousse, Jean-Philippe Jais, Alain Fischer, and Olivier Hermine, Hopital Universitaire Necker-Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris;

To counteract WWOX's suppressive effects, cancer cells have developed many strategies either to downregulate WWOX expression or to functionally inactivate WWOX. Relatively unknown is, in the context of those cancers associated with certain viruses or bacteria, how the oncogenic pathogens deal with WWOX. Here we review recent studies showing different strategies utilized by three cancer-associated pathogens. Helicobactor pylori reduces WWOX expression through promoter hypermethylation, an epigenetic mechanism also occurring in many other cancer cells. WWOX has a potential to block canonical NF-kappaB activation and tumorigenesis induced by Tax, an oncoprotein of human T-cell leukemia virus. Tax successfully overcomes the blockage by inhibiting WWOX expression through activation of the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway. On the other hand, latent membrane protein 2A of Epstein-Barr virus physically interacts with WWOX and redirects its function to trigger a signaling pathway that upregulates matrix metalloproteinase 9 and cancer cell invasion. These reports may be just ""the tip of the iceberg"" regarding multiple interactions between WWOX and oncogenic microbes. Further studies in this direction should expand our understanding of infection-driven oncogenesis.","['Chang, Yao', 'Lan, Yu-Yan', 'Hsiao, Jenn-Ren', 'Chang, Nan-Shan']","['Chang Y', 'Lan YY', 'Hsiao JR', 'Chang NS']","['National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan 70456, Taiwan Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, Medical College, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan yaochang@nhri.org.tw.', 'National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan 70456, Taiwan Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, Medical College, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Medical College and Hospital, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Medical College, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141207,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,PMC4935232,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'Helicobactor pylori', 'WW domain-containing oxidoreductase', 'human T-cell leukemia virus', 'infection-associated cancers']",2014/12/10 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1535370214561957 [pii]', '10.1177/1535370214561957 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2015 Mar;240(3):329-37. doi: 10.1177/1535370214561957.

The initiation of intensive chemotherapy is necessary to control further progression of the disease. Therapeutic success is less common in older patients (> 65 years) than it is in younger patients with AML. Cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline has been the mainstays of AML therapy for many years and continues to serve as the foundation for the current standard therapeutic regimen. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the pharmacokinetic (PK), metabolic and toxicological issues associated with antileukemic agents used to treat elderly patients (> 60 years) with AML. EXPERT OPINION: Profound and predictable changes often occur with age and can have effects on drug metabolism, PK and toxicity with consequences bearing on overall efficacy. Few studies focus specifically on elderly patients with AML, but modifications to intensive induction therapy may be beneficial as the current number and rate of individuals achieving complete remission of the disease remains low. Therapeutic options, for the treatment of AML, have remained static for many years, but it has become clear that among elderly patients with AML, improved antileukemic therapy is greatly needed.","['Kaur, Imit', 'Constance, Jonathan E', 'Kosak, Ken M', 'Spigarelli, Michael G', 'Sherwin, Catherine M T']","['Kaur I', 'Constance JE', 'Kosak KM', 'Spigarelli MG', 'Sherwin CM']","['University of Utah School of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pediatrics , 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City , UT 84108 , USA +1 801 587 7404 ; +1 801 585 9410 ; Catherine.Sherwin@hsc.utah.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141209,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'elderly', 'induction phase', 'metabolism', 'pharmacokinetics', 'toxicity']",2014/12/10 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17425255.2015.972934 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2015 Jan;11(1):53-65. doi: 10.1517/17425255.2015.972934.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are able to secrete VEGFA and express VEGFA receptors, thus it can be hypothesized that VEGFA-mediated signaling influences CLL clone survival. In this case-control study we verified whether inherited differences in activities of VEGFA and its main receptor VEGFR2 impact predisposition to CLL or the course of the disease. Four functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including two SNPs in VEGFA gene, namely rs2010963 (+405G>C) and rs3025039 (+936C>T) and two SNPs in VEGFR2 gene including rs7667298 (-271G>A) and rs1870377 (+1719A>T) were genotyped using PCR-based assays in 223 Caucasian CLL patients and 150 matched controls. Regarding VEGF rs2010963 SNP, we observed an association between CLL and allele C distribution with an OR of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.002-2.312), p=0.04. The distribution of other genotypes and alleles was similar in CLL and control groups. No genotype or allele was significantly associated with important prognostic factors in CLL including clinical stage, IgVH mutational status, ZAP-70 expression and FISH cytogenetic abnormalities. In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that genetic polymorphisms in VEGFA mediated pathway may influence the susceptibility to CLL.","['Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Szemraj, Janusz', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof']","['Gora-Tybor J', 'Szemraj J', 'Robak T', 'Jamroziak K']","['Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.

These patients may develop splenomegaly and require splenectomy to alleviate mechanical symptoms, to ameliorate transfusion-dependent cytopenias, or to enhance stem cell transplantation. The objective of this study was to determine which clinical variables significantly impacted morbidity, mortality, and survival in patients with myeloid neoplasms undergoing splenectomy, and to determine if operative outcomes have improved over time. METHODS: The records of all patients with myeloid neoplasms undergoing splenectomy from 1993 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients (n = 89) underwent splenectomy for myeloid neoplasms. Over half of patients who had symptoms preoperatively had resolution of their symptoms post-splenectomy. The morbidity rate was 38%, with the most common complications being bleeding (14%) or infection (20%). Thirty-day mortality rate was 18% and median survival after splenectomy was 278 days. Decreased survival was associated with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, anemia, abnormal white blood cell count, and hypoalbuminemia. Patients who underwent stem cell transplantation did not show an increased risk for morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with myeloid neoplasms have a poor prognosis after splenectomy and the decision to operate is a difficult one, associated with high morbidity and mortality.","['Rialon, Kristy L', 'Speicher, Paul J', 'Ceppa, Eugene P', 'Rendell, Victoria R', 'Vaslef, Steven N', 'Beaven, Anne', 'Tyler, Douglas S', 'Blazer, Dan G 3rd']","['Rialon KL', 'Speicher PJ', 'Ceppa EP', 'Rendell VR', 'Vaslef SN', 'Beaven A', 'Tyler DS', 'Blazer DG 3rd']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141209,United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'hypersplenism', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'splenomegaly']",2014/12/10 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jso.23846 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 2015 Mar 15;111(4):389-95. doi: 10.1002/jso.23846.

We investigated associations between levels of blood eosinophils and risks of hematological malignancies and mortality in order to provide clinically derived cut-offs for referral to specialist hematology care. From the Copenhagen Primary Care Differential Count (CopDiff) Database, we identified 356,196 individuals with at least one differential cell count encompassing the eosinophil count during 2000-2007 and matched these laboratory data with Danish nationwide health registers. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for the 4-year incidences of hematological malignancies and mortality between the eosinophil counts and a reference count of 0.16 x 10(9) /l which was the median eosinophil count in our data. Risks of hematological malignancies and mortality increased above the median eosinophil count. At the 99th percentile, corresponding to an eosinophil count of 0.75 x 10(9) /l, risks of hematological malignancies were increased more than twofold with OR (95% C.I.) of 2.39 (1.91-2.99). Interestingly, risks reached a plateau around an eosinophil count of 1.0 x 10(9) /l. Risks also increased when the eosinophil count approached zero. Here, counts associated relatively more with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes whereas counts above 0.16 x 10(9) /l associated more with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Eosinophil counts associate with hematological malignancies and mortality even below the definition of eosinophilia. The observed plateau of risks around 1.0 x 10(9) /l is important for physicians encountering patients with eosinophilia since even mild-to-moderate eosinophilia according to traditional definitions confers maximally increased risks of subsequent/subclinical hematological malignancy.","['Andersen, Christen L', 'Siersma, Volkert D', 'Hasselbalch, Hans C', 'Vestergaard, Hanne', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Felding, Peter', 'Olivarius, Niels D F', 'Bjerrum, Ole W']","['Andersen CL', 'Siersma VD', 'Hasselbalch HC', 'Vestergaard H', 'Mesa R', 'Felding P', 'Olivarius ND', 'Bjerrum OW']","['Department of Hematology, Roskilde University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark; The Research Unit for General Practice and Section of General Practice, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150116,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2014/12/10 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23916 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Mar;90(3):225-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23916.

An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry was undertaken to assess practice patterns before and after the publication of this landmark study. METHODS: The SEER database from 2000 to 2009 was used to identify 40,583 women aged >/=70 years who were treated with breast-conserving surgery for clinical stage I, estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer. The percentage of patients receiving radiotherapy and the type of radiotherapy delivered was assessed over time. Administration of radiotherapy was further assessed across age groups; SEER cohort; and tumor size, grade, and laterality. RESULTS: Approximately 68.6% of patients treated between 2000 and 2004 compared with 61.7% of patients who were treated between 2005 and 2009 received some form of adjuvant radiotherapy (P < .001). Coinciding with a decline in the use of external beam radiotherapy, there was an increase in the use of implant radiotherapy from 1.4% between 2000 and 2004 to 6.2% between 2005 to 2009 (P < .001). There were significant reductions in the frequency of radiotherapy delivery over time across age groups, tumor size, and tumor grade and regardless of laterality (P < .001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Randomized phase 3 data support the omission of adjuvant radiotherapy in elderly women with early-stage breast cancer. Analysis of practice patterns before and after the publication of these data indicates a significant decline in radiotherapy use; however, nearly two-thirds of women continue to receive adjuvant radiotherapy.","['Palta, Manisha', 'Palta, Priya', 'Bhavsar, Nrupen A', 'Horton, Janet K', 'Blitzblau, Rachel C']","['Palta M', 'Palta P', 'Bhavsar NA', 'Horton JK', 'Blitzblau RC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141208,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343', 'breast cancer', 'elderly', 'radiotherapy', 'use']",2014/12/10 06:00,2015/03/10 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28937 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jan 15;121(2):188-93. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28937.

AMG 925, a dual FLT3/CDK4 inhibitor, has been developed to overcome this resistance. It is hypothesized that the combined inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4 may reduce occurrence of the FLT3 resistance mutations, and thereby prolong clinical responses. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to isolate AML cell clones resistant to AMG 925 or to FLT3 inhibitors. After a selection of over 8 months with AMG 925, we could only isolate partially resistant clones. No new mutations in FLT3 were found, but a 2- to 3-fold increase in total FLT3 protein was detected and believed to contribute to the partial resistance. In contrast, selection with the FLT3 inhibitors sorafenib or AC220 (Quizartinib), led to a resistance and the appearance of a number of mutations in FLT3 kinase domains, including the known hot spot sites D835 and F691. However, when AC220 was combined with the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 (palbociclib) at 0.1 mumol/L or higher, no resistance mutations were obtained, indicating that the CDK4-inhibiting activity of AMG 925 contributed to the failure to develop drug resistance. AMG 925 was shown to potently inhibit the FLT3 inhibitor-resistant mutation D835Y/V. This feature of AMG 925 was also considered to contribute to the lack of resistance mutations to the compound. Together, our data suggest that AMG 925 has the potential to reduce resistance mutations in FLT3 and may prolong clinical responses.","['Li, Cong', 'Liu, Liqin', 'Liang, Lingming', 'Xia, Zhen', 'Li, Zhihong', 'Wang, Xianghong', 'McGee, Lawrence R', 'Newhall, Katie', 'Sinclair, Angus', 'Kamb, Alexander', 'Wickramasinghe, Dineli', 'Dai, Kang']","['Li C', 'Liu L', 'Liang L', 'Xia Z', 'Li Z', 'Wang X', 'McGee LR', 'Newhall K', 'Sinclair A', 'Kamb A', 'Wickramasinghe D', 'Dai K']","['Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California. congl@amgen.com.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Amgen Discovery Research, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141208,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,,,2014/12/10 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-14-0388 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0388 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2015 Feb;14(2):375-83. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0388.

The epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of viral respiratory tract infections (vRTI) are not well described in patients with multiple myeloma managed with novel agents, the current standard of care. METHODS: Patients with myeloma from 2009 to 2012 who tested positive on respiratory virus multiplex polymerase chain reaction had clinical, radiological and microbiological records reviewed. The Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) definitions of RTI were applied. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis of risk factors was performed using vRTI as the evaluable outcome. RESULTS: Of 330 patients, 75 (22.7%) tested positive for a total of 100 vRTI episodes. All patients received thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib in combination with myeloma therapies (median of three treatment regimens). vRTI occurred most commonly in patients with progressive disease, and receipt of more than three lines of myeloma therapy was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (p < 0.01). Amongst key respiratory pathogens, influenza was associated with the highest hospital admission rate (66.7%), ICU admission rate (41.6%) and mortality (33.3%) whilst RSV was associated with prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Patients with multiple myeloma and advanced disease managed with multiple lines of therapy are at risk for vRTI, and targeted interventions for prevention/treatment are required.","['Teh, Benjamin W', 'Worth, Leon J', 'Harrison, Simon J', 'Thursky, Karin A', 'Slavin, Monica A']","['Teh BW', 'Worth LJ', 'Harrison SJ', 'Thursky KA', 'Slavin MA']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, ben.teh@petermac.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141210,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,PMC7087950,,,2014/12/10 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2550-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 Jul;23(7):1901-6. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2550-3.

We conducted a retrospective study on newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients who presented at our institution from November 1999 to May 2005. Descriptive statistics and cross-tabulation were used to describe patient characteristics. Measures of morbidity were used to address VTE risk. Chi-square testing, Fisher's exact testing, Mann-Whitney analyses, or median testing were used to determine between-group differences. Data analyses were conducted using Stata version 11 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Two hundred and ninety-nine patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 996 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were included. After excluding patients diagnosed with VTE prior to or at the time of leukemia diagnosis, during the mean time follow-up period of 2.5 years (range: 0.0025-10.3 years), the overall incidence rate of VTE was 3.7 per 100 person-years: 4.2 per 100 person-years for ALL and 3.4 per 100 person-years for AML. Among all patients, the majority (80.6%) developed VTE within 12 months after diagnosis and during thrombocytopenia. The most common VTE was central venous catheter (CVC)-associated upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis. Pulmonary embolism occurred in 15% of ALL patients and 8% of AML patients. VTE recurred in 20.7% of ALL patients and 18.6% of AML patients. VTE occurs frequently in patients with acute leukemia. Studies are needed to identify risk factors for the development and recurrence of VTE among patients with acute leukemia and to establish more effective methods for preventing and treating VTEs in leukemia patients who have thrombocytopenia and/or CVC.","['Vu, Khanh', 'Luong, Nhiem V', 'Hubbard, Julie', 'Zalpour, Ali', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Yang, Daisy', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Kroll, Michael H']","['Vu K', 'Luong NV', 'Hubbard J', 'Zalpour A', 'Faderl S', 'Thomas DA', 'Yang D', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kroll MH']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC4312115,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'anticoagulation', 'cancer', 'thrombosis', 'venous thromboembolism']",2014/12/10 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.332 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2015 Jan;4(1):27-35. doi: 10.1002/cam4.332.

There are several features that distinguish t-AML from de novo AML, including a higher incidence of TP53 mutations, abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, complex cytogenetics and a reduced response to chemotherapy. However, it is not clear how prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy influences leukaemogenesis. In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 mutations are selectively enriched in t-AML/t-MDS is unknown. Here, by sequencing the genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that the total number of somatic single-nucleotide variants and the percentage of chemotherapy-related transversions are similar in t-AML and de novo AML, indicating that previous chemotherapy does not induce genome-wide DNA damage. We identified four cases of t-AML/t-MDS in which the exact TP53 mutation found at diagnosis was also present at low frequencies (0.003-0.7%) in mobilized blood leukocytes or bone marrow 3-6 years before the development of t-AML/t-MDS, including two cases in which the relevant TP53 mutation was detected before any chemotherapy. Moreover, functional TP53 mutations were identified in small populations of peripheral blood cells of healthy chemotherapy-naive elderly individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow chimaeras containing both wild-type and Tp53(+/-) haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), the Tp53(+/-) HSPCs preferentially expanded after exposure to chemotherapy. These data suggest that cytotoxic therapy does not directly induce TP53 mutations. Rather, they support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying age-related TP53 mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand preferentially after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent cytogenetic abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that are typical of patients with t-AML/t-MDS.","['Wong, Terrence N', 'Ramsingh, Giridharan', 'Young, Andrew L', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Touma, Waseem', 'Welch, John S', 'Lamprecht, Tamara L', 'Shen, Dong', 'Hundal, Jasreet', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Heath, Sharon', 'Baty, Jack D', 'Klco, Jeffery M', 'Ding, Li', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Druley, Todd', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Wilson, Richard K']","['Wong TN', 'Ramsingh G', 'Young AL', 'Miller CA', 'Touma W', 'Welch JS', 'Lamprecht TL', 'Shen D', 'Hundal J', 'Fulton RS', 'Heath S', 'Baty JD', 'Klco JM', 'Ding L', 'Mardis ER', 'Westervelt P', 'DiPersio JF', 'Walter MJ', 'Graubert TA', 'Ley TJ', 'Druley T', 'Link DC', 'Wilson RK']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Astra Zeneca, Gaithersburg, MD.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University, St Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Genetics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Genetics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,PMC4403236,,,2014/12/10 06:00,2015/04/16 06:00,['2014/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/nature13968 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 2015 Feb 26;518(7540):552-555. doi: 10.1038/nature13968.

Children and adolescents with refractory/relapsed ALL continue to have a dismal prognosis with hematopoietic stem cell transplant being their most viable option for cure. There is an obvious need for the development of novel agents to further enhance overall outcomes. In this review we focus on the development of humoral and cellular immunotherapeutic agents in the treatment of childhood, adolescent, and young adult ALL. Immunotherapy in various forms has shown immense promise. To date we have seen numerous safety studies using monoclonal antibody therapy, antibody conjugates, bispecific T cell and bispecific natural killer (NK) cell antibodies and genetically reengineered T and NK cells expressing targeted chimeric antigen receptors. Initial success has been found with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies followed by promising results using anti-CD22 and anti-CD19 therapies alone or in combination. Genetic modification of T and NK cells to express targeted chimeric antigen receptors offers a novel immunotherapy option that demonstrates enhanced cytotoxicity in otherwise resistant tumor cells. There is great potential to combine immunotherapies to further improve overall cure rates in children, adolescents, and young adults with poor-risk ALL. A number of humoral and cellular immunotherapy strategies have been investigated and found to be effective, safe, and well tolerated.

Because of the primary dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan, it is necessary to identify other agents that can work synergistically with topotecan, potentially increasing its efficacy while limiting its toxicity. Many studies showed synergism in combination of topotecan with gemcitabine and bortezomib. Other studies report the increase in growth inhibition of gemcitabine or oxaliplatin when cells were preexposed to naturally occurring drugs such as thymoquinone. The aim of this project was to study the mode of action of topotecan along with thymoquinone, on survival and apoptosis pathways in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines, and to investigate the potential synergistic effect of thymoquinone on topotecan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U937 cells were incubated with different topotecan and thymoquinone concentrations for 24 and 48 hours, separately and in combination. Cell proliferation was determined using WST-1 (Roche) reagent. The effect of the compounds on protein expression of Bax, Bcl2, p53, caspase-9, -8, and -3 was determined using Western blot analysis. Cell cycle analysis was performed in addition to annexin/propidium iodide staining. RESULTS: Thymoquinone and topotecan exhibited antiproliferative effects on U937 cells when applied separately. In combination, the reduction in proliferation was extremely significant with a major increase in the expression levels of Bax/Bcl2, p53, and caspase-3 and -9. Preexposure with thymoquinone resulted in an increase in cell growth inhibition compared with topotecan treatment. CONCLUSION: Thymoquinone, when combined with topotecan in noncytotoxic doses, produced synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in AML cells. Preexposure to thymoquinone seems to be more effective than simultaneous application with topotecan.","['Khalife, Rana', 'El-Hayek, Stephany', 'Tarras, Omayr', 'Hodroj, Mohammad Hassan', 'Rizk, Sandra']","['Khalife R', 'El-Hayek S', 'Tarras O', 'Hodroj MH', 'Rizk S']","['Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.

Hepatosplenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, constitutional symptoms, and cytopenias are the main manifestations. The natural history is highly variable, and up to 30% of patients can experience acceleration to acute myelogenous leukemia. Conventional therapy is only palliative and not always effective. However, huge advances have been achieved in the past 2 decades toward a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, as well as improved management. Powerful risk stratification systems are now available and can reliably separate the patients into different prognostic categories to aid clinical management. Allogeneic stem cell transplant can offer cure but is still not universally applicable owing to the treatment-related mortality and toxicity. Nevertheless, outcomes of transplant are improving, owing to the introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens and the optimization of remission monitoring techniques and relapse prevention strategies. The discovery of the V617F mutation of JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and some other molecular aberrations has shed more light on the molecular pathogenesis of the disease and has led to the introduction of novel therapies such as JAK2 inhibitors. In fact, JAK inhibitors have shown promising symptomatic efficacy, and the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib has also shown a potential survival benefit. Future effort should be made to combine allogeneic stem cell transplant with JAK inhibition.","['Alchalby, Haefaa', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Alchalby H', 'Kroger N']","['University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.

Classical Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL)-negative neoplasms include 3 main disorders: essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Genomic studies have shown that these disorders are more heterogeneous than previously thought with 3 main entities corresponding to different gene mutations: the JAK2 disorder, essentially due to JAK2V617F mutation, which includes nearly all PVs and a majority of ETs and PMFs with a continuum between these diseases and the myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) and calreticulin (CALR) disorders, which include a fraction of ET and PMF. All of these mutations lead to a JAK2 constitutive activation. Murine models either with JAK2V617F or MPLW515L, but also with JAK2 or MPL germ line mutations found in hereditary thrombocytosis, have demonstrated that they are drivers of myeloproliferation. However, the myeloproliferative driver mutation is still unknown in approximately 15% of ET and PMF, but appears to also target the JAK/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway. However, other mutations in genes involved in epigenetics or splicing also can be present and can predate or follow mutations in signaling. They are involved either in clonal dominance or in phenotypic changes, more particularly in PMF. They can be associated with leukemic progression and might have an important prognostic value such as additional sex comb-like 1 mutations. Despite this heterogeneity, it is tempting to target JAK2 and its signaling for therapy. However in PMF, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP)-competitive JAK2 inhibitors have shown their interest, but also their important limitations. Thus, other approaches are required, which are discussed in this review.","['Pasquier, Florence', 'Cabagnols, Xenia', 'Secardin, Lise', 'Plo, Isabelle', 'Vainchenker, William']","['Pasquier F', 'Cabagnols X', 'Secardin L', 'Plo I', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM 1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris XI, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM 1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris XI, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM 1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris XI, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM 1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris XI, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM 1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Universite Paris XI, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Villejuif, France.

However, little is known about the molecular alterations of IDH genes in preleukemic disorders with a propensity to transform to AML. We performed polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) followed by direct sequencing to detect IDH mutations in 237 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs; n=108), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n=22), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH; n=41), and aplastic anemia (AA; n=66). No IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutations were identified in the entire cohort, whereas IDH1 G105G allele was detected in 4/108 MPN (3.70%), 2/22 MDS (9.09%), and 2/41 PNH (4.88%) patients. Three IDH2 R140Q mutations were found in 2/108 MPN (1.85%) and 1/22 MDS (4.54%) patients, while one IDH2 G145G allele was found in 0.92% (1/108) of MPN patients. Overall, our data suggest that IDH mutations are rare in the preleukemic disorders and may not be the major initial step in AML leukemogenesis.","['Chotirat, Sadudee', 'Thongnoppakhun, Wanna', 'Wanachiwanawin, Wanchai', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Chotirat S', 'Thongnoppakhun W', 'Wanachiwanawin W', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.

METHODS: MiR-143 expression in rat early pregnancy was detected by Northern blot. The relation between miR-143 and Lifr predicted and confirmed by bioinformatics method, dual-luciferase activity assay, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The role of miR-143 was detected by MTS, Edu and ranswell chamber assays. RESULTS: The expression level of miR-143 on gestation day 5-8 (g.d. 5-8) was higher than on g.d. 3-4 in uteri of pregnant rat. MiR-143 was mainly localized in the superficial stroma/primary decidual zone, luminal and glandular epithelia. The expression of miR-143 was not significantly influenced by pseudopregnancy, but the activation of delayed implantation and experimentally induced decidualization significantly promoted miR-143 expression. Over-expression of miR-143 in human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Knockdown of miR-143 promoted cell proliferation and invasion. The results of recombinant luciferase reporters showed that miR-143 could bind to the 3 cent-untranslated region (UTR) of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (Lifr) to inhibit Lifr translation. CONCLUSIONS: Uterine miR-143 may be involved in the successful pregnancy, especially during the process of blastocyst implantation through regulating Lifr. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study may have the potential to provide new insights into the understanding of miR-143 function during embryo implantation.","['Tian, Shi', 'Su, Xing', 'Qi, Lu', 'Jin, Xiao-Hua', 'Hu, Yi', 'Wang, Chun-Ling', 'Ma, Xu', 'Xia, Hong-Fei']","['Tian S', 'Su X', 'Qi L', 'Jin XH', 'Hu Y', 'Wang CL', 'Ma X', 'Xia HF']","['Haidian Maternal & Child Health Hospital, Beijing 100080, China.', 'Reproductive and Genetic Center of National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing 100081, China; Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Reproductive and Genetic Center of National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing 100081, China.', 'Reproductive and Genetic Center of National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing 100081, China; Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Reproductive and Genetic Center of National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing 100081, China.', 'Cadre Ward, China Mei-Tan General Hospital, Beijing 100028, China.

In Ph(+)ALL, a xenograft assay recently determined that LPCs are enriched in the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD58(-) fraction. Therefore, the prognostic significance of LPCs in Ph(+)ALL subjects after allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT) was investigated. A total of 80 consecutive adults with Ph(+)ALL who underwent allo-HSCT were eligible. A multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis examining CD58-FITC/CD10-PE/ CD19-APC-Cy7/CD34-PerCP/CD45-Vioblue/ CD38-APC on gated leukemia BM blasts was performed at diagnosis. Based on the original blast phenotypes, subjects were stratified into the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD58(-)group (N=15) and other phenotype group (N=65). During minimal residual disease monitoring, significantly higher levels of BCR/ABL transcripts were detected in subjects in the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD58(-) group than in other phenotype group, especially at 3 months post HSCT. In addition, CD34(+)CD38(-)CD58(-)LPCs are directly correlated with a higher 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and worse leukemia-free survival (LFS) and OS. Multivariate analyses indicated that presence of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD58(-) LPCs at diagnosis, and BCR-ABL reduction at 3 months post HSCT were independent risk factors for relapse, LFS and OS. Our data suggest that presence of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD58(-) LPCs at diagnosis allows rapid identification of high-risk patients for relapse after allo-HSCT.","['Kong, Y', 'Xu, L-P', 'Liu, Y-R', 'Qin, Y-Z', 'Sun, Y-Q', 'Wang, Y', 'Jiang, H', 'Jiang, Q', 'Chen, H', 'Chang, Y-J', 'Huang, X-J']","['Kong Y', 'Xu LP', 'Liu YR', 'Qin YZ', 'Sun YQ', 'Wang Y', 'Jiang H', 'Jiang Q', 'Chen H', 'Chang YJ', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""1] Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China [2] Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,,2014/12/09 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2014274 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2014.274 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 Mar;50(3):348-53. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2014.274.

Its expression is lost during the progression of several types of cancer, including lung cancer. The EGF receptor (EGFR), a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase, transduces intracellular signals responsible for cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. EGFR activity is frequently abnormally upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) and thus is considered to be a driving oncogene for LAC. EGFR translocates into the nucleus and transcriptionally activates genes, such as CCND1, that promote cell growth. Recently, we demonstrated that PML interacted with nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) and suppressed the nEGFR-mediated transcriptional activation of CCND1 in lung cancer cells, thereby restraining cell growth. When we further investigated the interplay between PML and EGFR in lung cancer metastasis, we found that the matrix metalloprotease-2 gene (MMP2) was a novel nEGFR target gene and was repressed by PML. We provide evidence that nEGFR bound to the AT-rich sequence (ATRS) in the MMP2 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional activity. In addition, we demonstrated that PML repressed nEGFR-induced MMP2 transcription and reduced cell invasion. PML was recruited by nEGFR to the MMP2 promoter where it reduced histone acetylation, leading to the transcriptional repression of MMP2. Finally, we demonstrated that PML upregulation by interferon-beta (IFNbeta) in lung cancer cells decreased MMP2 expression and cell invasion. Together, our results suggested that IFNbeta induced PML to inhibit lung cancer metastasis by repressing the nEGFR-mediated transcriptional activation of MMP2.","['Kuo, Hong-Yi', 'Huang, Yen-Sung', 'Tseng, Chin-Hsiu', 'Chen, Yi-Chen', 'Chang, Yu-Wei', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming', 'Wu, Cheng-Wen']","['Kuo HY', 'Huang YS', 'Tseng CH', 'Chen YC', 'Chang YW', 'Shih HM', 'Wu CW']","['a Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ; National Yang Ming University ; Taipei , Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC4614437,['NOTNLM'],"['ATRS', 'ATRS, AT-rich sequence', 'EGFR, EGF receptor', 'IFNbeta, interferon-beta', 'INM, inner nuclear membrane', 'Interferon-beta', 'LAC, lung adenocarcinoma', 'MMP2', 'MMP2, matrix metalloprotease-2', 'PML', 'PML, promyelocytic leukemia protein', 'STAT3', 'lung adenocarcinoma', 'nEGFR, nuclear EGFR', 'nuclear EGFR']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.949212 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(19):3132-42. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.949212.,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']","['0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deficiency of ATM predisposes humans and mice to alphabeta T lymphoid cancers with clonal translocations between the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha/delta locus and a 450 kb region of synteny on human chromosome 14 and mouse chromosome 12. While these translocations target and activate the TCL1 oncogene at 14q32 to cause T cell pro-lymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), the TCRalpha/delta;14q32 translocations in ATM-deficient T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have not been characterized and their role in cancer pathogenesis remains unknown. The corresponding lesion in Atm-deficient mouse T-ALLs is a chromosome t(12;14) translocation with Tcrdelta genes fused to sequences on chromosome 12; although these translocations do not activate Tcl1, they delete the Bcl11b haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. To assess whether Tcrdelta translocations that inactivate one copy of Bcl11b promote transformation of Atm-deficient cells, we analyzed Atm(-/-) mice with mono-allelic Bcl11b deletion initiating in thymocytes concomitant with Tcrdelta recombination. Inactivation of one Bcl11b copy had no effect on the predisposition of Atm(-/-) mice to clonal T-ALLs. Yet, none of these T-ALLs had a clonal chromosome t(12;14) translocation that deleted Bcl11b indicating that Tcrdelta translocations that inactivate a copy of Bcl11b promote transformation of Atm-deficient thymocytes. Our data demonstrate that antigen receptor locus translocations can cause cancer by deleting a tumor suppressor gene. We discuss the implications of these findings for the etiology and therapy of T-ALLs associated with ATM deficiency and TCRalpha/delta translocations targeting the 14q32 cytogenetic region.","['Ehrlich, Lori A', 'Yang-Iott, Katherine', 'Bassing, Craig H']","['Ehrlich LA', 'Yang-Iott K', 'Bassing CH']","[""a Division of Oncology; Department of Pediatrics; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia ; Philadelphia , PA USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC4615123,['NOTNLM'],"['A-T, Ataxia Telangiectasia, Ea, TCRa transcriptional enhancer', 'ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'ATM', 'ATM, Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated', 'BCL11B', 'DSB, DNA double strand break', 'SKY, spectral karyotyping', 'T-ALL', 'T-ALL, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'TCR, T cell receptor', 'thymocytes', 'transformation', 'translocations']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.949144 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(19):3076-82. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.949144.,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']","['0 (Bcl11b protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)']",,,"['R01 CA125195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA009615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we provide an overview of our current understanding of FANCD2 and FANCI, with an emphasis on their posttranslational modification and common and unique functions.","['Boisvert, Rebecca A', 'Howlett, Niall G']","['Boisvert RA', 'Howlett NG']","['a Department of Cell and Molecular Biology ; University of Rhode Island ; Kingston , RI USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC4612647,['NOTNLM'],"['AML , acute myeloid leukemia', 'APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome', 'APH, aphidicolin', 'ARM, armadillo repeat domain', 'AT, ataxia-telangiectasia', 'ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated', 'ATR, ATM and Rad3-related', 'BAC, bacterial-artificial-chromosome', 'BS, Bloom syndrome', 'CUE, coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endoplasmic reticulum degradation', 'ChIP-seq, CHIP sequencing', 'CtBP, C-terminal binding protein', 'CtIP, CtBP-interacting protein', 'DNA interstrand crosslink repair', 'DNA repair', 'EPS15, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15', 'FA, Fanconi anemia', 'FAN1, FANCD2-associated nuclease1', 'FANCD2', 'FANCI', 'FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'Fanconi anemia', 'HECT, homologous to E6-AP Carboxy Terminus', 'HJ, Holliday junction', 'HR, homologous recombination', 'MCM2-MCM7, minichromosome maintenance 2-7', 'MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts', 'MMC, mitomycin C', 'MRN, MRE11/RAD50/NBS1', 'NLS, nuclear localization signal', 'PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen', 'PIKK, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-kinase-like family of protein kinases', 'PIP-box, PCNA-interacting protein motif', 'POL kappa, DNA polymerase kappa', 'RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends', 'RING, really interesting new gene', 'RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase', 'SCF, Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein complex', 'SCKL1, seckel syndrome', 'SILAC, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture', 'SLD1/SLD2, SUMO-like domains', 'SLIM, SUMO-like domain interacting motif', 'TIP60, 60 kDa Tat-interactive protein', 'TLS, Translesion DNA synthesis', 'UAF1, USP1-associated factor 1', 'UBD, ubiquitin-binding domain', 'UBZ, ubiquitin-binding zinc finger', 'UFB, ultra-fine DNA bridges', 'UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif', 'ULD, ubiquitin-like domain', 'USP1, ubiquitin-specific protease 1', 'VRR-nuc, virus-type replication repair nuclease', 'iPOND, isolation of proteins on nascent DNA', 'ubiquitin']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.956475 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(19):2999-3015. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.956475.,,IM,"['DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'Fanconi Anemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']","['0 (FANCI protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['R01 HL101977/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, mutational signatures of APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases were identified in many common cancers, suggesting off-target deamination of cytosine to uracil as a common mutagenic mechanism. Here we present evidence from mass spectrometric quantitation of deoxyuridine in DNA that shows significantly higher genomic uracil content in B-cell lymphoma cell lines compared to non-lymphoma cancer cell lines and normal circulating lymphocytes. The genomic uracil levels were highly correlated with AID mRNA and protein expression, but not with expression of other APOBECs. Accordingly, AID knockdown significantly reduced genomic uracil content. B-cells stimulated to express endogenous AID and undergo class switch recombination displayed a several-fold increase in total genomic uracil, indicating that B cells may undergo widespread cytosine deamination after stimulation. In line with this, we found that clustered mutations (kataegis) in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia predominantly carry AID-hotspot mutational signatures. Moreover, we observed an inverse correlation of genomic uracil with uracil excision activity and expression of the uracil-DNA glycosylases UNG and SMUG1. In conclusion, AID-induced mutagenic U:G mismatches in DNA may be a fundamental and common cause of mutations in B-cell malignancies.","['Pettersen, Henrik Sahlin', 'Galashevskaya, Anastasia', 'Doseth, Berit', 'Sousa, Mirta M L', 'Sarno, Antonio', 'Visnes, Torkild', 'Aas, Per Arne', 'Liabakk, Nina-Beate', 'Slupphaug, Geir', 'Saetrom, Pal', 'Kavli, Bodil', 'Krokan, Hans E']","['Pettersen HS', 'Galashevskaya A', 'Doseth B', 'Sousa MM', 'Sarno A', 'Visnes T', 'Aas PA', 'Liabakk NB', 'Slupphaug G', 'Saetrom P', 'Kavli B', 'Krokan HE']","[""Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Liaison Committee between the Central Norway Regional Health Authority (RHA) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway; St. Olav's Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, NO-7006 Trondheim, Norway."", 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility (PROMEC) at NTNU, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; The Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Facility (PROMEC) at NTNU, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.

DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters, and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefit inpatient databases from the years 2007-2011 were obtained. Utilizing ICD-9 codes, logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors/comorbidities for developing endophthalmitis in patients with hematogenous infections. RESULTS: Among inpatients with hematogenous infections, the overall incidence rate of presumed endogenous endophthalmitis was 0.05%-0.4% among patients with fungemia and 0.04% among patients with bacteremia. Comorbid human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (OR = 4.27; CI, 1.55-11.8; P = .005), tuberculosis (OR = 8.5; CI, 1.2-61.5; P = .03), endocarditis (OR = 8.3; CI, 4.9-13.9; P < .0001), bacterial meningitis (OR = 3.8; CI, 1.2-12.0; P = .023), fungal meningitis (OR = 59.1; CI, 14.1-247.8; P < .0001), internal organ abscess (OR = 2.9; CI, 1.2-6.4; P = .02), lymphoma/leukemia (OR = 2.9; CI, 1.6-5.3; P < .0001), skin abscess/cellulitis (OR = 1.75; CI, 1.1-2.8; P = .02), pyogenic arthritis (OR = 4.2; CI, 1.8-9.6; P = .001), diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations (OR = 7.0; CI, 1.7-28.3; P = .006), and urinary tract infection (OR = 0.04; CI, 0.3-0.9; P = .023) were each significantly associated with a diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis. Patients aged 0-17 years (OR = 2.61; CI, 1.2-5.7; P = .02), 45-54 years (OR = 3.4; CI, 2.0-5.4; P < .0001), and 55-64 years (OR = 2.9; CI, 1.8-4.8; P < .0001); those having length of stay of 3-10 days (OR = 1.9; CI, 1.1-3.3; P = .01), 11-30 days (OR = 3.1; CI, 1.8-5.5; P < .0001), and 31+ days (OR = 5.3; CI, 2.7-10.4; P < .0001); and those with intensive care unit/neonatal intensive care unit (ICU/NICU) admissions (OR = 1.5; CI, 1.4-1.6; P < .0001) were all more likely to be diagnosed with endogenous endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous endophthalmitis is rare among hospitalized patients in the United States. Among patients with hematogenous infections, odds of endogenous endophthalmitis were higher for children and middle-aged patients, and for patients with endocarditis, bacterial meningitis, lymphoma/leukemia, HIV/AIDS, internal organ abscess, diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations, skin cellulitis/abscess, pyogenic arthritis, tuberculosis, longer hospital stays, and/or ICU/NICU admission.","['Vaziri, Kamyar', 'Pershing, Suzann', 'Albini, Thomas A', 'Moshfeghi, Darius M', 'Moshfeghi, Andrew A']","['Vaziri K', 'Pershing S', 'Albini TA', 'Moshfeghi DM', 'Moshfeghi AA']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California; Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, Calfornia.

In this investigation, we successfully established two relatively synchronous polyploid cell models by inducing Dami and CMK cells with SP600125. We found that SP600125 induced the polyploidization of Dami and CMK cells, concomitant with the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) at Thr421/Ser424 and dephosphorylation at Thr389. The polyploidization was partially blocked by H-89, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor, through direct binding to S6K1, leading to dephosphorylation at Thr421/Ser424 and phosphorylation at Thr389, independent of PKA. Overexpression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of S6K1 further enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on the SP600125-induced polyploidization of Dami and CMK cells. SP600125 also induced the polyploidization of Meg-01 cells, which are derived from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia, without causing a significant change in S6K1 phosphorylation. Additionally, SP600125 induced the polyploidization of HEL cells, which are derived from a patient with erythroleukemia, and phosphorylation at Thr389 of S6K1 was detected. However, the polyploidization of both Meg-01 cells and HEL cells as a result of SP600125 treatment was lower than that of SP600125-induced Dami and CMK cells, and it was not blocked by H-89 despite the increased phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389 in both cell lines in response to H-89. Given that the Dami and CMK cell lines were derived from patients with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) and expressed high levels of platelet-specific antigens, our data suggested that SP600125-induced polyploidization is cell-type specific, that these cell lines were more differentiated, and that phosphorylation at Thr421/Ser424 and dephosphorylation at Thr389 of S6K1 may play an important role in the SP600125-induced polyploidization of these cell lines synergistically with other signaling pathways.","['Li, Chang-Ling', 'Yang, Jin-Gang', 'Lin, Di', 'Zhao, Yong-Shan', 'Liu, Shuo', 'Xing, Si-Ning', 'Zhao, Song', 'Chen, Cong-Qin', 'Jiang, Zhi-Ming', 'Pu, Fei-Fei', 'Cao, Jian-Ping', 'Ma, Dong-Chu']","['Li CL', 'Yang JG', 'Lin D', 'Zhao YS', 'Liu S', 'Xing SN', 'Zhao S', 'Chen CQ', 'Jiang ZM', 'Pu FF', 'Cao JP', 'Ma DC']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'School of Life Science and Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Clinical Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenhe District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC4259319,,,2014/12/09 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2013/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0114389 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-19471 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Dec 8;9(12):e114389. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0114389. eCollection 2014.,,IM,"['Anthracenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']","['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kD, polypeptide 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous results from our laboratory have shown that EVI1 influenced transcription regulation in response to the myeloid differentiation inducing agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in a dual manner: it enhanced ATRA induced transcription of the RARbeta gene, but repressed the ATRA induction of the EVI1 gene itself. In the present study, we asked whether EVI1 would modulate the ATRA regulation of a larger number of genes, as well as biological responses to this agent, in human myeloid cells. U937 and HL-60 cells ectopically expressing EVI1 through retroviral transduction were subjected to microarray based gene expression analysis, and to assays measuring cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These experiments showed that EVI1 modulated the ATRA response of several dozens of genes, and in fact reinforced it in the vast majority of cases. A particularly strong synergy between EVI1 and ATRA was observed for GDF15, which codes for a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of cytokines. In line with the gene expression results, EVI1 enhanced cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to ATRA, and knockdown of GDF15 counteracted some of these effects.

Genetic ablation of STIL, an essential component of the centriole replication machinery in mammalian cells, causes embryonic lethality in mice around mid gestation associated with defective Hedgehog signaling. Here, we describe, by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, that STIL(-/-) mouse embryos do not contain centrioles or primary cilia, suggesting that these organelles are not essential for mammalian development until mid gestation.

In spite of their apparent homogeneity, pB-ALL comprises a group of diseases very different both clinically and pathologically, and with very diverse outcomes as a consequence of their biology, and underlying molecular alterations. Their understanding (as a prerequisite for their cure) will require a sustained multidisciplinary effort from professionals coming from many different fields. Among all the available tools for pB-ALL research, the use of animal models stands, as of today, as the most powerful approach, not only for the understanding of the origin and evolution of the disease, but also for the development of new therapies. In this review we go over the most relevant (historically, technically or biologically) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of human pB-ALLs that have been generated over the last 20 years. Our final aim is to outline the most relevant guidelines that should be followed to generate an ""ideal"" animal model that could become a standard for the study of human pB-ALL leukemia, and which could be shared among research groups and drug development companies in order to unify criteria for studies like drug testing, analysis of the influence of environmental risk factors, or studying the role of both low-penetrance mutations and cancer susceptibility alterations.","['Hauer, Julia', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Cobaleda, Cesar']","['Hauer J', 'Borkhardt A', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Cobaleda C']","['a Department of Pediatric Oncology ; Hematology and Clinical Immunology ; Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf ; Medical Faculty ; Dusseldorf , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC4613455,['NOTNLM'],"['B-precursor leukemia', 'BCR-ABL', 'CLP, common lymphoid progenitor', 'GEMM, genetically engineered mouse model', 'LIC, leukemia-initiating cell', 'MLL', 'ROS, reactive oxygen species.', 'TEL-AML1', 'mouse models', 'pB-ALL', 'pB-ALL, preB-Acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/08/21 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.949137 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(18):2836-46. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.949137.,,IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,,['R01 CA109335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their roles in hematological malignancies are largely unknown. Recent findings demonstrate that PRL2 is important for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. In addition, both PRL2 and PRL3 are highly expressed in some hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Moreover, PRL deficiency impairs the proliferation and survival of leukemia cells through regulating oncogenic signaling pathways. While PRLs are potential novel therapeutic targets in hematological malignancies, their exact biological function and cellular substrates remain unclear. This review will discuss how PRLs regulate hematopoietic stem cell behavior, what signaling pathways are regulated by PRLs, and how to target PRLs in hematological malignancies. An improved understanding of how PRLs function and how they are regulated may facilitate the development of PRL inhibitors that are effective in cancer treatment.","['Kobayashi, Michihiro', 'Chen, Sisi', 'Gao, Rui', 'Bai, Yunpeng', 'Zhang, Zhong-Yin', 'Liu, Yan']","['Kobayashi M', 'Chen S', 'Gao R', 'Bai Y', 'Zhang ZY', 'Liu Y']","['a Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Indiana University School of Medicine ; Indianapolis , IN USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC4614371,['NOTNLM'],"['PRL', 'PTP4A', 'hematological malignancy and therapeutic target', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'oncogenic signaling', 'self-renewal']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/08/21 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.954448 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(18):2827-35. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.954448.,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', '*Liver Regeneration', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)'],,,"['R01 CA069202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA120373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA69202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fucci system incorporates genetically encoded probes that highlight G1 and S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle allowing live imaging. However the available mouse models that incorporate Fucci are beset by problems with transgene inactivation, varying expression level, lack of conditional potential and/or the need to maintain separate transgenes-there is no transgenic mouse model that solves all these problems. To address these shortfalls we re-engineered the Fucci system to create 2 bicistronic Fucci variants incorporating both probes fused using the Thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A) self cleaving peptide. We characterize these variants in stable 3T3 cell lines. One of the variants (termed Fucci2a) faithfully recapitulated the nuclear localization and cell cycle stage specific florescence of the original Fucci system. We go on to develop a conditional mouse allele (R26Fucci2aR) carefully designed for high, inducible, ubiquitous expression allowing investigation of cell cycle status in single cell lineages within the developing embryo. We demonstrate the utility of R26Fucci2aR for live imaging by using high resolution confocal microscopy of ex vivo lung, kidney and neural crest development. Using our 3T3 system we describe and validate a method to estimate cell cycle times from relatively short time-lapse sequences that we then apply to our neural crest data.

We here revisited ID in subset #4 CLL to reconstruct their evolutionary history as a community of related clones. To this end, using specialized bioinformatics tools we assessed both IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ rearrangements (n = 511) and IGKV-IGKJ rearrangements (n = 397) derived from eight subset #4 cases. Due to high sequence relatedness, a number of subclonal clusters from different cases lay very close to one another, forming a core from which clusters exhibiting greater variation stemmed. Minor subclones from individual cases were mutated to such an extent that they now resembled the sequences of another patient. Viewing the entire subset #4 data set as a single entity branching through diversification enabled inference of a common sequence representing the putative ancestral BcR IG expressed by their still elusive common progenitor.

Small molecules that inhibit the protein-protein interactions between prosurvival and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (so-called ""BH3 mimetics"") have a potential therapeutic value, as indicated by clinical findings obtained with ABT-263 (navitoclax), a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist, and more recently with GDC-0199/ABT-199, a more selective antagonist of Bcl-2. Here, we report study results of the functional role of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 against a panel of solid cancer cell lines representative of different tumor types. We observed silencing of Mcl-1 expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) significantly reduced viability and induced apoptosis in almost 30% of cell lines tested, including lung and breast adenocarcinoma, as well as glioblastoma derived lines. Most importantly, we provide a mechanistic basis for this sensitivity by showing antagonism of Mcl-1 function with specific BH3 peptides against isolated mitochondria induces Bak oligomerization and cytochrome c release, therefore demonstrating that mitochondria from Mcl-1-sensitive cells depend on Mcl-1 for their integrity and that antagonizing Mcl-1 function is sufficient to induce apoptosis. Thus, our results lend further support for considering Mcl-1 as a therapeutic target in a number of solid cancers and support the rationale for development of small molecule BH3-mimetics antagonists of this protein.","['Modugno, Michele', 'Banfi, Patrizia', 'Gasparri, Fabio', 'Borzilleri, Robert', 'Carter, Percy', 'Cornelius, Lyndon', 'Gottardis, Marco', 'Lee, Ving', 'Mapelli, Claudio', 'Naglich, Joseph G', 'Tebben, Andrew', 'Vite, Gregory', 'Pastori, Wilma', 'Albanese, Clara', 'Corti, Emiliana', 'Ballinari, Dario', 'Galvani, Arturo']","['Modugno M', 'Banfi P', 'Gasparri F', 'Borzilleri R', 'Carter P', 'Cornelius L', 'Gottardis M', 'Lee V', 'Mapelli C', 'Naglich JG', 'Tebben A', 'Vite G', 'Pastori W', 'Albanese C', 'Corti E', 'Ballinari D', 'Galvani A']","['Nerviano Medical Sciences S.r.l. - Oncology, Viale Pasteur 10, I-20014 Nerviano, Milan, Italy.

In addition, these CD71(high) cells went through ""maturational globin switching"" and enucleated during terminal differentiation in vitro that were similar to the yolk sac-derived EryPs in vivo. We further demonstrated that the formation of CD71(high) population was regulated differentially by key factors including Scl, HoxB4, Eaf1, and Klf1.

A subsequent yeast 2-hybrid screen identified LARG; Leukemia-Associated Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (also known as Arhgef12), as a potential novel TELO2 interactor. LARG was previously shown to interact with Pericentrin (PCNT), which, like TELO2, is required for efficient replication stress signaling. Here we confirm interactions between LARG, TELO2 and PCNT and show that a sub-set of LARG co-localizes with PCNT at the centrosome. LARG-deficient cells exhibit replication stress signaling defects as evidenced by; supernumerary centrosomes, reduced replication stress-induced gammaH2AX and RPA nuclear foci formation, and reduced activation of the replication stress signaling effector kinase Chk1 in response to hydroxyurea. As such, LARG-deficient cells are sensitive to replication stress-inducing agents such as hydroxyurea and mitomycin C. Conversely we also show that depletion of TELO2 and the replication stress signaling kinase ATR leads to RhoA signaling defects. These data therefore reveal a level of crosstalk between the RhoA and DDR signaling pathways. Given that mutations in both ATR and PCNT can give rise to the related primordial dwarfism disorders of Seckel Syndrome and Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPDII) respectively, which both exhibit defects in ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, these data also raise the possibility that mutations in LARG or disruption to RhoA signaling may be contributory factors to the etiology of a sub-set of primordial dwarfism disorders.","['Beveridge, Ryan D', 'Staples, Christopher J', 'Patil, Abhijit A', 'Myers, Katie N', 'Maslen, Sarah', 'Skehel, J Mark', 'Boulton, Simon J', 'Collis, Spencer J']","['Beveridge RD', 'Staples CJ', 'Patil AA', 'Myers KN', 'Maslen S', 'Skehel JM', 'Boulton SJ', 'Collis SJ']","['a Genome Stability Group ; Department of Oncology ; Academic Unit of Molecular Oncology ; University of Sheffield Medical School ; Sheffield , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC4615130,['NOTNLM'],"['ATR signalling', 'DDR, DNA damage response', 'DNA damage response', 'HU, hydroxyurea', 'PCNT, pericentrin', 'RhoGEF', 'centrosome', 'replication stress']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.956529 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(21):3450-9. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.956529.,,IM,"['Antigens/metabolism', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Centrosome/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']","['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (pericentrin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,['12102/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,['Cell Cycle. 2014;13(23):3627.

HDM2 is a ubiquitin ligase, which initiates the proteasomal degradation of p53 following ubiquitination. Proteasome inhibitors, by targeting the ubiquitin proteasome pathway inhibit the degradation of the majority of cellular proteins including wild-type p53. In contrast, in this study we found that the protein expression of mutant p53 was suppressed following treatment with established or novel proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, for the first time we demonstrated that Arsenic trioxide, which was previously shown to suppress mutant p53 protein level, exhibits proteasome inhibitory activity. Proteasome inhibitor-mediated suppression of mutant p53 was partially rescued by the knockdown of HDM2, suggesting that the stabilization of HDM2 by proteasome inhibitors might be responsible for mutant p53 suppression to some extent. This study suggests that suppression of mutant p53 is a general property of proteasome inhibitors and it provides additional rationale to use proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of tumors with mutant p53.","['Halasi, Marianna', 'Pandit, Bulbul', 'Gartel, Andrei L']","['Halasi M', 'Pandit B', 'Gartel AL']","['a Department of Medicine ; University of Illinois at Chicago ; Chicago , IL USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC4613555,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide', 'Bax, Bcl-2-associated X', 'Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2', 'FOXM1, Forkhead Box M1, Mcl-1, Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1', 'HDM2', 'HDM2, human double minute 2', 'PUMA, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis', 'RNAi', 'p53', 'proteasome inhibitors']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.950132 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(20):3202-6. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.950132.,,IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']","['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We considered first as a model disease chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is triggered by a well-identified oncogenetic protein (BCR/Abl) and brilliantly treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi). However, TKi are extremely effective in inducing remission of disease, but unable, in most cases, to prevent relapse. We demonstrated that the interference with cell metabolism (oxygen/glucose shortage) enriches cells exhibiting the leukemia stem cell (LSC) phenotype and, at the same time, suppresses BCR/Abl protein expression. These LSC are therefore refractory to the TKi Imatinib-mesylate, pointing to cell metabolism as an important factor controlling the onset of TKi-resistant minimal residual disease (MRD) of CML and the related relapse. Studies of solid neoplasias brought another player into the control of MRD, low tissue pH, which often parallels cancer growth and progression. Thus, a 3-party scenario emerged for the regulation of CSC/LSC maintenance, MRD induction and disease relapse: the ""hypoxic"" versus the ""ischemic"" vs. the ""acidic"" environment.

Several studies showed better outcome in adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with pediatrics protocols than similarly aged patients treated with adults protocols, while other studies showed similar outcome of both protocols. We conducted this study to compare the outcome of our pediatrics and adults therapeutic protocols in treatment of adolescents ALL. Patients and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed files of 86 consecutive adolescent ALL patients aged 15-18 years who attended to outpatients clinic from January 2003 to January 2010. 32 out of 86 were treated with pediatrics adopted BFM 90 high risk protocol while 54 were treated with adults adopted BFM protocol. We analyzed the effect of different treatment protocols on achieving complete remission (CR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Results. The 2 patients groups have almost similar characteristics. The CR was significantly higher in pediatrics protocol 96% versus 89% (P = 0.001). Despite the fact that the toxicity profiles were higher in pediatrics protocol, they were tolerable. Moreover, the pediatrics protocol resulted in superior outcome in EFS 67% versus 39% (P = 0.001), DFS 65% versus 41% (P = 0.000), and OS 67% versus 45% (P = 0.000). Conclusion.

Sammons Cancer Center, 2010 to 2012: retrospective analysis of molecular genetic evaluation.",299-304,,"Over the last several decades, advancements in the understanding of genetic and molecular origins of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have brought about significant changes in how the disease is classified, diagnosed, and treated. The change from the traditional French-American-British classification system to that of the World Health Organization redefined how the disease is diagnosed not only morphologically but genetically. With genetic information proving to have prognostic value, the newer classification system, which incorporates results of cytogenetic and molecular analyses, allows better definition of disease and risk stratification, ultimately guiding treatment choices. As understanding and advancements in the molecular basis of AML continue to grow and influence patient management, the importance of an accurate and thorough initial patient evaluation is paramount. We performed a review of AML cases diagnosed at Baylor Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center from February 2010 to December 2012 to assess the thoroughness of initial diagnostic evaluations based on current guidelines, including up-to-date molecular analyses for mutations in NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3, and C-KIT. Results showed that patients newly diagnosed with AML undergo thorough diagnostic evaluation in keeping with current recommendations, and many had further genetic and molecular evaluations, which although considered optional or investigational, have prognostic significance. We identified potential areas of improvement for making this diagnostic evaluation more specific to the patient and the patient's disease. Currently, we are investigating having patients undergo reflex genetic testing if they meet certain criteria to better define their specific disease while avoiding unnecessary genetic evaluations that come at increased cost.","['Jones, Catherine', 'LeDay, Temekka V', 'Miller, Alan M']","['Jones C', 'LeDay TV', 'Miller AM']","['Department of Oncology, Baylor Charles A.

Furthermore, it plays a significant role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In order to elucidate the influence of DNA methylation during B-cell development, genome-wide DNA methylation status of pro-B, pre-BI, pre-BII, and naive-B-cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood was determined using the methylated CpG island recovery assay followed by next generation sequencing. On average, 182-200 million sequences were generated for each precursor B-cell subset in 10 biological replicates. An overall decrease in methylation was observed during the transition from pro-B to pre-BI, whereas no differential methylation was observed in the pre-BI to pre-BII transition or in the pre-BII to naive B-cell transition. Most of the methylated regions were located within intergenic and intronic regions not present in a CpG island context. Putative novel enhancers were identified in these regions that were differentially methylated between pro-B and pre-BI cells. The genome-wide methylation profiles are publically available and may be used to gain a better understanding of the involvement of atypical DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of malignancies associated with precursor B-cells.","['Almamun, Md', 'Levinson, Benjamin T', 'Gater, Susan T', 'Schnabel, Robert D', 'Arthur, Gerald L', 'Davis, J Wade', 'Taylor, Kristen H']","['Almamun M', 'Levinson BT', 'Gater ST', 'Schnabel RD', 'Arthur GL', 'Davis JW', 'Taylor KH']","['a Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences ; University of Missouri-Columbia ; Columbia , MO USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,PMC4622941,['NOTNLM'],"['CG dinucleotide', 'CLP, common lymphoid progenitor cells', 'CpGI, CpG island', 'DMRs, differentially methylated regions', 'DNA methylation', 'FDR, false discovery rate.', 'H3K27ac, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation', 'H3K4me1, histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation', 'HCB, human umbilical cord blood', 'HSCs, haematopoietic stem cells', 'MBDs, methyl CpG binding domains', 'MIRA-seq, methylated CpG island recovery assay (MIRA) followed by next generation', 'sequencing', 'MeCP2, methyl CpG binding protein 2', 'Pre-B, precursor B-cell; CD', 'Pro-B, progenitor B-cell', 'ROIs, regions of interest', 'TFs, transcription factors', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia; CpG', 'cluster of differentiation; ALL', 'enhancer', 'next-generation sequencing', 'precursor B-cell', 'umbilical cord blood']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/07/25 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15592294.2014.983379 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2014 Dec;9(12):1588-95. doi: 10.4161/15592294.2014.983379.,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*physiology']",,,,['R00 CA132784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been proved that many core autophagy-related molecules participate in this event. However, new component proteins that regulate autophagy are still being discovered. At present, we report PHF23 (PHD finger protein 23) with a PHD-like zinc finger domain that can negatively regulate autophagy. Data from experiments indicated that the overexpression of PHF23 impaired autophagy, as characterized by decreased levels of LC3B-II and weakened degradation of endogenous and exogenous autophagic substrates. Conversely, knockdown of PHF23 resulted in opposite effects. Molecular mechanism studies suggested that PHF23 interacts with LRSAM1, which is an E3 ligase key for ubiquitin-dependent autophagy against invading bacteria. PHF23 promotes the ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of LRSAM1. We also show that the PHD finger of PHF23 is a functional domain needed for the interaction with LRSAM1. Altogether, our results indicate that PHF23 is a negative regulator associated in autophagy via the LRSAM1 signaling pathway. The physical and functional connection between the PHF23 and LRSAM1 needs further investigation.","['Wang, Zhenda', 'Hu, Jia', 'Li, Ge', 'Qu, Liujing', 'He, Qihua', 'Lou, Yaxin', 'Song, Quansheng', 'Ma, Dalong', 'Chen, Yingyu']","['Wang Z', 'Hu J', 'Li G', 'Qu L', 'He Q', 'Lou Y', 'Song Q', 'Ma D', 'Chen Y']","['a Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology; Ministry of Health ; Peking University Health Science Center ; Beijing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,PMC4502667,['NOTNLM'],"['AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'ATG, autophagy-related', 'BafA1, bafilomycin A1', 'CALCOCO2, calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2', 'CQ, chloroquine', ""EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution"", 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'GFP, green fluorescent protein', 'GST, glutathione S-transferase', 'IP, immunoprecipitation', 'LRSAM1', 'LRSAM1, leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif containing 1', 'MAP1LC3B/LC3B', 'PHD domain', 'PHD, plant homeodomain', 'PHF23', 'PHF23, PHD finger protein 23', 'PIK3C3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic subunit type 3', 'SQSTM1, sequestosome 1', 'Three-MA, 3-methyladenine', 'autophagy', 'microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta', 'ubiquitination']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/auto.36439 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2014;10(12):2158-70. doi: 10.4161/auto.36439.,,IM,"['Autophagy/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*physiology']","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PHF23 protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (LRSAM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent discoveries have implicated autophagy in the cellular secretory process, but potential roles of autophagy-mediated secretion in modifying the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. Furthermore, efforts to inhibit autophagy in clinical trials have been hampered by suboptimal methods to quantitatively measure tumor autophagy levels. Here, we leveraged the autophagy-based involvement in cellular secretion to identify shed proteins associated with autophagy levels in melanoma. The secretome of low-autophagy WM793 melanoma cells was compared to its highly autophagic metastatic derivative, 1205Lu in physiological 3-dimensional cell culture using quantitative proteomics. These comparisons identified candidate autophagy biomarkers IL1B (interleukin 1, beta), CXCL8 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8), LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), FAM3C (family with sequence similarity 3, member C), and DKK3 (dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 3) with known roles in inflammation and tumorigenesis, and these proteins were subsequently shown to be elevated in supernatants of an independent panel of high-autophagy melanoma cell lines. Secretion levels of these proteins increased when low-autophagy melanoma cells were treated with the autophagy-inducing tat-BECN1 (Beclin 1) peptide and decreased when ATG7 (autophagy-related 7) was silenced in high-autophagy cells, thereby supporting a mechanistic link between these secreted proteins and autophagy. In addition, serum from metastatic melanoma patients with high tumor autophagy levels exhibited higher levels of these proteins than serum from patients with low-autophagy tumors. These results suggest that autophagy-related secretion affects the tumor microenvironment and measurement of autophagy-associated secreted proteins in plasma and possibly in tumors can serve as surrogates for intracellular autophagy dynamics in tumor cells.","['Kraya, Adam A', 'Piao, Shengfu', 'Xu, Xiaowei', 'Zhang, Gao', 'Herlyn, Meenhard', 'Gimotty, Phyllis', 'Levine, Beth', 'Amaravadi, Ravi K', 'Speicher, David W']","['Kraya AA', 'Piao S', 'Xu X', 'Zhang G', 'Herlyn M', 'Gimotty P', 'Levine B', 'Amaravadi RK', 'Speicher DW']","['a Center for Systems and Computational Biology; The Wistar Institute ; Philadelphia , PA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,PMC4502670,['NOTNLM'],"['ATG5, autophagy-related 5', 'ATG7, autophagy-related 7', 'AV, autophagic vacuole', 'BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy-related', 'CXCL8, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8', 'DKK3, dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 3', 'EGF, epidermal growth factor', 'IF, interstitial fluid', 'IL1B, interleukin 1, beta', 'LC3/MAP1LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3', 'LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor', 'M, media', 'PtdIns3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase', 'SAM, significance analysis of microarrays', 'autophagy', 'biomarker', 'cancer', 'melanoma', 'secretome']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15548627.2014.984273 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2015;11(1):60-74. doi: 10.4161/15548627.2014.984273.,,IM,"['*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/blood/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Spheroids, Cellular/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/metabolism']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']",,,"['P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA114046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA120862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA174523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32HG000046-15/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K23CA120862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously that epratuzumab displayed in vitro cytotoxicity to CD22-expressing Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (Daudi and Ramos) only when immobilized on plates or combined with a crosslinking antibody plus a suboptimal amount of anti-IgM (1 mug/mL). Herein, we show that, in the absence of additional anti-IgM ligation, extensive crosslinking of CD22 by plate-immobilized epratuzumab induced intracellular changes in Daudi cells similar to ligating B-cell antigen receptor with a sufficiently high amount of anti-IgM (10 mug/mL). Specifically, either treatment led to phosphorylation of CD22, CD79a and CD79b, along with their translocation to lipid rafts, both of which were essential for effecting caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, such immobilization induced stabilization of F-actin, phosphorylation of Lyn, ERKs and JNKs, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease in mitochondria membrane potential (Deltapsim), upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl and Mcl-1. The physiological relevance of immobilized epratuzumab was implicated by noting that several of its in vitro effects, including apoptosis, drop in Deltapsim, and generation of ROS, could be observed with soluble epratuzumab in Daudi cells co-cultivated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These results suggest that the in vivo mechanism of non-ligand-blocking epratuzumab may, in part, involve the unmasking of CD22 to facilitate the trans-interaction of B cells with vascular endothelium.","['Chang, Chien-Hsing', 'Wang, Yang', 'Gupta, Pankaj', 'Goldenberg, David M']","['Chang CH', 'Wang Y', 'Gupta P', 'Goldenberg DM']","['a Immunomedics, Inc. ; Morris Plains , NJ USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,PMC4622945,['NOTNLM'],"['488-annexin V, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated annexin V', '7-AAD, 7-aminoactinomycin D, Syk, spleen tyrosine kinase', ""Anti-IgM, F(ab')2 fragment of affinity-purified goat anti-human IgM, Fc5mu"", 'fragment', 'BCR', 'BCR, B-cell antigen receptor', 'BSA, bovine serum albumin', 'CD22', ""CM-H2DCF-DA, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate"", 'DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl', 'EC, endothelial cells', 'ERKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinases', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'FITC-DNase I, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated DNase I', ""GAH, F(ab')2 fragment of affinity-purified goat anti-human IgG Fcgamma"", 'fragment-specific', 'HUV-EC', 'HUV-EC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells', 'ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif', 'JNKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinases', 'JP, jasplakinolide', 'LatB, latrunculin B', 'Lyn, Lck/Yes novel tyrosine kinase', 'MAP kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases', 'MTS, (3-(4,', '5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoli', 'um', 'PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase', 'PBS, phosphate-buffered saline', 'PLCgamma2, phospholipase C, isotype gamma 2', 'ROS, reactive oxygen species', ""Rhodamine-anti-IgG, rhodamine-conjugated F(ab')2 fragment of affinity-purified"", ""goat anti-human IgG, F(ab')2 fragment-specific"", 'TMRE/tetramethylrhodamine/ethyl ester', 'epratuzumab', 'human B-cell lymphoma', 'immobilized', 'mIgM, membrane IgM', 'Deltapsim, mitochondria membrane potential']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/19420862.2014.979081 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2015;7(1):199-211. doi: 10.4161/19420862.2014.979081.,,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Caspases/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Capping/*drug effects', 'Membrane Microdomains/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '3062P60MH9 (epratuzumab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PASylation, the genetic fusion with a long, conformationally disordered amino acid chain comprising Pro, Ala and Ser, provides a convenient way to expand protein size and, consequently, retard renal filtration. Humanized alphaHER2 and alphaCD20 Fabs were systematically fused with 100 to 600 PAS residues and produced in E. coli. Cytofluorimetric titration analysis on tumor cell lines confirmed that antigen-binding activities of the parental antibodies were retained. The radio-iodinated PASylated Fabs were studied by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution analysis in mouse tumor xenograft models. While the unmodified alphaHER2 and alphaCD20 Fabs showed weak tumor uptake (0.8% and 0.2% ID/g, respectively; 24 h p.i.) tumor-associated radioactivity was boosted with increasing PAS length (up to 9 and 26-fold, respectively), approaching an optimum for Fab-PAS400. Remarkably, 6- and 5-fold higher tumor-to-blood ratios compared with the unmodified Fabs were measured in the biodistribution analysis (48 h p.i.) for alphaHER2 Fab-PAS100 and Fab-PAS200, respectively. These findings were confirmed by PET studies, showing high imaging contrast in line with tumor-to-blood ratios of 12.2 and 5.7 (24 h p.i.) for alphaHER2 Fab-PAS100 and Fab-PAS200. Even stronger tumor signals were obtained with the corresponding alphaCD20 Fabs, both in PET imaging and biodistribution analysis, with an uptake of 2.8% ID/g for Fab-PAS100 vs. 0.24% ID/g for the unmodified Fab. Hence, by engineering Fabs via PASylation, plasma half-life can be tailored to significantly improve tracer uptake and tumor contrast, thus optimally matching reagent/target interactions.","['Mendler, Claudia T', 'Friedrich, Lars', 'Laitinen, Iina', 'Schlapschy, Martin', 'Schwaiger, Markus', 'Wester, Hans-Jurgen', 'Skerra, Arne']","['Mendler CT', 'Friedrich L', 'Laitinen I', 'Schlapschy M', 'Schwaiger M', 'Wester HJ', 'Skerra A']","['a Munich Center for Integrated Protein Science (CIPS-M) and Lehrstuhl fur Biologische Chemie ; Technische Universitat Munchen ; Freising-Weihenstephan , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,PMC4622060,['NOTNLM'],"['ABD, albumin binding domain', 'CD20', 'CDC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity', 'CDR, complementarity-determining region', 'CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia', ""DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium"", 'EPR, enhanced permeability and retention effect', 'FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'Fab, antigen-binding fragment', 'FcRn, neonatal Fc receptor', 'HER2', 'HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2', 'ID, injected dose', 'IDA, iminodiacetic acid', 'Ig, immunoglobulin', 'MIP, maximum intensity projection', 'NHL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'PEGylation', 'PET, positron emission tomography', 'PK, pharmacokinetics', 'RIT, radioimmuno therapy', 'SEC, size exclusion chromatography', 'SPECT, single photon emission computed tomography', 'TLC, thin layer chromatography', 'antibody fragment', 'mAb, monoclonal antibody', 'p.i., post injection', 'plasma half-life', 'protein tracer', 'scFv, single-chain variable antibody fragment']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/19420862.2014.985522 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2015;7(1):96-109. doi: 10.4161/19420862.2014.985522.,,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Antigens, CD20', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Iodine Isotopes/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Isotope Labeling', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Positron-Emission Tomography', '*Receptor, ErbB-2']","['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Iodine Isotopes)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have questioned the tumor suppressive role of autophagy, as autophagy-related gene (Atg) defects generally suppress tumorigenesis in well-characterized mouse tumor models. We now report that, while it delays or does not alter mammary tumorigenesis driven by Palb2 loss or ERBB2 and PyMT overexpression, monoallelic Becn1 loss promotes mammary tumor development in 2 specific contexts, namely following parity and in association with wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 1 (WNT1) activation. Our studies demonstrate that Becn1 heterozygosity, which results in immature mammary epithelial cell expansion and aberrant TNFRSF11A/TNR11/RANK (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 11a, NFKB activator) signaling, promotes mammary tumorigenesis in multiparous FVB/N mice and in cooperation with the progenitor cell-transforming WNT1 oncogene. Similar to our Becn1(+/-);MMTV-Wnt1 mouse model, low BECN1 expression and an activated WNT pathway gene signature correlate with the triple-negative subtype, TNFRSF11A axis activation and poor prognosis in human breast cancers. Our results suggest that BECN1 may have nonautophagy-related roles in mammary development, provide insight in the seemingly paradoxical roles of BECN1 in tumorigenesis, and constitute the basis for further studies on the pathophysiology and treatment of clinically aggressive triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs).","['Cicchini, Michelle', 'Chakrabarti, Rumela', 'Kongara, Sameera', 'Price, Sandy', 'Nahar, Ritu', 'Lozy, Fred', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Vazquez, Alexei', 'Kang, Yibin', 'Karantza, Vassiliki']","['Cicchini M', 'Chakrabarti R', 'Kongara S', 'Price S', 'Nahar R', 'Lozy F', 'Zhong H', 'Vazquez A', 'Kang Y', 'Karantza V']","['a Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey ; New Brunswick , NJ USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141030,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,PMC4502817,['NOTNLM'],"['8-O-dG, 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydroguanine', 'ATG, autophagy-related', 'BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy-related', 'BSA, bovine serum albumin', 'Beclin 1', 'CASP3, caspase 3', 'CD24, cluster of differentiation 24', ""DAPI, 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole"", 'DFS, disease-free survival', ""DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium"", 'E, 17b-estradiol', 'EGF, epidermal growth factor', 'EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein', 'EGFR/ERBB1, epidermal growth factor receptor', 'EM, electron microscopy', 'EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition', 'ERBB2, v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2', 'ESR1, estrogen receptor 1', 'FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting', 'FGF2/bFGF, fibroblast growth factor 2 (basic)', 'GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis', 'H&E, hematoxylin &, eosin', 'HR, hormone receptor', 'IF, immunofluorescence', 'IHC, immunohistochemistry', 'IL, interleukin', 'ITGB1/CD29, Integrin, beta 1 (fibronectin receptor beta polypeptide, antigen CD29', 'includes MDF2, MSK12)', 'ITGB3/CD61, integrin, beta 3 (platelet glycoprotein IIIa, antigen CD61)', 'KRT, keratin', 'Keratin 6', 'LIN-, lineage negative (CD31- CD45- LY76-)', 'LY76/TER119, lymphocyte antigen 76', 'MAP1LC3B/LC3B, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta', 'MEC, mammary epithelial cell', 'MEGM, mammary epithelial growth medium', 'MGs, mammary glands', 'MKI67, marker of proliferation Ki-67', 'MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus', 'MaPC, mammary progenitor cell', 'MaSC, mammary stem cell', 'NFKB', 'NFKB/NFkB, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells', 'PBS, phosphate-buffered saline', 'PECAM1/CD31, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1', 'PGR, progesterone receptor', 'PI, propidium iodide', 'PTPRC/CD45, protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C', 'RELA/P65, v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog a', 'ROS, reactive oxygen species', 'SD, standard deviation', 'SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms', 'SQSTM1/p62, sequestosome1', 'TEBs, terminal end buds', 'TNBC', 'TNBCs, triple-negative breast cancers', 'TNF, tumor necrosis factor', 'TNF11', 'TNFRSF11A', 'TNFRSF11A/TNR11/RANK, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 11a,', 'NFKB activator', 'TNFSF11', 'TNFSF11/TNF11/RANKL, tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11', 'TNR11', 'TP53 (TRP53 in mice), tumor protein p53 (transformation related protein 53 in', 'mice)', 'WNT1', 'WNT1, wingless-Type MMTV integration site family, member 1', 'basal-like breast cancer', 'iMMECs, immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells', 'p-KRT8/p-K8, phosphorylated Keratin 8', 'parity']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/15 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/auto.34398 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2014;10(11):2036-52. doi: 10.4161/auto.34398.

To study the clinical potential of olaparib as a single-agent for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, we analyzed the in vitro sensitivity of AML cell lines and primary blasts. Clinically achievable concentrations of olaparib were able to induce cell death in the majority of primary AML case samples (88%) and tested cell lines. At these concentrations, olaparib preferentially killed leukemic blasts sparing normal lymphocytes derived from the same patient and did not substantially affect the viability of normal bone marrow and CD34-enriched peripheral blood cells obtained from healthy donors. Most primary AML analyzed were characterized by low BRCA1 mRNA level and undetectable protein expression that likely contributed to explain their sensitivity to olaparib. Noteworthy, while PARP1 over-expression was detected in blasts not responsive to olaparib, phosphorylation of the histone H2AFX (gammaH2AX) was associated with drug sensitivity. As to genetic features of tested cases the highest sensitivity was shown by a patient carrying a 11q23 deletion. The high sensitivity of AML blasts and the identification of biomarkers potentially able to predict response and/or resistance may foster further investigation of olaparib monotherapy for AML patients unfit to conventional chemotherapy.","['Faraoni, Isabella', 'Compagnone, Mirco', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Angelini, Daniela Francesca', 'Cencioni, Maria Teresa', 'Piras, Eleonora', 'Panetta, Paola', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Dolci, Susanna', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Graziani, Grazia', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Faraoni I', 'Compagnone M', 'Lavorgna S', 'Angelini DF', 'Cencioni MT', 'Piras E', 'Panetta P', 'Ottone T', 'Dolci S', 'Venditti A', 'Graziani G', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy; Unit of Neuro-Oncohematology, Santa Lucia Foundation-I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.

Another study indicated that ANP32B was a direct substrate of caspase3, and was primarily cleaved at the sequence AlaGluValAsp, following Asp163. To investigate the significance of ANP32B cleavage in apoptosis, leukemic U937T cell lines were generated with inducible expression of ANP32B(wild type; WT), the uncleavable mutant ANP32B(D163A) and the Nterminal fragment ANP32B(1163). Notably, overexpression of ANP32B(WT) and ANP32B(D163A) moderately increased and significantly enhanced etoposideinduced apoptosis and caspase3 activation, whereas expression of ANP32B(1163) produced no effect. Two hypotheses have been generated, which may explain the distinct roles of the various ANP32B forms: i) ANP32B(WT) and ANP32B(D163A) localize in the nucleus while ANP32B(1163) mainly resides in the cytosol; or ii) ANP32B(WT) and ANP32B(D163A), but not ANP32B(1163), inhibit the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2.

However, clinical data indicate that antitumor immune responses generally fail to translate into measurable tumor regression. This has been ascribed to a variety of tolerance mechanisms, one of which is the expression of immunosuppressive factors by DCs and T cells. With respect to cancer immunotherapies, these factors antagonise the ability to induce robust and sustained immunity required for tumor cell eradication. Gene silencing of immunosuppressive factors in either DCs or adoptive transferred T cells enhanced anti-tumor immune responses and significantly inhibited tumor growth. Therefore, engineered next generation of DC vaccines or adoptive T-cell therapy should include immunomodulatory siRNAs to release the ""brakes"" imposed by the immune system. Moreover, the combination of gene silencing, antigen targeting to DCs and cytoplasmic cargo delivery will improve clinical benefits.","['Sioud, Mouldy']",['Sioud M'],"['a Department of Immunology; Institute for Cancer Research ; Oslo University Hospital ; Montebello , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,PMC4514080,['NOTNLM'],"['AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'CMV, human cytomegalovirus', 'CTLA4, T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4', 'DC, Dendritic cells', 'Gal, galectin hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase', 'IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase', 'IL, interleukin', 'INF, interferon', 'NK, natural killer', 'PD1, programmed cell death', 'RNA interference', 'RNAi, RNA interference', 'SOCS1, suppressor of cytokine signaling', 'STAT, Signal transducer and activator of transcription', 'T-cell therapy', 'TCR, T cell receptor', 'TLR, toll like receptor', 'Treg, Regulatory T', 'cancer vaccine', 'gene silencing', 'immunotherapy', 'siRNA, small interfering RNA', 'targeted therapies']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/hv.29754 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2014;10(11):3165-74. doi: 10.4161/hv.29754.,,IM,"['Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/genetics', 'Neoplasms/immunology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation']","['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Posttranslational hydroxylation of proline residues occurs in DPYSP(OH)S motifs, which are repeated 2 or 3 times in different isoforms. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of proline hydroxylation on IgE binding and the relative contributions of linear and conformational epitopes to Ara h 2 allergenicity. METHODS: Peptides containing DPYSP(OH)S motifs were synthesized. A recombinant variant of Ara h 2 without DPYSP(OH)S motifs was generated by means of deletion mutagenesis. IgE reactivity of 18 French and 5 American patients with peanut allergy toward synthetic peptides and recombinant allergens was assessed by using IgE-binding inhibition assays and degranulation tests of humanized rat basophilic leukemia cells. RESULTS: Hydroxyproline-containing peptides exhibited an IgE-binding activity equivalent to that of the unfolded Ara h 2. In contrast, corresponding peptides without hydroxyprolines displayed a very weak IgE-binding capacity. Despite removal of the DPYSP(OH)S motifs, the deletion variant still displayed Ara h 2 conformational epitopes. The IgE-binding capacity of Ara h 2 was then recapitulated with an equimolar mixture of a hydroxylated peptide and the deletion variant. Hydroxylated peptides of 15 and 27 amino acid residues were also able to trigger cell degranulation. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization toward linear and conformational epitopes of Ara h 2 is variable among patients with peanut allergy. Optimal IgE binding to linear epitopes of Ara h 2 requires posttranslational hydroxylation of proline residues. The absence of hydroxyprolines could then affect the accuracy of component-resolved diagnostics by using rAra h 2.","['Bernard, Herve', 'Guillon, Blanche', 'Drumare, Marie-Francoise', 'Paty, Evelyne', 'Dreskin, Stephen C', 'Wal, Jean-Michel', 'Adel-Patient, Karine', 'Hazebrouck, Stephane']","['Bernard H', 'Guillon B', 'Drumare MF', 'Paty E', 'Dreskin SC', 'Wal JM', 'Adel-Patient K', 'Hazebrouck S']","[""INRA, UR 496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Jouy-en-Josas, France; CEA, iBiTecS/Service de Pharmacologie et d'Immunoanalyse, Gif-sur-Yvette, France."", ""INRA, UR 496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Jouy-en-Josas, France; CEA, iBiTecS/Service de Pharmacologie et d'Immunoanalyse, Gif-sur-Yvette, France."", ""INRA, UR 496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Jouy-en-Josas, France; CEA, iBiTecS/Service de Pharmacologie et d'Immunoanalyse, Gif-sur-Yvette, France."", 'Universite Paris Descartes-Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colo.', ""INRA, UR 496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Jouy-en-Josas, France; CEA, iBiTecS/Service de Pharmacologie et d'Immunoanalyse, Gif-sur-Yvette, France."", ""INRA, UR 496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Jouy-en-Josas, France; CEA, iBiTecS/Service de Pharmacologie et d'Immunoanalyse, Gif-sur-Yvette, France."", ""INRA, UR 496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Jouy-en-Josas, France; CEA, iBiTecS/Service de Pharmacologie et d'Immunoanalyse, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.

However, a conceptual understanding of its biological role is required before consideration of this protein for therapeutic settings. Here, we reveal the detailed mechanism of action underlying the biological responses mediated by the Tim-3 receptor in myeloid cells. Our studies demonstrate that Tim-3 triggers growth factor type responses in acute myeloid leukaemia cells by activating a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. In addition, the receptor activates hypoxic signalling pathways upregulating glycolysis and pro-angiogenic responses. These findings suggest that Tim-3 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for immune therapy and drug delivery in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells.","['Prokhorov, Alexandr', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Bardelli, Marco', 'Ruegg, Laura', 'Fasler-Kan, Elizaveta', 'Varani, Luca', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Prokhorov A', 'Gibbs BF', 'Bardelli M', 'Ruegg L', 'Fasler-Kan E', 'Varani L', 'Sumbayev VV']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Anson Building, Central Avenue, Chatham Maritime, Kent ME4 4TB, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Anson Building, Central Avenue, Chatham Maritime, Kent ME4 4TB, UK.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Via Vela 6, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Anson Building, Central Avenue, Chatham Maritime, Kent ME4 4TB, UK; High School of Life Sciences, University of Applied Sciences North-Western Switzerland, Muttenz, Switzerland.', 'High School of Life Sciences, University of Applied Sciences North-Western Switzerland, Muttenz, Switzerland; Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.

The Diaphanous-related formins (DRF) represent a diverse group of Rho-GTPase-regulated actin regulators that control a range of actin structures composed of tightly-bundled, unbranched actin filaments as found in stress fibers and in filopodia. Under resting conditions, DRFs are auto-inhibited by an intra-molecular interaction between the C-terminal and the N-terminal domains. The auto-inhibition is thought to be released by binding of an activated RhoGTPase to the N-terminal GTPase-binding domain (GBD). However, there is growing evidence for more sophisticated variations from this simplified linear activation model. In this review we focus on the formin homology domain-containing proteins (FHOD), an unconventional group of DRFs. Recent findings on the molecular control and cellular functions of FHOD proteins in vivo are discussed in the light of the phylogeny of FHOD proteins.","['Bechtold, Meike', 'Schultz, Jorg', 'Bogdan, Sven']","['Bechtold M', 'Schultz J', 'Bogdan S']","['a Institut fur Neurobiologie ; Universitat Munster ; Munster , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Small GTPases,Small GTPases,101530974,PMC4601495,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-1B, acute myeloid leukemia transcription factor', 'DAD, diaphanous auto-regulatory domain', 'DID, diaphanous inhibitory domain', 'DRF, Diaphanous-related formins', 'Dia, Diaphanous related formin', 'FH1, formin homology 1', 'FH2, formin homology 2', 'FH3, formin homology 3', 'FHOD', 'FHOD, FH1/FH2 domain-containing protein', 'GBD, GTPase-binding domain', 'RhoGTPases', 'SRE, serum response element', 'actin', 'cell migration', 'formins']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/07/24 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/21541248.2014.973765 [doi]'],ppublish,Small GTPases. 2014;5(2):11. doi: 10.4161/21541248.2014.973765.,,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Microfilament Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']","['0 (Microfilament Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr-Abl/T315I is the predominant mutation that causes resistance to Imatinib. In the present study, we synthesized a novel Bcr-Abl inhibitor, HS-543, and investigated its effect on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells bearing Bcr-Abl/T315I (BaF3/T315I) or wild-type Bcr-Abl (BaF3/WT). HS-543 showed anti-proliferative effects in the BaF3/WT cells as well as the BaF3/T315I cells with resistance to Imatinib and strongly inhibited the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it significantly increased the sub G1 phase associated with early apoptosis, with increased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3, as well as the TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. In addition, we found that HS-543 induced apoptosis with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by decreasing the expression of Mcl-1 and survivin, together with increasing that of Bax. In BaF3/T315I xenograft models, HS-543 significantly delayed tumor growth, unlike Imatinib. Our results demonstrate that HS-543 exhibits the induction of apoptosis and anti-proliferative effect by blocking the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in the T315I-mutated Bcr-Abl cells with resistance to Imatinib.

We showed that expression of BCR-ABL1 correlates with decreased level of BRCA1 protein, which promoted aberrant mitoses and aneuploidy as well as altered DNA damage response. Using polysome profiling and luciferase-BRCA1 3'UTR reporter system here we demonstrate that downregulation of BRCA1 protein in CML is caused by inhibition of BRCA1 mRNA translation, but not by increased protein degradation or reduction of mRNA level and half-life. We investigated 2 mRNA-binding proteins - HuR and TIAR showing specificity to AU-Rich Element (ARE) sites in 3'UTR of mRNA. BCR-ABL1 promoted cytosolic localization of TIAR and HuR, their binding to BRCA1 mRNA and formation of the TIAR-HuR complex. HuR protein positively regulated BRCA1 mRNA stability and translation, conversely TIAR negatively regulated BRCA1 translation and was found localized predominantly in the cytosolic stress granules in CML cells. TIAR-dependent downregulation of BRCA1 protein level was a result of ER stress, which is activated in BCR-ABL1 expressing cells, as we previously shown.

We recently used a systematic proteomic approach to generate a protein interactome map of the human miRNA pathway involved in miRNA biogenesis and processing. The interactome expands the number of candidate proteins in the miRNA pathway and connects the network to other cellular processes. Functional analyses identified TRIM65 and at least 3 other proteins as novel regulators of the miRNA pathway. Biochemical studies established that TRIM65 forms stable complexes with TNRC6 proteins and these molecules co-localize in P-body-like structures. Gain of function and RNAi analyses reveal that TRIM65 negatively regulates miRNA-driven suppression of mRNA translation by targeting TNRC6 proteins for ubiquitination and degradation.

In the present study, we determined the effect of dasatinib which was approved for imatinib resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment on P-gp-mediated MDR. Our results showed that dasatinib significantly increased the sensitivity of P-gp-overexpressing MCF-7/Adr cells to doxorubicin in MTT assays; thus lead to an enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in MCF-7/Adr cells. Additionally, dasatinib increased the intracellular accumulation, inhibited the efflux of doxorubicin in MCF-7/Adr cells, and significantly enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7/Adr cells. Further studies showed that dasatinib altered the expression levels of mRNA, protein levels of P-gp, and the phosphorylation of signal-regulated kinase (ERK) both in time-dependent (before 24 h) and dose-dependent manners at concentrations that produced MDR reversals. In conclusion, dasatinib reverses P-gp-mediated MDR by downregulating P-gp expression, which may be partly attributed to the inhibition of ERK pathway. Dasatinib may play an important role in circumventing MDR when combined with other conventional antineoplastic drugs.","['Chen, Ting', 'Wang, Changyuan', 'Liu, Qi', 'Meng, Qiang', 'Sun, Huijun', 'Huo, Xiaokui', 'Sun, Pengyuan', 'Peng, Jinyong', 'Liu, Zhihao', 'Yang, Xiaobo', 'Liu, Kexin']","['Chen T', 'Wang C', 'Liu Q', 'Meng Q', 'Sun H', 'Huo X', 'Sun P', 'Peng J', 'Liu Z', 'Yang X', 'Liu K']","['a Department of Clinical Pharmacology; College of Pharmacy ; Dalian Medical University ; Dalian , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC4622436,['NOTNLM'],"['DOX, doxorubicin', 'ERK pathway', 'ERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'MDR, multidrug resistance', 'P-ERK, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'P-glycoprotein', 'P-gp, P-glycoprotein', 'dasatinib', 'doxorubicin', 'multidrug resistance']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384047.2014.987062 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(1):106-14. doi: 10.4161/15384047.2014.987062.,,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipid vectors for nucleic acid delivery that have been widely investigated for years can be very effective. As the majority of attempts made in the field of cancer gene therapy have focused on solid tumors, while blood cancer cells have attracted less attention, the latter became the subject of our investigation. The lipid carrier proposed here is based on liposomes constructed by others but the lipid composition is original. A liposome-coated lipoplex (L-cL) consists of a core arising from complexation of positively charged lipid and negatively charged oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) or plasmid DNA coated by a neutral or anionic lipid bilayer. Moreover, our lipid vector demonstrates size stability and is able to retain a high content of enclosed plasmid DNA or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (asODNs). Observed transfection efficacies of the tested preparation using a plasmid coding for fluorescent protein were up to 60-85% of examined leukemia cells (Jurkat T and HL-60 lines) in the absence or the presence of serum. When BCL2 asODN was encapsulated in the L-cL, specific silencing of this gene product at both the mRNA and protein level and also a markedly decreased cell survival rate were observed in vitro. Moreover, biodistribution analysis in mice indicates prolonged circulation characteristic for PEG-modified liposomal carriers. Experiments on tumor-engrafted animals indicate substantial inhibition of tumor growth.","['Wyrozumska, Paulina', 'Meissner, Justyna', 'Toporkiewicz, Monika', 'Szarawarska, Marta', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Ugorski, Maciej', 'Walasek, Marta A', 'Sikorski, Aleksander F']","['Wyrozumska P', 'Meissner J', 'Toporkiewicz M', 'Szarawarska M', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Ugorski M', 'Walasek MA', 'Sikorski AF']","['a Laboratory of Cytobiochemistry; Biotechnology Faculty ; University of Wroclaw ; Wroclaw , Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC4329851,['NOTNLM'],"['AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'BCL-2 gene', 'Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2 protein', 'CCL, coated cationic liposomes', ""DC-CHOL, 3beta-(N-[dimethylaminoethane]carbamoyl)cholesterol) DiD-1,1',"", ""dioctadecyl-3,3,3', 3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine"", 'DOPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine)', 'DOTAP, 1, 2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane)', 'DSPE, PEG-(1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene', 'glycol)2000] (ammonium salt)', 'GFP, green fluorescent protein', 'HPC, hydrogenated egg phosphatidylcholine)', 'L-cL, liposome-coated lipoplex', 'PE/PC, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine liposomes', 'acute leukemia', 'antisense deoxynucleotides', 'asODN, antisense oligodeoxynucleotide', 'cationic lipids', 'gene therapy', 'lipid carrier', 'lipoplex', 'liposome coated lipoplex', 'pDNA, plasmid DNA', 'siRNA, small interferingRNA TGI, tumor growth inhibition']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384047.2014.987009 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(1):66-76. doi: 10.4161/15384047.2014.987009.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', '*Liposomes/chemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/chemistry/genetics/pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRAIL, as a potent and specific inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells, would be a promising new treatment option. However, since not all pancreatic cancer cells respond to TRAIL, further improvements and optimizations are still needed. One strategy to improve the effectiveness of TRAIL-based therapies is to specifically target one of the 2 cell death inducing TRAIL-receptors, TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 to overcome resistance. To this end, we designed constructs expressing soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL) variants that were rendered specific for either TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 by amino acid changes in the TRAIL ectodomain. When we expressed these constructs, including wild-type sTRAIL (sTRAIL(wt)), TRAIL-R1 (sTRAIL(DR4)) and TRAIL-R2 (sTRAIL(DR5)) specific variants, in 293 producer cells we found all to be readily expressed and secreted into the supernatant. These supernatants were subsequently transferred onto target cancer cells and apoptosis measured. We found that the TRAIL-R1 specific variant had higher apoptosis-inducing activity in human pancreatic carcinoma Colo357 cells as well as PancTu1 cells that were additionally sensitized by targeting of XIAP. Finally, we tested TRAIL-R1 specific recombinant TRAIL protein (rTRAIL(DR4)) on Colo357 xenografts in nude mice and found them to be more efficacious than rTRAIL(wt). Our results demonstrate the benefits of synthetic biological approaches and show that TRAIL-R1 specific variants can potentially enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies in pancreatic cancer, suggesting that they can possibly become part of individualized and tumor specific combination treatments in the future.","['Yu, Rui', 'Albarenque, Stella Maris', 'Cool, Robbert H', 'Quax, Wim J', 'Mohr, Andrea', 'Zwacka, Ralf M']","['Yu R', 'Albarenque SM', 'Cool RH', 'Quax WJ', 'Mohr A', 'Zwacka RM']","['a National University of Ireland; Galway; National Centre for Biomedical Engineering Science and Apoptosis Research Centre; Molecular Therapeutics Group ; Galway , Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC4623120,['NOTNLM'],"['AML, Acute myeloid leukemia', 'ANOVA, Analysis of variance between groups', 'Apoptosis', 'BSA, Bovine Serum Albumin', 'Bcl-xL, B-cell lymphoma-extra large', 'CMV, Cytomegalie virus', 'CuZnSOD, Copper-Zinc Superoxide Dismutase', ""DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium"", 'DNA, Deoxyribonucleic acid', 'DR4 specific TRAIL variant', 'EGFP, Enhanced green fluorescent protein', 'ELISA, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay', 'FACS, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting', 'FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain', 'FBS, Fetal bovine serum', 'FIB, Fibrillin', 'FLIP, FLICE-like inhibitory protein', 'Furin CS, Furin cleavage site', 'IFN-g, Interferon-gamma', 'ILZ, Isoleucine zipper', 'MSC, Mesenchymal stem cell', 'NF-kappaB, Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells', 'OPG, Osteoprogerin', 'PBS, Phosphate buffered saline', 'PCR, Polymerase chain reaction', 'RANKL, Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand', 'RNAi, RNA interference', 'RPMI 1640 medium, Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium', 'SDS, Sodium dodecyl sulphate', 'SDS-PAGE, SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis', 'SEM, Standard error of the mean', 'TNF, Tumor necrosis factor', 'TRAIL', 'TRAIL receptor', 'TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand', 'TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-receptor 1/Death - receptor 4', 'TRAIL-R2/DR5, TRAIL-receptor 2/ Death - receptor 5', 'TRAIL-R3/DcR1, TRAIL-receptor 3/Decoy-receptor 1', 'TRAIL-R4/DcR2, TRAIL-receptor 4/Decoy-receptor 2', 'XIAP', 'XIAP, X-linked Inhibitor of apoptosis protein', 'pancreatic cancer', 'rTRAIL, recombinant TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand', 'sTRAIL, soluble TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand', 'sh-sequence, short-hairpin sequence']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384047.2014.972183 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2014;15(12):1658-66. doi: 10.4161/15384047.2014.972183.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/administration & dosage/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surveyed clinicians largely followed the current recommendations for prophylaxis in the setting of induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia, as well as autologous and low-risk allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In keeping with guideline recommendations, posaconazole was the agent used by most centres for high-risk allogeneic HSCT. However, its routine continuation for 75-100 days post-transplantation without de-escalation suggested use beyond those indications described in the 2008 guidelines, namely pre-engraftment neutropenia and graft-versus-host disease. Variations in practice were observed in other settings, such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, reflecting the general lack of evidence for antifungal prophylaxis in these patient populations and changing perceptions of risk. With regard to the availability of testing in cases of suspected breakthrough IFD, 40% of centres did not have access to investigative bronchoscopy within 48 h of referral, and results of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM), fungal polymerase chain reaction and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were not available within 48 h in 83%, 90% and 85% of centres respectively.

SDF-1/CXCR4 axis acts as a principle regulator in homing and engraftment, however, CXCR4 signaling is dependent upon expression of CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1, which is highly dynamic. Hence, present investigation was aimed to explore the potential of CXCR4 constitutive active mutants (CXCR4-CAMs) in overcoming the limitation of CXCR4 signaling and up-modulate its efficiency in homing and engraftment. Regulated transgene expression study of these mutants revealed their significantly enhanced cell adhesion efficiency to endothelium and extracellular matrix protein. This altogether indicates promising prospects of CXCR4-CAMs in research aimed to improve HSPCs engraftment efficiency.","['Sharma, Menka', 'Afrin, Farhat', 'Tripathi, Rajendra P', 'Gangenahalli, Gurudutta']","['Sharma M', 'Afrin F', 'Tripathi RP', 'Gangenahalli G']","['a Stem Cell & Gene Therapy Research Group ; Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences ; Delhi , India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Adh Migr,Cell adhesion & migration,101469464,PMC4594461,['NOTNLM'],"['Ala, Alanine', 'Asn, Asparagine', 'BM, Bone Marrow', 'BMEC, Bone marrow endothelial cells', 'BSA, Bovine Serum Albumin', 'CAMs, Constitutive Active Mutants', 'CXCR4', 'Conc., Concentration', 'ECM, Extracellular matrix', 'FBS, Fetal Bovine Serum', 'FN, Fibronectin', 'HSPCs', 'HSPCs, Hematopoietic Stem/ Progenitor Cells', 'HUVECs, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells', ""IMDM, Iscove's Modified Dulbecco Media"", 'LIF, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MCS, Multi Cloning Site', 'Ser, Serine', 'TM3, Transmembrane three domain', 'engraftment', 'homing']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/cam.29285 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Adh Migr. 2014;8(4):384-8. doi: 10.4161/cam.29285.,,IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transgenes']","['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor heterogeneity likely arises both from clonal expansions, as well as from differentiation hierarchies existent in the tumor, such as that established by cancer stem cells (CSCs) and non-CSCs. These differentiation hierarchies may arise due to genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, or microenvironmental influences. An additional differentiation hierarchy within epithelial tumors may arise when only a few tumor cells trans-differentiate into mesenchymal-like cells, a process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Again, this process can be influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors. In this review we discuss the evidence for clonal interaction and cooperation for tumor maintenance and progression, particularly with respect to EMT, and further address the far-reaching effects that tumor heterogeneity may have on cancer therapy.","['Neelakantan, Deepika', 'Drasin, David J', 'Ford, Heide L']","['Neelakantan D', 'Drasin DJ', 'Ford HL']","['a Department of Pharmacology ; University of Colorado; School of Medicine ; Aurora, CO USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20141016,United States,Cell Adh Migr,Cell adhesion & migration,101469464,PMC4594578,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CSC, cancer stem cell', 'EMP, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity', 'EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition', 'GFP, green fluorescent protein.', 'MET, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition', 'MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus', 'NGS, next generation sequencing', 'OxR, oxaliplatin resistant', 'SCLC, small cell lung cancer', 'TGF-beta, transforming growth factor-beta', 'cancer stem cells/CSCs', 'clonal evolution', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)', 'hPDGF human platelet-derived growth factor', 'intratumoral heterogeneity', 'metastasis', 'miRNA, microRNA', 'non-cell autonomous', 'tumor microenvironment']",2014/12/09 06:00,2016/05/28 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/19336918.2014.972761 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Adh Migr. 2015;9(4):265-76. doi: 10.4161/19336918.2014.972761.

The observation that WT1 inactivating mutations anticorrelate with TET2/IDH1/IDH2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) led us to hypothesize that WT1 mutations may impact TET2 function. WT1 mutant AML patients have reduced 5hmC levels similar to TET2/IDH1/IDH2 mutant AML. These mutations are characterized by convergent, site-specific alterations in DNA hydroxymethylation, which drive differential gene expression more than alterations in DNA promoter methylation. WT1 overexpression increases global levels of 5hmC, and WT1 silencing reduced 5hmC levels. WT1 physically interacts with TET2 and TET3, and WT1 loss of function results in a similar hematopoietic differentiation phenotype as observed with TET2 deficiency. These data provide a role for WT1 in regulating DNA hydroxymethylation and suggest that TET2 IDH1/IDH2 and WT1 mutations define an AML subtype defined by dysregulated DNA hydroxymethylation.","['Rampal, Raajit', 'Alkalin, Altuna', 'Madzo, Jozef', 'Vasanthakumar, Aparna', 'Pronier, Elodie', 'Patel, Jay', 'Li, Yushan', 'Ahn, Jihae', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Shih, Alan', 'Lu, Chao', 'Ward, Patrick S', 'Tsai, Jennifer J', 'Hricik, Todd', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Tallman, Jacob E', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Daniels, Danette', 'Dai, Qing', 'Ciminio, Luisa', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'He, Chuan', 'Fuks, Francois', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Ferrando, Adolfo', 'Nimer, Stephen', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Thompson, Craig B', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Mason, Christopher E', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Rampal R', 'Alkalin A', 'Madzo J', 'Vasanthakumar A', 'Pronier E', 'Patel J', 'Li Y', 'Ahn J', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Shih A', 'Lu C', 'Ward PS', 'Tsai JJ', 'Hricik T', 'Tosello V', 'Tallman JE', 'Zhao X', 'Daniels D', 'Dai Q', 'Ciminio L', 'Aifantis I', 'He C', 'Fuks F', 'Tallman MS', 'Ferrando A', 'Nimer S', 'Paietta E', 'Thompson CB', 'Licht JD', 'Mason CE', 'Godley LA', 'Melnick A', 'Figueroa ME', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA; Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Centre for Molecular Medicine, Robert-Rossle-Strasse 10, 13125 Berlin, Germany.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Promega Corporation, Madison, WI 53703, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University Cancer Institute, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University Cancer Institute, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Epigenetics, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1070 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Montefiore Medical Center, New York, NY 10466, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Robert H.

Deregulated WNT signaling inhibits degradation of beta-catenin, causing increased nuclear translocation and co-factor activity of beta-catenin with the transcriptional regulator T-cell factor (TCF) 4/lymphoid enhancer factor 1 in AML BPCs. Here, we determined the pre-clinical anti-AML activity of the anthraquinone oxime-analog BC2059 (BC), known to attenuate beta-catenin levels. BC treatment disrupted the binding of beta-catenin with the scaffold protein transducin beta-like 1 and proteasomal degradation and decline in the nuclear levels of beta-catenin. This was associated with reduced transcriptional activity of TCF4 and expression of its target genes, cyclin D1, c-MYC and survivin. BC treatment dose-dependently induced apoptosis of cultured and primary AML BPCs. Treatment with BC also significantly improved the median survival of immune-depleted mice engrafted with either cultured or primary AML BPCs, exhibiting nuclear expression of beta-catenin. Co-treatment with the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and BC synergistically induced apoptosis of cultured and primary AML BPCs, including those expressing FLT3-ITD, as well as further significantly improved the survival of immune-depleted mice engrafted with primary AML BPCs. These findings underscore the promising pre-clinical activity and warrant further testing of BC against human AML, especially those expressing FLT3-ITD.","['Fiskus, W', 'Sharma, S', 'Saha, S', 'Shah, B', 'Devaraj, S G T', 'Sun, B', 'Horrigan, S', 'Leveque, C', 'Zu, Y', 'Iyer, S', 'Bhalla, K N']","['Fiskus W', 'Sharma S', 'Saha S', 'Shah B', 'Devaraj SG', 'Sun B', 'Horrigan S', 'Leveque C', 'Zu Y', 'Iyer S', 'Bhalla KN']","['Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Beta Cat Pharmaceutical, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141208,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC4456205,,,2014/12/09 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014340 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.340 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1267-78. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.340.

We show here that a potent and LAT1 selective inhibitor (JPH203) decreased leukemic cell viability and proliferation, and induced transient autophagy followed by apoptosis. JPH203 could also alter the in vivo growth of luciferase-expressing-tPTEN-/- cells xenografted into nude mice. In contrast, JPH203 was nontoxic to normal murine thymocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. JPH203 interfered with constitutive activation of mTORC1 and Akt, decreased expression of c-myc and triggered an unfolded protein response mediated by the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) transcription factor associated with cell death. A JPH203-resistant tPTEN-/-clone appeared CHOP induction deficient.

PTPROt exhibits in vitro tumor-suppressor characteristics through the regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Here we generated transgenic (Tg) mice with B-cell-specific expression of PTPROt. Although lymphocyte development is normal in these mice, crossing them with TCL1 Tg mouse model of CLL results in a survival advantage compared with the TCL1 Tg mice. Gene expression profiling of splenic B-lymphocytes before detectable signs of CLL followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the most prominently regulated functions in TCL1 Tg vs non-transgenic (NTg) and TCL1 Tg vs PTPROt/TCL1 double Tg are the same and also biologically relevant to this study. Further, enhanced expression of the chemokine Ccl3, the oncogenic transcription factor Foxm1 and its targets in TCL1 Tg mice were significantly suppressed in the double Tg mice, suggesting a protective function of PTPROt against leukemogenesis. This study also showed that PTPROt-mediated regulation of Foxm1 involves activation of p53, a transcriptional repressor of Foxm1, which is facilitated through suppression of BCR signaling. These results establish the in vivo tumor-suppressive function of PTPROt and identify p53/Foxm1 axis as a key downstream effect of PTPROt-mediated suppression of BCR signaling.","['Motiwala, T', 'Kutay, H', 'Zanesi, N', 'Frissora, F W', 'Mo, X', 'Muthusamy, N', 'Jacob, S T']","['Motiwala T', 'Kutay H', 'Zanesi N', 'Frissora FW', 'Mo X', 'Muthusamy N', 'Jacob ST']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', '1] Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141208,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC4456291,,,2014/12/09 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014341 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.341 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1350-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.341.

NBs, as well as their master organizer--the PML protein--exhibit multiple connections with stress responses. Initially viewed as a tumor suppressor, PML recently re-emerged as a multifaceted protein, capable of controlling numerous aspects of cellular homeostasis. NBs recruit many functionally diverse proteins and function as stress-regulated sumoylation factories. SUMO-initiated partner retention can subsequently facilitate a variety of other post-translational modifications, as well as partner degradation. With this newly elucidated central role of stress-enhanced sumoylation, it should now be possible to build a working model for the different NB-regulated cellular activities. Moreover, pharmacological manipulation of NB formation by interferons or oxidants holds the promise of clearing many undesirable proteins for clinical management of malignant, viral or neurodegenerative diseases.","['Sahin, Umut', 'de The, Hugues', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie']","['Sahin U', 'de The H', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V']","['a University Paris Diderot; Sorbonne Paris Cite ; Hopital St. Louis ; Paris , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Nucleus,"Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)",101518322,PMC4615786,['NOTNLM'],"['PML', 'RNF4', 'SIM', 'SUMO', 'arsenic', 'degradation', 'interferon', 'nuclear bodies', 'oxidative stress', 'post-translational modifications', 'senescence']",2014/12/09 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/12/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/19491034.2014.970104 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleus. 2014;5(6):499-507. doi: 10.4161/19491034.2014.970104.,,IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/*genetics', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteolysis', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*genetics', 'Sumoylation/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIM1 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aberrant expression of Mcl-1 is important for sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in gastric cancer. However, the regulatory mechanism of Mcl-1 in gastric cancer cells remains unclear. In this study, we first found that Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and Mcl-1 expression levels were positively correlated in human gastric cancer specimens and that both are associated with poor prognosis of patients treated with oxaliplatin. Second, we demonstrated that the expression level of Mcl-1 was correlated with FOXM1 expression in gastric cancer cells. Third, reporter assays showed that FOXM1 upregulated the promoter activity of the Mcl-1 gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further demonstrated that FOXM1 could bind to a particular site (-635acaaacaa-628) in the promoter region of the Mcl-1 gene. Moreover, CCK-8 assays and analyses of apoptosis revealed that the suppression of the FOXM1/Mcl-1 pathway induced apoptosis and thus increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in gastric cancer cells, whereas the enhancement of the FOXM1/Mcl-1 pathway inhibited apoptosis and decreased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in gastric cancer cells. Taken together, this study is the first to not only show that Mcl-1 is a novel target gene of FOXM1 but also suggest that targeting FOXM1/Mcl-1 may be a novel strategy to enhance sensitivity to oxaliplatin in gastric cancer.","['Hu, Chang-Jiang', 'Wang, Bin', 'Tang, Bo', 'Chen, Bai-jun', 'Xiao, Yu-Feng', 'Qin, Yong', 'Yong, Xin', 'Luo, Gang', 'Zhang, Jian-Wei', 'Zhang, Dan', 'Li, Song', 'He, Fengtian', 'Yang, Shi-Ming']","['Hu CJ', 'Wang B', 'Tang B', 'Chen BJ', 'Xiao YF', 'Qin Y', 'Yong X', 'Luo G', 'Zhang JW', 'Zhang D', 'Li S', 'He F', 'Yang SM']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.', 'Center for Pharmacogenetics, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.

We examined the differentiation marker, CD11b, in bone marrow cells (BMC) of an APL patient, in NB4 cells (APL cell line), and in normal BMC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy subjects by flow cytometric analysis. ATRA/RA induced expression of CD11b in the BMC of the APL patient and in NB4 cells, but not in normal BMC or PBMC. Therefore, we realized that RA potentiated ATRA-induced macrophage differentiation in APL cells. Further characterization of the induced macrophages showed that they exhibited morphological changes and were able to phagocytose and generate reactive oxygen species. Th also had typical expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1), CCR2, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Moreover, the expression of CD11b(+) and CD14(+) cells depended on ERK-NF-kappaB axis activation. Together, these results indicate that RA potentiates ATRA-induced macrophage differentiation in APL cells. Thus, RA may play an important role as an appurtenant differentiation agent for functional macrophage differentiation in APL. Additionally, the differentiated macrophages might have a normal life span and, they could die. These data indicate that co-treatment with RA and ATRA has potential as an anti-leukemic therapy in APL.","['Heo, Sook-Kyoung', 'Noh, Eui-Kyu', 'Yoon, Dong-Joon', 'Jo, Jae-Cheol', 'Koh, SuJin', 'Baek, Jin Ho', 'Park, Jae-Hoo', 'Min, Young Joo', 'Kim, Hawk']","['Heo SK', 'Noh EK', 'Yoon DJ', 'Jo JC', 'Koh S', 'Baek JH', 'Park JH', 'Min YJ', 'Kim H']","['Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Myongji Hospital, Gyeonggi-do 412-270, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.

We compared the expansion, memory T cell subsets and cytotoxicity for T cells expanded in parallel by the two methods. Bead-stimulated T cells showed superior expansion as compared to CIK cells on D14 of culture. Bead-stimulated T cells consisted of a significantly higher CD4(+) subset and significantly lower CD8(+) subset as compared to CIK cells, as well as a higher proportion of less terminally differentiated T cells and a higher proportion of homing molecules. On the other hand, CIK cells exhibited significantly superior cytotoxicity against two myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and U937) and two RCC cell lines (786.0 and CaKi-2). The cytotoxicity on D14 against THP-1 was 58.1 % for CIK cells and 8.3 % for bead-stimulated T cells at E:T of 10:1 (p < 0.01). Cytotoxicity correlated positively with the proportion of the CD8 subset in the culture and was independent of NKG2D recognition of susceptible targets. Polyclonal T cells expanded by different methods exhibit different characteristics which may define the specific role of each in different clinical scenario.

TCL1A gene allele frequencies were 26.1% (rs7158782, G), 27% (rs7159713, G), 21.2% (rs2369049, G) and 27.5% (rs11849538, G). Comparing our data across the 5 HapMap populations (CEU, GIH, HCB, JPT and YRI) huge inter-ethnic differences were exhibited in the variant allele frequencies, LD patterns and haplotype blocks. Our results emphasize the importance of normative frequency documentation and will offer significant clinical relevance in personalizing AIs therapy.","['Umamaheswaran, Gurusamy', 'Kadambari, Dharanipragada', 'Kumar, Annan Sudarsan Arun', 'Revathy, Mohan', 'Anjana, Raj', 'Adithan, Chandrasekaran', 'Dkhar, Steven Aibor']","['Umamaheswaran G', 'Kadambari D', 'Kumar AS', 'Revathy M', 'Anjana R', 'Adithan C', 'Dkhar SA']","['ICMR Centre for Advanced Research in Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry 605006, India.

We previously reported the presence of bone marrow (BM) RS in Sf3b1 heterozygous (Sf3b1 (+/-)) mice which are rarely found in mouse models of MDS. Sf3b1 (+/-) mice were originally engineered to study the interaction between polycomb genes and other proteins. METHODS: We used routine blood tests and histopathologic analysis of BM, spleen, and liver to evaluate the hematologic and morphologic characteristics of Sf3b1 (+/-) mice in the context of MDS by comparing the long term follow-up (15 months) of Sf3b1 (+/-) and Sf3b1 (+/+) mice. We then performed a comprehensive RNA-sequencing analysis to evaluate the transcriptome of BM cells from Sf3b1 (+/-) and Sf3b1 (+/+) mice. RESULTS: Sf3b1 (+/-) exhibited macrocytic anemia (MCV: 49.5 +/- 1.6 vs 47.2 +/- 1.4; Hgb: 5.5 +/- 1.7 vs 7.2 +/- 1.0) and thrombocytosis (PLTs: 911.4 +/- 212.1 vs 878.4 +/- 240.9) compared to Sf3b1 (+/+) mice. BM analysis showed dyserythropoiesis and occasional RS in Sf3b1 (+/-) mice. The splenic architecture showed increased megakaryocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei, and evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis. RNA-sequencing showed higher expression of a gene set containing Jak2 in Sf3b1 (+/-) compared to Sf3b1 (+/+). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that Sf3b1 (+/-) mice manifest features of low risk MDS-RS and may be relevant for preclinical therapeutic studies.","['Visconte, Valeria', 'Tabarroki, Ali', 'Zhang, Li', 'Parker, Yvonne', 'Hasrouni, Edy', 'Mahfouz, Reda', 'Isono, Kyoichi', 'Koseki, Haruhiko', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Barnard, John', 'Lindner, Daniel', 'Rogers, Heesun J', 'Tiu, Ramon V']","['Visconte V', 'Tabarroki A', 'Zhang L', 'Parker Y', 'Hasrouni E', 'Mahfouz R', 'Isono K', 'Koseki H', 'Sekeres MA', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Barnard J', 'Lindner D', 'Rogers HJ', 'Tiu RV']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue R40, Cleveland, OH, USA, 44195. visconv@ccf.org.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue R40, Cleveland, OH, USA, 44195. ali.tabarroki@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Although these data sets do not offer spatial or cell type-specific information, they can be extremely useful for gene discovery when analyzed by the appropriate techniques. Previously, we proposed and validated the use of combinatorial dataset analysis techniques to identify novel genes required during pre-implantation development. Now we build upon this work to identify genes that have dynamic expression during gametogenesis. Here we present detailed analysis of the expression pattern of leukemia-associated, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to 1 (Mllt1) gene. We document a novel splice isoform of Mllt1 and confirm that both Mllt1 mRNA isoforms are translated. We provide data supporting that MLLT1 protein isoforms display distinct stage-specific expression during spermiogenesis and adult tissues. Finally, we evaluated genes neighboring the Mllt1 locus, and show dynamic stage specific expression patterns of other genes Catsperd, Prr22, Rfx2 and Slc25a41. We document testes expressed alternative isoforms of Prr22 and Rfx2.

We hypothesized that the prognostic significance of pCytAbnl in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in mCR varies with cytogenetic risk group. We analyzed the data on 118 patients with AML and abnormal cytogenetics who underwent HSCT in mCR, and developed a risk stratification model based on pCytAbnl and cytogenetic risk group. The model distinguished three groups of patients (P<0.01) with distinct outcomes: the group with pCytAbnl and unfavorable risk cytogenetics (n=25) had the shortest median time to relapse (TTR; 5 months), relapse-free survival (RFS; 3 months), and overall survival (OS; 7 months). The group with favorable/intermediate risk cytogenetics and without pCytAbnl (n=43) had the longest median TTR (not reached), RFS (57 months), and OS (57 months). The group with pCytAbnl and favorable/intermediate risk cytogenetics, or, without pCytAbnl but with unfavorable risk cytogenetics (n=50) experienced intermediate TTR (18 months), RFS (9 months), and OS (18 months).

A phase I study of ARRY-614, an oral dual inhibitor of p38 MAPK and Tie2, was conducted in patients with low or intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System risk MDS to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary responses by International Working Group 2006 criteria. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-five patients received ARRY-614 either once daily or twice daily in dose escalation (400, 600, 900, or 1,200 mg once daily; 200 or 300 mg twice daily) or expansion cohorts. RESULTS: The 300 mg twice daily schedule was not tolerated, and an MTD was not reached for once daily dosing. Treatment-related adverse events were primarily grade 1-2, with the most common being rash, diarrhea, dry skin, fatigue and anorexia. Interpatient PK variability was high, although exposure was sufficient to achieve reduction in p38 MAPK activation in bone marrow and in the levels of circulating biomarkers. Disease responses were observed in 14 of 44 (32%) evaluable patients, 13 (93%) of whom had previously been treated with a hypomethylating agent. Responses were observed in all lineages, with 5 patients experiencing bilineage responses. Three of 25 red blood cell transfusion-dependent (TD) patients achieved transfusion independence (TI) and 5 of 7 platelet TD patients achieved TI. CONCLUSIONS: ARRY-614 was well tolerated and has sufficient activity to warrant further evaluation in this patient population.

There is a paucity of information addressing high-dose chemotherapy in obese patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: The Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) designed an electronic survey to assess current practice of dose adjustment of chemotherapy in obese patients undergoing HSCT. RESULTS: A total of 56 EBMT centers from 27 countries responded to the online survey. Overall, 45 centers declared that they routinely adjust chemotherapy doses for obese patients (80.5%), and only 11 (19.5%) declared they do not adjust dose. Among the former group, most used body mass index as the parameter for defining obesity (28 centers, 62%). The method for determining the weight for chemotherapy calculation was actual body weight (ABW) in 16 centers, ideal body weight (IBW) in 10 centers, IBW plus 25% of the difference between IBW and ABW in 16 centers, and other methods for the rest. Among centers that used dose adjustment, 44% also capped the dose at 2 m(2) for a chemotherapy dose based on body surface area (BSA), whereas 56% did not cap. Interestingly, most of the centers (9 of 11) that did not adjust dose for weight also did not cap the BSA at 2 m(2). CONCLUSION: This EBMT survey revealed large diversity among transplant centers regarding dose-adjustment practice for high-dose conditioning chemotherapy.

Yet current therapy has changed little over the decades and includes the nucleoside analog cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline as primary therapy. With this approach, durable cures occur in the minority of patients. With the recent improved scientific understanding of the underlying genetic and epigenetic aberrations in AML, there is now the potential of individualized and targeted therapeutic approaches for the curative treatment of AML. AREAS COVERED: The focus of this article is to review the therapeutic potential of many of the novel agents currently under investigation in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The results of pivotal Phase III studies, as well as ongoing Phase II and III studies and selected Phase I studies with impact on the field of AML therapy will be discussed.

Clinical significance and morphogenetic alterations associated with this uncommon phenomenon are not well defined. CASE REPORT: An 81-year-old Caucasian woman, affected by polycytemia vera lasting 17 years, presented in March 2012 with hyperleukocytosis, absolute neutrophilia, and thrombocytosis despite hydroxyurea treatment. All other laboratory parameters were normal, except for an increased neutrophil alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Reactive neutrophilia due to infection or neoplasia have been ruled out by a total body computerized tomography scan, and by low levels of C reactive protein. Re-evaluation of bone marrow showed hypercellular smears with expansion of granulopoiesis while immature granulocytes were <10% and myeloblasts were <1%. Bone marrow trephine biopsy showed hypercellular marrow, with panmyelosis, increased myeloid/erithroid ratio, polymorphic clusters of megakaryocytes. A loose network of reticulin fibers with many intersections was identified by means of Gomori's silver impregnation. There were no hybrid BCR/ABL gene transcripts of p210, p190 and p230, no mutations in platelet derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta. Flow cytometry on the aspirate showed that CD34+ CD117+ myeloblasts constituted less than 1% of total marrow nucleated cells, mature granulocytes demonstrated persistent expression of CD33. Mutational analysis of the gene CSF3R by PCR amplification revealed no alterations in exons 14-17, including codons 615 and 618. The case presented here represents a possible evolution of PV, albeit very rare. CONCLUSIONS: The condition described here differs from the CNL for the persistence of morphological pictures typical of myeloproliferative diseases, for absence of CSF3R gene mutations and for the hyper expansion of the mature granulopoietic series. The clinical significance and morphogenetic alterations associated with this uncommon phenomenon are not well defined.","['Castelli, Roberto', 'Cugno, Massimo', 'Gianelli, Umberto', 'Pancrazzi, Alessandro', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria']","['Castelli R', 'Cugno M', 'Gianelli U', 'Pancrazzi A', 'Vannucchi AM']","[""Department of Medicine and Medical Specialities, Ca' Granda Foundation IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy and Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Via F.

Zebularine (Zeb), a similar cytidine analog, also has demethylating activity as well as oral bioavailability. The hypothesis of the present study was that 6-TG and Zeb would cause downregulation of DNMT1 and globally demethylate the genomic DNA of canine lymphoma cells. The secondary hypothesis was that these agents would cause a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation in canine lymphoma cells. Canine CLGL-90 malignant T cells and CLL 17-7 cells were incubated in modified RPMI media. They were treated with 6-TG, Zeb, or control media at biologically relevant concentrations. RESULTS: Following treatment with each agent, DNMT1 protein and global DNA methylation were significantly decreased. A dose-dependent decrease in cell survival was also observed, with apoptosis being the primary mode of cell death in the CLGL-90 cell line. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the demethylating action of 6-TG and Zeb in canine cells which is similar to that shown in human cell lines. Confirmation of this mechanism supports the clinical application of these compounds as demethylating drugs in veterinary patients.","['Flesner, Brian K', 'Kumar, Senthil R', 'Bryan, Jeffrey N']","['Flesner BK', 'Kumar SR', 'Bryan JN']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, Comparative Oncology and Epigenetics Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia, 900 E.

HCL responds well to purine analogs but relapses are frequent and novel therapies are required. BRAF-V600E is the key driver mutation in HCL and distinguishes it from other B-cell lymphomas, including HCL-like leukemias/lymphomas (HCL-variant and splenic marginal zone lymphoma). The kinase-activating BRAF-V600E mutation also represents an ideal therapeutic target in HCL. Here, we investigated the biological and therapeutic importance of the activated BRAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in HCL by exposing in vitro primary leukemic cells purified from 26 patients to clinically available BRAF (vemurafenib; dabrafenib) or MEK (trametinib) inhibitors. Results were validated in vivo in samples from vemurafenib-treated HCL patients within a phase 2 clinical trial. BRAF and MEK inhibitors caused, specifically in HCL (but not HCL-like) cells, marked MEK/ERK dephosphorylation, silencing of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway transcriptional output, loss of the HCL-specific gene expression signature, downregulation of the HCL markers CD25, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and cyclin D1, smoothening of leukemic cells' hairy surface, and, eventually, apoptosis. Apoptosis was partially blunted by coculture with bone marrow stromal cells antagonizing MEK-ERK dephosphorylation. This protective effect could be counteracted by combined BRAF and MEK inhibition. Our results strongly support and inform the clinical use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in HCL.","['Pettirossi, Valentina', 'Santi, Alessia', 'Imperi, Elisa', 'Russo, Guido', 'Pucciarini, Alessandra', 'Bigerna, Barbara', 'Schiavoni, Gianluca', 'Fortini, Elisabetta', 'Spanhol-Rosseto, Ariele', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Mannucci, Roberta', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Tiacci, Enrico']","['Pettirossi V', 'Santi A', 'Imperi E', 'Russo G', 'Pucciarini A', 'Bigerna B', 'Schiavoni G', 'Fortini E', 'Spanhol-Rosseto A', 'Sportoletti P', 'Mannucci R', 'Martelli MP', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Falini B', 'Tiacci E']","['Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Internal Medicine and Oncologic Sciences, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Biochip Laboratory, Institute for Cell Biology-Tumor Research, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.', 'Institute of Hematology, and.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141205,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4366655,,,2014/12/07 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/12/07 06:00'],"['2014/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35239-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-603100 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 19;125(8):1207-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-603100.

We review the probabilistic mathematical methods used to analyze stochastics and give two specific examples. The first example concerns a treatment protocol, e.g., for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where intermittent cytotoxic drug dosing (e.g., once each weekday) is used with intent to cure. We argue mathematically that, if independent SLCC are growing stochastically during prolonged treatment, then, other things being equal, front-loading doses are more effective for tumor eradication than back loading. We also argue that the interacting SLCC dynamics during treatment is often best modeled by considering SLCC in microenvironmental niches, with SLCC-SLCC interactions occurring only among SLCC within the same niche, and we present a stochastic dynamics formalism, involving ""Poissonization,"" applicable in such situations. Interactions at a distance due to partial control of total cell numbers are also considered. The second half of this chapter concerns chromosomal aberrations, lesions known to cause some leukemias. A specific example is the induction of a Philadelphia chromosome by ionizing radiation, subsequent development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), CML treatment, and treatment outcome. This time evolution involves a coordinated sequence of > 10 steps, each stochastic in its own way, at the subatomic, molecular, macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and population scales, with corresponding time scales ranging from picoseconds to decades. We discuss models of these steps and progress in integrating models across scales.","['Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Li, Huamin', 'Sachs, Rainer K']","['Radivoyevitch T', 'Li H', 'Sachs RK']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA, radivot@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,,,2014/12/07 06:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2014/12/07 06:00'],"['2014/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-2095-2_16 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2014;844:317-46. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-2095-2_16.,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Stochastic Processes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this chapter, we consider the dynamics of drug resistance in blood cancer and the related issue of the dynamics of cancer stem cells. After describing the main types of chemotherapeutic agents available for cancer treatment, we review the different mechanisms of drug resistance development. Various mathematical models of drug resistance found in the literature are then reviewed. Given the well-known hierarchy of the hematopoietic system, it is critical to focus on those cells that have the ability to self-renew, since these will be the only cells able to induce long-term drug resistance. Thus, a recent mathematical model taking into account the complex dynamics of the leukemic stem-like cells is described. The chapter closes with a few applications of this model to chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Tomasetti, Cristian']",['Tomasetti C'],"['Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, 550 North Broadway, Suite 1103, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA, ctomasez@johnshopkins.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,,,2014/12/07 06:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2014/12/07 06:00'],"['2014/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-2095-2_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2014;844:303-16. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-2095-2_15.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas the stochastic models work in situations where chance dominates, for example when the number of cells is small, or under random mutations, the deterministic models are more important for large-scale, normal hematopoiesis. New types of models are on the horizon. These models attempt to account for distributed environments such as hematopoietic niches and their impact on dynamics. Mixed effects of such structures and chance events are largely unknown and constitute both a challenge and promise for modeling. Our discussion is presented under the separate headings of deterministic and stochastic modeling; however, the connections between both are frequently mentioned. Four case studies are included to elucidate important examples. We also include a primer of deterministic and stochastic dynamics for the reader's use.","['Kimmel, Marek']",['Kimmel M'],"['Department of Statistics and Bioengineering, Rice University, 2102 Duncan Hall, 6100 Main St., 77005, Houston, TX, USA, kimmel@rice.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,,,2014/12/07 06:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2014/12/07 06:00'],"['2014/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-2095-2_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2014;844:119-52. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-2095-2_7.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Feedback, Physiological', '*Genetic Determinism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Stochastic Processes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we explored targeted re-sequencing as a novel strategy to assess the mutation status of genes with prognostic potential. To this end, we utilized HaloPlex targeted enrichment technology and designed a panel including nine genes: ATM, BIRC3, MYD88, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53, which have been linked to the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and KLHL6, POT1 and XPO1, which are less characterized but were found to be recurrently mutated in various sequencing studies. A total of 188 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with poor prognostic features (unmutated IGHV, n=137; IGHV3-21 subset #2, n=51) were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 and data were analyzed using well-established bioinformatics tools. Using a conservative cutoff of 10% for the mutant allele, we found that 114/180 (63%) patients carried at least one mutation, with mutations in ATM, BIRC3, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53 accounting for 149/177 (84%) of all mutations. We selected 155 mutations for Sanger validation (variant allele frequency, 10-99%) and 93% (144/155) of mutations were confirmed; notably, all 11 discordant variants had a variant allele frequency between 11-27%, hence at the detection limit of conventional Sanger sequencing. Technical precision was assessed by repeating the entire HaloPlex procedure for 63 patients; concordance was found for 77/82 (94%) mutations. In summary, this study demonstrates that targeted next-generation sequencing is an accurate and reproducible technique potentially suitable for routine screening, eventually as a stand-alone test without the need for confirmation by Sanger sequencing.","['Sutton, Lesley-Ann', 'Ljungstrom, Viktor', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Young, Emma', 'Cortese, Diego', 'Navrkalova, Veronika', 'Malcikova, Jitka', 'Muggen, Alice F', 'Trbusek, Martin', 'Panagiotidis, Panagiotis', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Sutton LA', 'Ljungstrom V', 'Mansouri L', 'Young E', 'Cortese D', 'Navrkalova V', 'Malcikova J', 'Muggen AF', 'Trbusek M', 'Panagiotidis P', 'Davi F', 'Belessi C', 'Langerak AW', 'Ghia P', 'Pospisilova S', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'First Department of Propaedeutic Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Nikea General Hospital, Pireaus, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy Division of Molecular Oncology and Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

Adoptive immunotherapies, which have shown promise in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, have the potential to target acute myeloid leukemia through pathways that are distinct and complementary to current approaches. Here, we describe the development of a novel adoptive immunotherapy specific for this disease. We generated a second generation CD33-specific chimeric antigen receptor capable of redirecting cytolytic effector T cells against leukemic cells. CD33 is expressed in approximately 90% of acute myeloid leukemia cases and has demonstrated utility as a target of therapeutic antibodies. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells efficiently killed leukemia cell lines and primary tumor cells in vitro. The anti-leukemia effect was CD33-specific, mediated through T-cell effector functions, and displayed tumor lysis at effector:target ratios as low as 1:20. Furthermore, the CD33-redirected T cells were effective in vivo, preventing the development of leukemia after prophylactic administration and delaying the progression of established disease in mice. These data provide pre-clinical validation of the effectiveness of a second-generation anti-CD33 chimeric antigen receptor therapy for acute myeloid leukemia, and support its continued development as a clinical therapeutic.","[""O'Hear, Carol"", 'Heiber, Joshua F', 'Schubert, Ingo', 'Fey, Georg', 'Geiger, Terrence L']","[""O'Hear C"", 'Heiber JF', 'Schubert I', 'Fey G', 'Geiger TL']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Oncology, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Pathology, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'University of Erlangen, Department of Biology, Germany.', 'University of Erlangen, Department of Biology, Germany.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Pathology, Memphis, TN, USA terrence.geiger@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141205,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC4349272,,,2014/12/07 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2014/12/07 06:00'],"['2014/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.112748 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.112748 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Mar;100(3):336-44. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.112748.

METHODS: All respective donors were HLA-identical siblings. All patients received CSA at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day starting on day -1. A CSA level of 80-130 ng/ml was aimed for. The 43 patients in the historical control were given an additional 10 mg/m(2) dosage of MTX on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. RESULTS: Patients who received CSA alone had a significantly reduced cumulative incidence of relapse (5 vs. 40 %; p = 0.002), a significantly increased 5-year event-free survival (84 vs. 35 %; p = 0.001), and a significantly increased 5-year overall survival (84 vs. 42 %; p = 0.004).

CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, post-transplant immunosuppression consisting of CSA alone is well tolerated and may contribute to a superior outcome.","['Weiss, Melissa', 'Steinbach, Daniel', 'Zintl, Felix', 'Beck, James', 'Gruhn, Bernd']","['Weiss M', 'Steinbach D', 'Zintl F', 'Beck J', 'Gruhn B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Kochstrasse 2, 07740, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141206,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,,,2014/12/07 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/12/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1885-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Jun;141(6):1089-94. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1885-y.

We present a Drosophila model of paternal-diet-induced intergenerational metabolic reprogramming (IGMR) and identify genes required for its encoding in offspring. Intriguingly, we find that as little as 2 days of dietary intervention in fathers elicits obesity in offspring. Paternal sugar acts as a physiological suppressor of variegation, desilencing chromatin-state-defined domains in both mature sperm and in offspring embryos. We identify requirements for H3K9/K27me3-dependent reprogramming of metabolic genes in two distinct germline and zygotic windows. Critically, we find evidence that a similar system may regulate obesity susceptibility and phenotype variation in mice and humans. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying intergenerational metabolic reprogramming and carry profound implications for our understanding of phenotypic variation and evolution.","['Ost, Anita', 'Lempradl, Adelheid', 'Casas, Eduard', 'Weigert, Melanie', 'Tiko, Theodor', 'Deniz, Merdin', 'Pantano, Lorena', 'Boenisch, Ulrike', 'Itskov, Pavel M', 'Stoeckius, Marlon', 'Ruf, Marius', 'Rajewsky, Nikolaus', 'Reuter, Gunter', 'Iovino, Nicola', 'Ribeiro, Carlos', 'Alenius, Mattias', 'Heyne, Steffen', 'Vavouri, Tanya', 'Pospisilik, J Andrew']","['Ost A', 'Lempradl A', 'Casas E', 'Weigert M', 'Tiko T', 'Deniz M', 'Pantano L', 'Boenisch U', 'Itskov PM', 'Stoeckius M', 'Ruf M', 'Rajewsky N', 'Reuter G', 'Iovino N', 'Ribeiro C', 'Alenius M', 'Heyne S', 'Vavouri T', 'Pospisilik JA']","['Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.

A precise molecular diagnosis of PMBL can be achieved by gene expression profiling. The signature gene expression profile of PMBL is more closely related to classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) than to other DLBCL subgroups. A number of common genetic aberrations in PMBL and cHL further underscore their close relationship. To investigate the pathobiology of lymphomas in depth, many groups have turned to cell lines that are suitable models facilitating molecular studies and providing unique insights. For the purposes of the current perspective, we focus on four bona fide PMBL-derived cell lines (FARAGE, KARPAS-1106, MEDB-1, U-2940) that we identified and validated as such through hierarchical cluster analysis among a large collection of leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. These gene expression profiles showed that the four PMBL cell lines represent a distinct entity and are most similar to cHL cell lines, confirming derivation from a related cell type. A validated cell line resource for PMBL should assist those seeking druggable targets in this entity. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available cellular models for the study of PMBL.","['Drexler, Hans G', 'Ehrentraut, Stefan', 'Nagel, Stefan', 'Eberth, Sonja', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F']","['Drexler HG', 'Ehrentraut S', 'Nagel S', 'Eberth S', 'MacLeod RA']","['Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Dept.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the incidence and recurrence rate of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: NMSC incidence was calculated and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations with risk of recurrence for patients with NHL between 1976 and 2005 who were in the Rochester Epidemiology Project research infrastructure. RESULTS: We identified 282 patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma and 435 with non-CLL NHL. The incidence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma was 1829.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1306.7-2491.1) and 2224.9 (95% CI 1645.9-2941.6), respectively, in patients with CLL. The cumulative recurrence rate at 8 years after treatment with Mohs micrographic surgery was 8.3% (95% CI 0.0%-22.7%) for basal cell carcinoma and 13.4% (95% CI 0.0%-25.5%) for squamous cell carcinoma in patients with CLL. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective cohort study. CONCLUSIONS: After Mohs micrographic surgery and standard excision of NMSC, patients with NHL had a skin cancer recurrence rate that was higher than expected. Careful treatment and monitoring of patients with NHL and NMSC are warranted.","['Brewer, Jerry D', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Khezri, Farzaneh', 'Sosa Seda, Ivette M', 'Zubair, Adeel S', 'Baum, Christian L', 'Arpey, Christopher J', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Roenigk, Randall K', 'Smith, Carin Y', 'Weaver, Amy L', 'Otley, Clark C']","['Brewer JD', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Khezri F', 'Sosa Seda IM', 'Zubair AS', 'Baum CL', 'Arpey CJ', 'Cerhan JR', 'Call TG', 'Roenigk RK', 'Smith CY', 'Weaver AL', 'Otley CC']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

In contrast, tamoxifen induced proliferation of quiescent long-term HSCs, altered the expression of self-renewal genes, and compromised hematopoietic reconstitution after myelotoxic stress, which was reversible. In mice, tamoxifen treatment blocked development of JAK2(V617F)-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm in vivo, induced apoptosis of human JAK2(V617F+) HSPCs in a xenograft model, and sensitized MLL-AF9(+) leukemias to chemotherapy. Apoptosis was selectively observed in mutant cells, and tamoxifen treatment only had a minor impact on steady-state hematopoiesis in disease-free animals.

Selective targeting of LSCs is a promising approach for treating AML and preventing relapse following chemotherapy, and developing such therapeutic modalities is a key priority. Here, we show that targeting telomerase activity eradicates AML LSCs. Genetic deletion of the telomerase subunit Terc in a retroviral mouse AML model induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of LSCs, and depletion of telomerase-deficient LSCs is partially rescued by p53 knockdown. Murine Terc(-/-) LSCs express a specific gene expression signature that can be identified in human AML patient cohorts and is positively correlated with patient survival following chemotherapy.

Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab is generally considered a standard treatment for younger fit patients with CLL. In a recent randomized Phase III study of patients with newly diagnosed CLL and coexisting conditions, obinutuzumab, a humanized anti-CD20 glycoengineered type 2 antibody, used in combination with chlorambucil, demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival and several other outcome parameters, in comparison to rituximab plus chlorambucil. Grade 3-4 infusion-related reactions and neutropenia occurred more frequently in patients who received obinutuzumab compared with those who received rituximab; however, the rate of serious infections was similar. Results of this trial clearly established that obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil represent the new first-line standard of treatment in this setting. A broad range of novel agents with different mechanisms of action have already proven their efficacy in CLL. New drugs targeting specific molecular features, such as ibrutinib, idelalisib or ABT-199, are being tested at present, and their advent is very likely to change the future treatment paradigm of CLL that relies today on chemoimmunotherapy for both fit and elderly/unfit patients.","['Molica, Stefano']",['Molica S'],"['Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, viale Pio X, Catanzaro 88100, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141205,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'elderly', 'obinutuzumab', 'unfit patients']",2014/12/06 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/14737140.2015.990442 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2015 Jan;15(1):9-15. doi: 10.1586/14737140.2015.990442.

To reduce this bias, we performed a decision analysis focusing on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission (CR1). The primary outcome measure was 5-year survival probability with or without quality-of-life (QOL) adjustment. A baseline analysis showed that the decision to perform MUD transplantation was superior to that to perform RD/1AGMM-GVH transplantation for patients with AML or ALL. However, in the ALL cohort, the direction of superiority was reversed when the interval between CR1 and 8/8 MUD transplantation was >5.5 months (without QOL adjustment) or >6 months (after QOL adjustment) or when overall survival of RD/1AGMM-GVH transplantation improved by 1.3% without QOL adjustment and 2.1% after QOL adjustment. In conclusion, 8/8 MUD should be prioritized in transplantation for AML and ALL in CR1. However, the MUD coordination period and improvements in RD/1AGMM-GVH transplantation might change the donor selection priority in transplantation for ALL in CR1.","['Kanda, J', 'Fuji, S', 'Kato, S', 'Takami, A', 'Tanaka, J', 'Miyamura, K', 'Ohashi, K', 'Fukuda, T', 'Ozawa, Y', 'Kanamori, H', 'Eto, T', 'Kobayashi, N', 'Iwato, K', 'Morishima, Y', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Atsuta, Y', 'Kanda, Y']","['Kanda J', 'Fuji S', 'Kato S', 'Takami A', 'Tanaka J', 'Miyamura K', 'Ohashi K', 'Fukuda T', 'Ozawa Y', 'Kanamori H', 'Eto T', 'Kobayashi N', 'Iwato K', 'Morishima Y', 'Sakamaki H', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Transplantation & Regenerative Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Data Management and Biostatistics, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141205,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,PMC4315891,,,2014/12/06 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201485 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2014.85 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 Dec 5;4:e263. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2014.85.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Donor Selection/*methods', 'Female', '*HLA Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', '*Unrelated Donors']",['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,"['HLA Working Group', 'Donor/Source Working Group', 'Adult AML Working Group', 'Adult ALL Working Group of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell', 'Transplantation']",,,,,,

Thus, perhaps it is not surprising that miRNAs serve as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in hematologic malignancies arising from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, such as the myeloid disorders. A number of studies have extensively documented the widespread dysregulation of miRNA expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), inspiring numerous explorations of the functional role of miRNAs in myeloid leukemogenesis. While these investigations have confirmed that a large number of miRNAs exhibit altered expression in AML, only a small fraction has been confirmed as functional mediators of AML development or maintenance. Herein, we summarize the miRNAs for which strong experimental evidence supports their functional roles in AML pathogenesis. We also discuss the implications of these studies on the development of miRNA-directed therapies in AML.","['Khalaj, Mona', 'Tavakkoli, Montreh', 'Stranahan, Alec W', 'Park, Christopher Y']","['Khalaj M', 'Tavakkoli M', 'Stranahan AW', 'Park CY']","['Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University NY, USA ; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center NY, USA.', 'Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University NY, USA ; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center NY, USA.', 'Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University NY, USA ; Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center NY, USA ; Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141119,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC4237136,['NOTNLM'],"['hematologic malignancies', 'hematopoiesis', 'leukemia', 'leukemogensis', 'microRNAs']",2014/12/06 06:00,2014/12/06 06:01,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2014.00361 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2014 Nov 19;5:361. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2014.00361. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,"['R01 CA164120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA020449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008539/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective treatment of CLL by chlorambucil and bendamustine leads to the restoration of renal function. In this contribution, we sought to elucidate the impact of organic anion transporters (OATs) on the uptake of bendamustine and chlorambucil as a probable reason for the superior efficacy of bendamustine over chlorambucil in the treatment of CLL. We examined the effects of structural analogs of p-aminohippurate (PAH), melphalan, chlorambucil, and bendamustine, on OAT1-mediated [(3)H]PAH uptake and OAT3- and OAT4-mediated [(3)H]estrone sulfate (ES) uptake in stably transfected human embryonic kidney-293 cells. Melphalan had no significant inhibitory effect on any OAT, whereas chlorambucil reduced OAT1-, OAT3-, and OAT4-mediated uptake of PAH or ES down to 14.6%, 16.3%, and 66.0% of control, respectively. Bendamustine inhibited only OAT3-mediated ES uptake, which was reduced down to 14.3% of control cells, suggesting that it interacts exclusively with OAT3. The IC50 value for OAT3 was calculated to be 0.8 muM. Real-time PCR experiments demonstrated a high expression of OAT3 in lymphoma cell lines as well as primary CLL cells. OAT3-mediated accumulation of bendamustine was associated with reduced cell proliferation and an increased rate of apoptosis. We conclude that the high efficacy of bendamustine in treating CLL might be partly contributed to the expression of OAT3 in lymphoma cells and the high affinity of bendamustine for this transporter.","['Hagos, Yohannes', 'Hundertmark, Philip', 'Shnitsar, Volodymyr', 'Marada, Venkata V V R', 'Wulf, Gerald', 'Burckhardt, Gerhard']","['Hagos Y', 'Hundertmark P', 'Shnitsar V', 'Marada VV', 'Wulf G', 'Burckhardt G']","['Institut fur Vegetative Physiologie und Pathophysiologie, Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; and yohannes.hagos@med.uni-goettingen.de.', 'Institut fur Vegetative Physiologie und Pathophysiologie, Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; and.', 'Institut fur Vegetative Physiologie und Pathophysiologie, Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; and.', 'Institut fur Vegetative Physiologie und Pathophysiologie, Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; and.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institut fur Vegetative Physiologie und Pathophysiologie, Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; and.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141204,United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The defect in transmission of signals from various types of extracellular receptors, leading to aberrant cytokines and transcription factors gene expression, may underlie the basis of immune failure in B-CLL. The aim of the study was to assess of IL-6, IL-10, c-Jun, and STAT3 expression. In response to antigenic stimulation IL-6, IL-10, c-Jun, and STAT3 proteins induce mutual activity. The subject of the study was subpopulations of leukemic lymphocytes (CD5+ CD19+) and CD19+ B cells from healthy donors (control group). Our results provide evidence that the regulation of IL-6, IL-10, c-Jun, and STAT3 gene expression in CLL B cells is clearly different from normal B lymphocytes. In B-CLL STAT3 expression in unstimulated lymphocytes is significantly higher (p<0.0001) compared with normal subpopulation of B cell. In contrast, IL-6, IL-10, and c-Jun mRNA expressions are statistically lower in B-CLL in comparison with the control group, in all cases (p<0.0001). When analyzing the relationship between c-Jun expression and B-CLL stage according Rai we revealed decreasing c-Jun expression, both at the mRNA and protein levels, along with advancing stage of disease.","['Antosz, Halina', 'Wojciechowska, Katarzyna', 'Sajewicz, Joanna', 'Choroszynska, Dorota', 'Marzec-Kotarska, Barbara', 'Osiak, Magdalena', 'Pajak, Natalia', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Jargiello-Baszak, Malgorzata', 'Baszak, Jacek']","['Antosz H', 'Wojciechowska K', 'Sajewicz J', 'Choroszynska D', 'Marzec-Kotarska B', 'Osiak M', 'Pajak N', 'Tomczak W', 'Jargiello-Baszak M', 'Baszak J']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1 719 617 hospitalizations for 1 531 828 unique patients in 58 children's hospitals from 2009 to 2011 from the Children's Hospital Association Case-Mix Comparative database were examined. Main outcome measures included rates, diagnoses, and costs of potentially preventable readmissions (PPRs) and all-cause readmissions. RESULTS: The 7-, 15-, and 30-day rates by 3M-PPRs were 2.5%, 4.1%, and 6.2%, respectively. Corresponding all-cause readmission rates were 5.0%, 8.7%, and 13.3%. At 30 days, 60.6% of all-cause readmissions were considered nonpreventable by 3M-PPRs, more than one-half of which were related to malignancies. The percentage of readmissions rated as potentially preventable was similar at all 3 time intervals. Readmissions after chemotherapy, acute leukemia, and cystic fibrosis were all considered nonpreventable, and at least 80% of readmissions after index admissions for sickle cell crisis, bronchiolitis, ventricular shunt procedures, asthma, and appendectomy were designated potentially preventable. Total costs for all readmissions were $1.7 billion; PPRs accounted for 27.3% of these costs. The most costly readmissions were associated with ventricular shunt procedures ($26.5 million/year), seizures ($15.5 million/year), and sickle cell crisis ($15.0 million/year). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of PPRs were significantly lower than all-cause readmission rates more than one-half of which were caused by exclusion of malignancies. Annual costs of PPRs, although significant in the aggregate, appear to represent a much smaller cost-savings opportunity for children than for adults. Our study may help guide children's hospitals to focus readmission reduction strategies on areas where the financial vulnerability is greatest based on 3M-PPRs.","['Gay, James C', 'Agrawal, Rishi', 'Auger, Katherine A', 'Del Beccaro, Mark A', 'Eghtesady, Pirooz', 'Fieldston, Evan S', 'Golias, Justin', 'Hain, Paul D', 'McClead, Richard', 'Morse, Rustin B', 'Neuman, Mark I', 'Simon, Harold K', 'Tejedor-Sojo, Javier', 'Teufel, Ronald J 2nd', 'Harris, J Mitchell 2nd', 'Shah, Samir S']","['Gay JC', 'Agrawal R', 'Auger KA', 'Del Beccaro MA', 'Eghtesady P', 'Fieldston ES', 'Golias J', 'Hain PD', 'McClead R', 'Morse RB', 'Neuman MI', 'Simon HK', 'Tejedor-Sojo J', 'Teufel RJ 2nd', 'Harris JM 2nd', 'Shah SS']","['Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.

METHOD: Two cases of SAP with ARDS were monitored using PiCCO during comprehensive management in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University. To guide fluid management, the cardiac index (CI) was measured to assess cardiac function, the global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) was used to evaluate cardiac preload, and the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) was used to evaluate the pulmonary edema. RESULT: Case 1 was diagnosed with type L2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (intermediate risk) and received the sixth maintenance phases of chemotherapy this time. After a 1-week dosage of chemotherapeutic drugs (pegaspargase and mitoxantrone), he suffered SAP combined with ARDS. Except comprehensive treatment (life supporting, antibiotic, etc.) and applying continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) to remove inflammatory mediators. PiCCO monitor was utilized to guide fluid management. During the early stage of PiCCO monitoring, the patient showed no significant manifestations of pulmonary edema in the bedside chest X-ray (bedside ultrasound showed left pleural effusion), and had an oxygenation index 223 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), GEDVI 450 ml/m(2), and ELVWI 7 ml/kg. We increased cardiac output to increase tissue perfusion and dehydration speed of CVVHDF was set at 70 ml/h. Two hours later, GEDVI significantly increased to 600 ml/m(2) and ELVWI significantly increased to 10 ml/kg, the oxygenation index declined to 155 mmHg, the bedside chest X-ray showed a significant decrease of permeability (right lung) and PEEP was adjusted to 5 cmH(2)O (1 cmH(2)O = 0.098 kPa), indicating circulating overload. ARDS subsequently occurred, upon which the fluid infusion was halted, the dehydration rate of CVVHDF raised (adjusted to 100-200 ml/h). On day 3 in the PICU, EVLWI dropped to 6 ml/kg, GEDVI dropped to 370 ml/m(2), and the oxygenation index increased to 180 mmHg. On day 8, the patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator. However, on day 9, the patient reverted to mechanical ventilation due to secondary infection. On day 30, the patient was discharged for voluntarily giving up treatment. Late follow-up results showed that the patient was dead one day after giving up treatment. Case 2 was admitted due to SAP induced by overeating one day before admission. On day 2, the patient showed dyspnea and oxygen saturation decreased to 80%. We applied mechanical ventilation, CVVHDF to remove inflammatory mediators and PiCCO to guide fluid management. According to the initial data of PiCCO, EVLWI was 9 ml/kg, GEDVI was 519 ml/m(2), the oxygenation index was 298 mmHg, the bedside chest X-ray showed decreased permeability and PEEP was adjusted to 5 cmH(2)O, suggesting the existence of ARDS. During treatment, the dehydration speed of CVVHDF was set at 50 ml/h to maintain the balance of fluid input and output. Two hours after PiCCO monitoring, the oxygenation index decreased to 140 mmHg, GEDVI 481 ml/m(2), EVLWI 9 ml/kg, thus the dehydration speed of CVVHDF was increased (up to 100 ml/h). On day 4 in the PICU, EVLWI was 9 ml/kg, GEDVI was 430 ml/m(2), oxygenation index was 394 mmHg, and the bedside chest X-ray showed that permeability was higher. On day 5, the patient was transferred from PiCCO. On day 30, the patient recovered and was discharged. CONCLUSION: PiCCO monitoring can provide real-time surveillance of cardiac function, cardiac preload and afterload, and extravascular lung water in pediatric patients with SAP combined with ARDS. These results are clinically significant for the rescue of critically ill patients with ARDS or shock.","['Yan, Weiyuan', 'Wang, Lijie']","['Yan W', 'Wang L']","['Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, China.

METHOD: Eight tertiary referral centers for childhood cancer participated in this study. From April 2009 to March 2012, 104 patients below 18 years with newly diagnosed, untreated B-NHL or mature B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were enrolled. Six patients refused further staging work-up and treatment due to the expense were excluded. Diagnostic slides were not centrally reviewed in this retrospective study. Twenty-three of 104 patients got rituximab therapy during the treatment. RESULT: Of the 104 eligible patients (79 boys and 25 girls), the median age was 6.1 years (range 1.8-15.1 years). Two patients (1.9%) had stage I disease, 22 (21.2%) had stage II, 65 (62.5%) had stage III, 9 (8.6%) had stage IV, and 6 (5.8%) had B-ALL. At a median follow-up of 27.9 months (range 4.2-51.5 months), the 2-year probability of event-free survival (EFS) was (76.0 +/- 4.3)% in all patients. The 2-year EFS was 100%, (93.3 +/- 6.4) %, (75.1 +/- 5.4) % and (52.5 +/- 13.1) % for patients with stage I, II, III and IV/B-ALL, respectively (P = 0.03). There was no significant difference in EFS between patients treated with chemotherapy only and those with chemotherapy combined with rituximab [(76.1 +/- 4.8)% vs. (75.9 +/- 9.6)%, P > 0.05]. The 2-year EFS was (84.5 +/- 4.8)%, (70.6 +/- 11.1)% and (58.0 +/- 10.1)% for patients with LDH < 2 times the institutional upper limit of normal (2 times NL), 2-4 times NL and > 4 times NL, respectively (P = 0.02). Only one patient (1%, 1/104) died of treatment-related complications. Six patients refused treatment during therapy. Including the 6 cases who refused to receive further staging diagnostic workup, the abandonment rate for B-NHL/B-ALL was 10.9% (12/110). CONCLUSION: The EFS rate in this study was much lower in patients with advanced disease (LDH > 4 times NL, stage IV and B-ALL) than that of series conducted in medically developed countries.

In particular, a wide variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are volatized or released into the atmosphere and can become ubiquitous, as they originate from many different natural and anthropogenic sources, such as paints, pesticides, vehicle exhausts, cooking fumes, and tobacco smoke. Humans may be exposed to VOCs through inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact, which may increase the risk of leukemia, birth defects, neurocognitive impairment, and cancer. Therefore, the focus of this study was the development of a simple, effective and rapid sample preparation method for the simultaneous determination of seven metabolites (6 mercaptic acids+t,t-muconic acid) derived from five VOCs (acrylamide, 1,3-butadiene, acrylonitrile, benzene, and xylene) in human urine by using automated on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). An aliquot of each diluted urinary sample was directly injected into an autosampler through a trap column to reduce contamination, and then the retained target compounds were eluted by back-flush mode into an analytical column for separation. Negative electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was utilized for quantification. The coefficients of correlation (r(2)) for the calibration curves were greater than 0.995. Reproducibility was assessed by the precision and accuracy of intra-day and inter-day precision, which showed results for coefficient of variation (CV) that were low 0.9 to 6.6% and 3.7 to 8.5%, respectively, and results for recovery that ranged from 90.8 to 108.9% and 92.1 to 107.7%, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were determined to within 0.010 to 0.769 ng mL(-1) and 0.033 to 2.564 ng mL(-1) in this study. A stability study test included 3 freeze/thaw cycles during short-term storage at room temperature for 36 h and long-term storage at -20 degrees C for 1 month, and the CV (coefficient of variation) showed less than 8.4, 7.4 and 9.7%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide simple, small injection volumes (40 microL) and a rapid LC-MS/MS method combined with an on-line SPE step for the simultaneous detection, identification, and quantification of seven metabolites derived from five VOCs in human urine for evaluation of the future risk of human exposure to volatile organic compounds.","['Chiang, Wen-Chieh', 'Chen, Chao-Yu', 'Lee, Ting-Chen', 'Lee, Hui-Ling', 'Lin, Yu-Wen']","['Chiang WC', 'Chen CY', 'Lee TC', 'Lee HL', 'Lin YW']","['Department of Chemistry, Fu Jen Catholic University, Xinzhuang Dist, New Taipei City 24205, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Fu Jen Catholic University, Xinzhuang Dist, New Taipei City 24205, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Fu Jen Catholic University, Xinzhuang Dist, New Taipei City 24205, Taiwan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Fu Jen Catholic University, Xinzhuang Dist, New Taipei City 24205, Taiwan.

Several Authors have determined gene expression profiles by microarray analysis in DS and/or non-DS AMKL. Due to the rarity of AMKL, these studies were typically limited to a small group of samples. METHODS: We generated integrated quantitative transcriptome maps by systematic meta-analysis from any available gene expression profile dataset related to AMKL in pediatric age. This task has been accomplished using a tool recently described by us for the generation and the analysis of quantitative transcriptome maps, TRAM (Transcriptome Mapper), which allows effective integration of data obtained from different experimenters, experimental platforms and data sources. This allowed us to explore gene expression changes involved in transition from normal megakaryocytes (MK, n=19) to DS (n=43) or non-DS (n=45) AMKL blasts, including the analysis of Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder (TMD, n=20), a pre-leukemia condition. RESULTS: We propose a biological model of the transcriptome depicting progressive changes from MK to TMD and then to DS AMKL. The data indicate the repression of genes involved in MK differentiation, in particular the cluster on chromosome 4 including PF4 (platelet factor 4) and PPBP (pro-platelet basic protein); the gene for the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP3K10 and the thrombopoietin receptor gene MPL. Moreover, comparing both DS and non-DS AMKL with MK, we identified three potential clinical markers of progression to AMKL: TMEM241 (transmembrane protein 241) was the most over-expressed single gene, while APOC2 (apolipoprotein C-II) and ZNF587B (zinc finger protein 587B) appear to be the most discriminant markers of progression, specifically to DS AMKL. Finally, the chromosome 21 (chr21) genes resulted to be the most over-expressed in DS and non-DS AMKL, as well as in TMD, pointing out a key role of chr21 genes in differentiating AMKL from MK. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents an integrated original model of the DS AMLK transcriptome, providing the identification of genes relevant for its pathophysiology which can potentially be new clinical markers.","['Pelleri, Maria Chiara', 'Piovesan, Allison', 'Caracausi, Maria', 'Berardi, Anna Concetta', 'Vitale, Lorenza', 'Strippoli, Pierluigi']","['Pelleri MC', 'Piovesan A', 'Caracausi M', 'Berardi AC', 'Vitale L', 'Strippoli P']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), Unit of Histology, Embryology and Applied Biology, University of Bologna, Via Belmeloro 8, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy. mariachiara.pelleri2@unibo.it.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), Unit of Histology, Embryology and Applied Biology, University of Bologna, Via Belmeloro 8, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy. allison.piovesan2@unibo.it.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), Unit of Histology, Embryology and Applied Biology, University of Bologna, Via Belmeloro 8, 40126, Bologna, BO, Italy. maria.caracausi2@unibo.it.', ""Research Laboratory Stem Cells, U.O.C.

Imatinib has undoubtedly revolutionised the management and outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), however imatinib resistance has been recognized as a major problem in CML therapy. In this study, we first established imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells, and then evaluated the effect of Adiponectin in reversing imatinib resistance. The data presented here demonstrated that Adiponectin was able to reverse K562 resistance to imatinib in vitro and in vivo. Additional data with molecular approaches suggested that the reversion of Adiponectin in imatinib resistance signals through AdipoR1 but not AdipoR2 to downregulate Bcr-Abl expression and effect in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells. Taken together, our data showed that Adiponectin can reverse imatinib resistance in CML, and to a certain extent elucidate the mechanism of Adiponectin reversing imatinib resistance that may provide a new and promising approach in imatinib resistance management in CML therapy.","['Wu, Shenghao', 'Zheng, Cuiping', 'Chen, Songyan', 'Lin, Bijing', 'Chen, Yuemiao', 'Zhou, Wenjin', 'Li, Zhenyu']","['Wu S', 'Zheng C', 'Chen S', 'Lin B', 'Chen Y', 'Zhou W', 'Li Z']","['Department of Hematology, The Dingli Clinical Institute of Wenzhou Medical University (Wenzhou Central Hospital), Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.

It commonly affects children and young adults and is an aggressive disease that is poorly understood with no known biologic markers that can predict prognosis. The systemic form of TNKLPD includes chronic active EBV infection of T/NK type, aggressive NK cell leukemia and systemic EBV + T-cell lymphoproliferative disease of childhood. METHODS: In this study, we analyse the clinicopathologic and genetic features of 22 cases of systemic TNKLPD in non-immunocompromised patients, including chronic active EBV infection of T/NK cell type and systemic EBV + T-cell lymphoproliferative disease of childhood. We also performed gene expression profiling in a subset of cases to identify markers that may be of prognostic relevance and validated our results using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The median age is 14.9 years and two of our 22 cases occurring in patients older than 30 years. Fifteen of 17 cases (88%) with adequate data were of T-cell origin. Eleven of 22 cases revealed polymorphic cellular infiltrate (P-group) while the rest showed monomorphic lymphoid infiltrate (M-group). We found a significant difference in survival between P-group vs M-group patients with median survival not yet reached in P-group, and 1 month in M-group (p = 0.0001), suggesting a role for morphology in predicting patient outcome. We also performed gene expression profiling in a subset of patients and compared the genes differentially expressed between P-group and M-group cases to identify markers of prognostic value. We identified cyclin E2 gene and protein to be differentially expressed between patients with good outcome (P-group, median expression 8%) and poor outcome (M-group, median expression 42%) (p = 0.0005). In addition, the upregulation of cyclin E2 protein in M-group cases correlated with a higher Ki67 proliferation rate (Pearson correlation r = 0.73, p = 0.0006) detected by immunohistochemistry. High cyclin E2 expression was also significantly associated with shorter survival (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests the potential role of monomorphic morphology, high cyclin E2 and Ki67 expression as adverse prognostic factors for TNKLPD.","['Ng, Siok-Bian', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Selvarajan, Viknesvaran', 'Huang, Gaofeng', 'Choo, Shoa-Nian', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Wang, Shi', 'Chua, Hsin-Chieh', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng-Juh', 'Quah, Thuan-Chong', 'Koh, Liang-Piu', 'Tan, Poh-Lin', 'Chng, Wee-Joo']","['Ng SB', 'Ohshima K', 'Selvarajan V', 'Huang G', 'Choo SN', 'Miyoshi H', 'Wang S', 'Chua HC', 'Yeoh AE', 'Quah TC', 'Koh LP', 'Tan PL', 'Chng WJ']","['Department of Pathology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. patnsb@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Hospital, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Main Building, Level 3, Singapore, 119074, Singapore. patnsb@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Asahimati 67, Kurume, 830-0011, Japan. ohshima_kouichi@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. viknesvaran_selvarajan@nuhs.edu.sg.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. g.huang@balliol.oxon.org.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. shoa_nian_choo@nuhs.edu.sg.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, Asahimati 67, Kurume, 830-0011, Japan. h.m-med@hotmail.co.jp.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. shi_wang@nuhs.edu.sg.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. hsinchiehchua@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. allen_yeoh@nuhs.edu.sg.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. thuan_chong_quah@nuhs.edu.sg.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. liang_piu_koh@nuhs.edu.sg.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. poh_lin_tan@nuhs.edu.sg.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, 1E, Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore, 119228, Singapore. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141205,England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,PMC4263108,,,2014/12/06 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13023-014-0165-x [doi]', 's13023-014-0165-x [pii]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2014 Dec 5;9:165. doi: 10.1186/s13023-014-0165-x.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Ki-67 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Singapore', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Young Adult']","['0 (CCNE2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the function and molecular mechanism of YM155 in human oral cancer cells. METHODS: The apoptotic effects and related signaling pathways of YM155 were evaluated using trypan blue exclusion assay, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, Western blotting, RT-PCR, and siRNA. RESULTS: YM155 inhibited the growth and caused caspase-dependent apoptosis in MC3 and HN22 cells. YM155 significantly suppressed the level of survivin protein expression through proteasome-dependent protein degradation to confirm its survivin-inhibiting function. YM155 reduced myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein, but it did not alter Mcl-1 mRNA. It was associated with the facilitation of lysosome-dependent protein degradation. The modifications of Mcl-1 and survivin by YM155 were caspase-independent manner. Treatment of MC-3 and HN22 cells with YM155 inhibited specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and the knockdown of Sp1 by siRNA demonstrated that Mcl-1 was regulated by Sp1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the novel mechanism that YM155 causes apoptosis of human oral cancer cell lines through downregulation of Sp1 and Mcl-1. Therefore, it may be a potential anticancer drug candidate for the treatment of oral cancer.","['Sachita, Khadka', 'Yu, Hyun-Ju', 'Yun, Jun-Won', 'Lee, Jeong-Sang', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Sachita K', 'Yu HJ', 'Yun JW', 'Lee JS', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Institute of Biodegradable Material, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Institute of Biodegradable Material, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea.', 'Department of Experimental Animal Research, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health and Functional Food, College of Medical Science, Jeonju University, Jeonju, Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Institute of Biodegradable Material, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141205,Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,,['NOTNLM'],"['YM155', 'apoptosis', 'myeloid cell leukemia-1', 'oral cancer', 'specificity protein 1']",2014/12/06 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jop.12299 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2015 Nov;44(10):785-91. doi: 10.1111/jop.12299.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of childhood leukaemia in Ibadan. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective study of leukaemia cases diagnosed at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan between January 1991 and December 2010 in children less than 15 years of age. Data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. RESULTS: There were 64 cases of childhood leukaemia, accounting for 10.2% of childhood cancers seen during this study period. The male to female ratio was 2:1 and modal age group was between 10 and 14 years. Thirty (46.9%) cases were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 22 (34.4%) were acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and 12 (18.8%) were unspecified acute leukaemias. There was no case of chronic myeloid or lymphocytic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: There has been a relative increase in the frequency of leukaemia cases at UCH, Ibadan, which may be largely explained by increased awareness and referrals. There is a need for further collaborative multicentre studies of childhood leukaemias in Nigeria and other developing countries and focused research on childhood leukaemias in order to unravel the aetiology.","['Babatunde, T O', 'Ogun, G O', 'Brown, B J', 'Akang, E E', ""Aken'Ova, Y A""]","['Babatunde TO', 'Ogun GO', 'Brown BJ', 'Akang EE', ""Aken'Ova YA""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Nigeria,Afr J Med Med Sci,African journal of medicine and medical sciences,7801013,,,,2014/12/06 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Afr J Med Med Sci. 2014 Jun;43(2):135-8.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven viral forms have been detected. The variability of BLV isolates did not exceed 1% within one form. Despite the recent inhabitation of BLV in Russia in the middle of 20th century, Russian BLV variants are characterized by several specific nucleotide substitutions. Point mutations that result in the changes in the aminoacid sequence of reverse transcriptase of BLV specific to distinct viral forms were observed. C --> G transition at the 2752 position (relatively to the reference genome AF033818), which results in the substitution of glutamic to asparaginic acid (GAG --> GAC), is specific to form BLV-2. This mutation was demonstrated in BLV isolates from Ukraine. The T --> G substitution at the 2758 position, which results in the substitution of isoleucine for methionine (ATT --> ATG), is specific to BLV-4 and BLV-7 forms. The BLV-4 form was only detected in Russia and Ukraine. The present study also includes a review of the published data concerning BLV variability. The existing classifications of BLV forms have been critically conceived and the new optimal classification of BLV forms with the maximal resolution has been suggested.","['Ruzina, M N', 'Andrianov, B V', 'Suprovich, T M', 'Sulimova, G E']","['Ruzina MN', 'Andrianov BV', 'Suprovich TM', 'Sulimova GE']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Genetika,Genetika,0047354,,,,2013/08/01 00:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/12/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7868/s0016675813080134 [doi]'],ppublish,Genetika. 2013 Aug;49(8):975-80. doi: 10.7868/s0016675813080134.,,IM,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', '*Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Phylogeny', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Russia', 'Ukraine']",['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work was designed to assess the cytotoxicity of the methanol crude extracts and compounds from the fruits of Uapaca togoensis, namely, beta-amyryl acetate (1), 11-oxo-alpha-amyryl acetate (2), lupeol (3), pomolic acid (4), futokadsurin B (5), arborinin (6), and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl sitosterol (7) against nine drug sensitive and multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the fruits of U. togoensis and compounds, whilst the caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activation of caspase enzymes by the fruits of U. togoensis and compound 6. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential, and levels of reactive oxygen species were all analyzed via flow cytometry. The acridone alkoid 6 and the crude extract from the fruits of U. togoensis were active on all of the nine tested cancer lines with IC50 values below 32 microM and 30 microg/mL, respectively. Compounds 2 and 5 showed selective activities and IC50 values below 99 microM or 42 microM, respectively, which were obtained towards 3/9 and 6/9 tested cancer cell lines. Compound 6 displayed IC50 values below 10 microM towards seven of the nine tested cancer cell lines. The IC50 values ranged from 3.55 microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 31.77 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) for alkaloid 6 and from 0.20 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 195.12 microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. The crude extract of the fruits of U. togoensis induced apoptosis in the CCRF-CEM leukemia cells, which was mediated by the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Compound 6 also strongly induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells and cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and S phases. The crude extract from the fruits of this plant as well as aborinin are potential antiproliferative natural products that deserve further investigation to develop novel cytotoxic drugs to fight sensitive and otherwise drug-resistant phenotypes.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Sandjo, Louis P', 'Seukep, Jackson A', 'Zeino, Maen', 'Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Ngadjui, Bonaventure', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Sandjo LP', 'Seukep JA', 'Zeino M', 'Mbaveng AT', 'Ngadjui B', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde 1, Yaounde, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141204,Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,,,,2014/12/05 06:00,2015/08/28 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0034-1383362 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2015 Jan;81(1):32-8. doi: 10.1055/s-0034-1383362.

Here, we performed comparative transcriptome analyses in acute myeloid leukemia to investigate the biological implications of HDAC2 silencing versus its enzymatic inhibition using epigenetic-based drug(s). By gene expression analysis of HDAC2-silenced vs wild-type cells, we found that HDAC2 has a specific role in leukemogenesis. Gene expression profiling of U937 cell line with or without treatment of the well-known HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA) identifies and characterizes several gene clusters where inhibition of HDAC2 'mimics' its silencing, as well as those where HDAC2 is selectively and exclusively regulated by HDAC2 protein expression levels.

Other aspects studied included how patients' knowledge of the disease and its treatment influence adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 CML patients were contacted between June 2012 and September 2013 in eight secondary or tertiary care hospitals in Finland. Of these, 86 participated in the study. This covers approximately 20% of all Finnish CML patients. The mean age was 57.8 years and 52% were male. Of the patients, 79.1% were using imatinib, 10.5% dasatinib, and 10.5% nilotinib. The patient-reported adherence (experienced adherence) was evaluated using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). In addition, the treating physicians were asked to give their subjective opinion on their patients' adherence (observed adherence). The experienced adherence was compared with the observed adherence using a three-level rating system (high, medium, low). All patients were personally interviewed and their demographic data collected. The statistical analysis of the data was based on descriptive statistics presented as frequencies, percentages, means, and medians. The kappa coefficient was calculated between the patient's and the doctor's assessment of adherence. RESULTS: A total of 23% (20/86) of the patients were fully adherent according to the MMAS, while physicians evaluated 94% (80/86) of the patients as fully adherent. The physicians' estimate was too optimistic in 73% of cases. The discrepancy was confirmed by a kappa value of -0.004. The patients' knowledge of the disease and its treatment was poor in all adherence levels. CONCLUSION: The patient-reported adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments in Finland was found to be the same as that found in the majority of previous studies. However, there seems to be a very weak agreement between the patient's and the physician's assessment of adherence. This study suggests that physicians overestimate the adherence of CML patients and base their assessment primarily on the clinical treatment response.","['Kekale, Meri', 'Talvensaari, Kimmo', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Airaksinen, Marja']","['Kekale M', 'Talvensaari K', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Porkka K', 'Airaksinen M']","['Clinical Pharmacy Group, Division of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medical Center Mehilainen, Nummela, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Group, Division of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141124,New Zealand,Patient Prefer Adherence,Patient preference and adherence,101475748,PMC4246993,['NOTNLM'],"['Morisky 8-item Medication Adherence Scale', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'knowledge of the disease', 'medication adherence', ""physician's assessment"", 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2014/12/05 06:00,2014/12/05 06:01,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PPA.S70712 [doi]', 'ppa-8-1619 [pii]']",epublish,Patient Prefer Adherence. 2014 Nov 24;8:1619-27. doi: 10.2147/PPA.S70712. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise involvement of any parasite molecule in this process remains uncertain. In the current study, in silico wide analysis demonstrated that genes in the Leishmania donovani genome are highly enriched for CpG motifs, with sequence frequency of 8.7%. Here, we show that unmethylated species-specific CpG motifs in LdDNA significantly (P = 0.01) delay macrophage PCD by endosomal interaction with TLR9 via the adaptor protein MyD88. Importantly, LdDNA triggered high levels of luciferase activity (P = 0.001) under NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in HEK-TLR9 cells. Furthermore, the activation of caspases in macrophages was inhibited (P = 0.001) in the presence of LdDNA. Notably, the delay of PCD was mediated by modulation of the antiapoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 and Bfl-1, and impairment of loss of Deltapsim in macrophages through the neutralization of oxidative and nitrosative stress. The inhibition of caspase activation and up-regulation of Mcl-1 by LdDNA were TLR9 dependent. Analysis of the targets of LdDNA identified an early activation of the TLR9-dependent PI3K/Akt and SFK pathways, which were required for the observation of the antiapoptotic effects in macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrate that LdDNA modulates the TLR9-IkappaB-alpha pathway by promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR9 and the TLR9-mediated recruitment of Syk kinase. The results have identified a novel, TLR9-dependent antiapoptotic function of LdDNA, which will provide new opportunities for discovering and evaluating molecular targets for drug and vaccine designing against VL.","['Das, Sushmita', 'Ghosh, Ayan Kumar', 'Singh, Shikha', 'Saha, Bhaskar', 'Ganguly, Ashish', 'Das, Pradeep']","['Das S', 'Ghosh AK', 'Singh S', 'Saha B', 'Ganguly A', 'Das P']","['*Department of Microbiology, All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India; and National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India sushmita.de2008@gmail.com.', '*Department of Microbiology, All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India; and National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India.', '*Department of Microbiology, All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India; and National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India.', '*Department of Microbiology, All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India; and National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India.', '*Department of Microbiology, All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India; and National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India.', '*Department of Microbiology, All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India; Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India; and National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141203,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,['NOTNLM'],"['PCD', 'PI3K/Akt pathway', 'Syk', 'apoptosis', 'visceral leishmaniasis']",2014/12/05 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.4A0713-378RR [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.4A0713-378RR [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2015 Feb;97(2):363-78. doi: 10.1189/jlb.4A0713-378RR.

Here, we have used an Hhex inducible knockout mouse model to study the role of Hhex in adult hematopoiesis. We found that loss of Hhex was tolerated in HSCs and myeloid lineages, but resulted in a progressive loss of B lymphocytes in the circulation. This was accompanied by a complete loss of B-cell progenitors in the bone marrow and of transitional B-cell subsets in the spleen. In addition, transplantation and in vitro culture experiments demonstrated an almost complete failure of Hhex-null HSCs to contribute to lymphoid lineages beyond the common lymphoid precursor stage, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells. Gene expression analysis of Hhex-deleted progenitors demonstrated deregulated expression of a number of cell cycle regulators. Overexpression of one of these, cyclin D1, could rescue the B-cell developmental potential of Hhex-null lymphoid precursors. Thus, Hhex is a key regulator of early lymphoid development, functioning, at least in part, via regulation of the cell cycle.","['Jackson, Jacob T', 'Nasa, Chayanica', 'Shi, Wei', 'Huntington, Nicholas D', 'Bogue, Clifford W', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'McCormack, Matthew P']","['Jackson JT', 'Nasa C', 'Shi W', 'Huntington ND', 'Bogue CW', 'Alexander WS', 'McCormack MP']","['Division of Cancer and Haematology, and.', 'Division of Cancer and Haematology, and.', 'Bioinformatics, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia; Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia;', 'Department of Medical Biology and Molecular Immunology, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Division of Cancer and Haematology, and Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Division of Cancer and Haematology, and Department of Medical Biology and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141203,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2014/12/05 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35296-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-579813 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 29;125(5):803-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-579813.

Clinical trials for patients with MF focus on new JAK inhibitors with potentially less myelosuppression( pacritinib) or even activity for anemia (momelotinib). Further efforts focus on combination trials (including a JAK inhibitor base) or targeting new pathways (ie, telomerase). Similarly, therapy for PV continues to evolve with phase 3 trials investigating optimal frontline therapy (hydroxyurea or IFN) and second-line therapy for hydroxyurea-refractory or intolerant PV with JAK inhibitors.

Male chlamydial infections are associated with urethritis, epididymitis, and orchitis; however, the role of Chlamydia in prostatitis and male factor infertility remains controversial. Using a model of Chlamydia muridarum infection in male C57BL/6 mice, we investigated the effects of chlamydial infection on spermatogenesis and determined the potential of immune T cells to prevent infection-induced outcomes. Antigen-specific CD4 T cells significantly reduced the infectious burden in the penile urethra, epididymis, and vas deferens. Infection disrupted seminiferous tubules, causing loss of germ cells at 4 and 8 wk after infection, with the most severely affected tubules containing only Sertoli cells. Increased mitotic proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis in spermatogonial cells and damaged germ cells were evident in atrophic tubules. Activated caspase 3 (casp3) staining revealed increased (6-fold) numbers of Sertoli cells with abnormal morphology that were casp3 positive in tubules of infected mice, indicating increased levels of apoptosis. Sperm count and motility were both decreased in infected mice, and there was a significant decrease in morphologically normal spermatozoa. Assessment of the spermatogonial stem cell population revealed a decrease in promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)-positive cells in the seminiferous tubules. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD4 cells, particularly T-helper 2-like cells, prior to infection prevented these effects in spermatogenesis and Sertoli cells. These data suggest that chlamydial infection adversely affects spermatogenesis and male fertility, and that vaccination can potentially prevent the spread of infection and these adverse outcomes.","['Sobinoff, Alexander P', 'Dando, Samantha J', 'Redgrove, Kate A', 'Sutherland, Jessie M', 'Stanger, Simone J', 'Armitage, Charles W', 'Timms, Peter', 'McLaughlin, Eileen A', 'Beagley, Kenneth W']","['Sobinoff AP', 'Dando SJ', 'Redgrove KA', 'Sutherland JM', 'Stanger SJ', 'Armitage CW', 'Timms P', 'McLaughlin EA', 'Beagley KW']","['Priority Research Centres in Chemical Biology and Reproductive Science, School of Environmental & Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centres in Chemical Biology and Reproductive Science, School of Environmental & Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centres in Chemical Biology and Reproductive Science, School of Environmental & Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centres in Chemical Biology and Reproductive Science, School of Environmental & Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centres in Chemical Biology and Reproductive Science, School of Environmental & Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia k2.beagley@qut.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141203,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chlamydia muridarum', 'Sertoli cell', 'T cells', 'spermatogenesis']",2014/12/05 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.114.124180 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.114.124180 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2015 Jan;92(1):27. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.114.124180.

METHODS: MPV, glycocalicin and platelet-associated IgG (PA-IgG) were measured in 107 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and 19 patients with hypoproductive thrombocytopenia (HPT; aplastic anemia or leukemia), and TPO was measured in 53 ITP and 12 HPT patients. All the included ITP patients had PA-IgG >/=300% and glycocalicin >/=50% of control values, and HPT patients had PA-IgG <300% and glycocalicin <50% of control values. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: MPV was higher in ITP than in HPT patients: 9.56 +/- 1.69 and 7.59 +/- 0.90 fl (p < 0.001). In the ITP group a direct correlation was detected between MPV and glycocalicin (r = 0.344, p < 0.001).

Unfortunately, there is limited data regarding the therapeutic equivalency of generic tacrolimus formulations especially in children. We report the case of a pediatric patient having an inability to achieve a therapeutic trough level for tacrolimus after conversion from brand name to the generic formulation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-month-old male patient diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient initially received intravenous (i.v.) tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and achieved therapeutic levels. The patient was then switched to an oral brand formulation of tacrolimus, and was able to maintain trough levels within the therapeutic range. After being discharged, the patient received the generic formulation of tacrolimus from an outside pharmacy and the care team was unable to reach therapeutic levels despite multiple dose escalations. Returning to brand name tacrolimus resulted in prompt achievement of therapeutic levels. CONCLUSIONS: A likely etiology for the inability to achieve therapeutic trough levels in this patient is the change in formulation from brand formulation to generic version. Other factors including drug-drug interaction, preparation of the medication by a different pharmacy, drug-food interaction and genetic factors were also considered. Physicians and pharmacists must be aware of the inability to achieve targeted therapeutic concentrations of tacrolimus resulting from the conversion of brand name to the generic formulation until these generic formulations are tested in clinical trials in a pediatric population.","['Madian, Ashraf G', 'Panigrahi, Arun', 'Perera, Minoli A', 'Pinto, Navin']","['Madian AG', 'Panigrahi A', 'Perera MA', 'Pinto N']","['Committee of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. npinto1@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141203,England,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,BMC pharmacology & toxicology,101590449,PMC4287354,,,2014/12/05 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['2050-6511-15-69 [pii]', '10.1186/2050-6511-15-69 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol. 2014 Dec 3;15:69. doi: 10.1186/2050-6511-15-69.,,IM,"['Drug Substitution', 'Drugs, Generic/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Tacrolimus/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Transplantation, Homologous']","['0 (Drugs, Generic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,"['T32 GM007019/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000430/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM007019/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis-unrelated functions of Mcl-1 are however emerging, further justifying its tight regulation. Here we unravel a novel mechanism of Mcl-1 regulation mediated by the haplo-insufficient tumour suppressor Beclin 1. Beclin 1 negatively modulates Mcl-1 stability in a reciprocal manner whereby depletion of one leads to the stabilization of the other. This co-regulation is independent of autophagy and of their physical interaction. Both Beclin 1 and Mcl-1 are deubiquitinated and thus stabilized by binding to a common deubiquitinase, USP9X. Beclin 1 and Mcl-1 negatively modulate the proteasomal degradation of each other through competitive displacement of USP9X. The analysis of patient-derived melanoma cells and tissue samples shows that the levels of Beclin 1 decrease, while Mcl-1 levels subsequently increase during melanoma progression in a significant inter-dependent manner. The identified inverse co-regulation of Beclin 1 and Mcl-1 represents a mechanism of functional counteraction in cancer.","['Elgendy, Mohamed', 'Ciro, Marco', 'Abdel-Aziz, Amal Kamal', 'Belmonte, Giuseppe', 'Dal Zuffo, Roberto', 'Mercurio, Ciro', 'Miracco, Clelia', 'Lanfrancone, Luisa', 'Foiani, Marco', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Elgendy M', 'Ciro M', 'Abdel-Aziz AK', 'Belmonte G', 'Dal Zuffo R', 'Mercurio C', 'Miracco C', 'Lanfrancone L', 'Foiani M', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy [2] IFOM (Fondazione Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare) at the IFOM-European Institute of Oncology (IEO) Campus, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy.', '1] IFOM (Fondazione Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare) at the IFOM-European Institute of Oncology (IEO) Campus, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milan, Italy [2] Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, 20100 Milan, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy [2] Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, 20100 Milan, Italy [3] Drug Development Program, European Institute of Oncology, IEO, 20139 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141204,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,,,,2014/12/05 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms6637 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms6637 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Dec 4;5:5637. doi: 10.1038/ncomms6637.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Autophagy', 'Beclin-1', '*Carcinogenesis', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*metabolism/secondary', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/metabolism']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 2003 to 2010, 231 ACL patients were enrolled in this study. Patients with 11q deletion and atypical lymphocyte morphology at diagnosis had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.007 and p = 0.015, respectively) and treatment-free survival (TFS) (p = 0.009 and p = 0.017, respectively).

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intensive chemotherapy in elderly AML patients and to determine which subgroup of patients would be most responsive to the therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 84 elderly patients: 35, 19, and 30 patients were administered intensive chemotherapy, low-dose chemotherapy, and supportive care, respectively. RESULTS: Among those who received intensive chemotherapy, there were 17 cases of remission after induction chemotherapy; treatment-related mortality was 22.9%. The median overall survival was 7.9 months. Multivariate analysis indicated that the significant prognostic factors for overall survival were performance status, fever before treatment, platelet count, blast count, cytogenetic risk category, and intensive chemotherapy. Subgroup analysis showed that intensive chemotherapy was markedly effective in the relatively younger patients (65-70 years) and those with de novo AML, better-to-intermediate cytogenetic risk, no fever before treatment, high albumin levels, and high lactate dehydrogenase levels. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly AML patients had better outcomes with intensive chemotherapy than with low-intensity chemotherapy. Thus, appropriate subgroup selection for intensive chemotherapy is likely to improve therapeutic outcome.","['Kim, Dae Sik', 'Kang, Ka Won', 'Yu, Eun Sang', 'Kim, Hong Jun', 'Kim, Jung Sun', 'Lee, Se Ryeon', 'Park, Yong', 'Sung, Hwa Jung', 'Yoon, Soo Young', 'Choi, Chul Won', 'Kim, Byung Soo']","['Kim DS', 'Kang KW', 'Yu ES', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim JS', 'Lee SR', 'Park Y', 'Sung HJ', 'Yoon SY', 'Choi CW', 'Kim BS']","['Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141202,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,,,2014/12/05 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['000362777 [pii]', '10.1159/000362777 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2015;133(3):300-9. doi: 10.1159/000362777.

METHODS: Using flow cytometry analysis, we investigated the expression of CDs160/200 on B cells from 124 patients (82 CLL, 42 other B-cell neoplasms) and nine controls. CDs160/200 measurements were determined as a ratio of the mean fluorescence intensities of leukemic cells/controls and were considered positive when the ratios were >/=2 and 20, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty and 83% CLL expressed CDs160/200 as compared to 5% and 10% of other B-cell neoplasms, respectively. None of the controls showed CDs160/200 expressions. Combination of both markers was observed in 55% of CLL but only in 2% of other B-cell neoplasms, and absence of both markers occurred in 12% of CLL but in 86% of other B-cell neoplasms. CONCLUSION: CDs160/200 were associated with markers of the gold standard 'Matutes score' and could be useful markers to differentiate atypical CLL from other B-cell neoplasms in the absence of available biopsies or cytogenetics and molecular studies.","['Lesesve, J-F', 'Tardy, S', 'Frotscher, B', 'Latger-Cannard, V', 'Feugier, P', 'De Carvalho Bittencourt, M']","['Lesesve JF', 'Tardy S', 'Frotscher B', 'Latger-Cannard V', 'Feugier P', 'De Carvalho Bittencourt M']","['Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141203,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell neoplasms', 'CD160', 'CD200', 'CLL', 'immunophenotyping']",2014/12/04 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12315 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Aug;37(4):486-94. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12315.

Hence, they exist in protonated (cation) form at physiological pH, a characteristic is of key importance for their pharmacological activity. Recently, we have found that a number of S-pentabromobenzylisothiourea derivatives show substantial cytotoxicity toward a variety of human glioblastoma, leukemia, and adenocarcinoma cell lines. Whereas there is a growing body of data on aliphatic and alkylaromatic isothioureas, little attention was given to this day to heterocyclic isotiourea derivatives. Here we report on the synthesis and pharmacological in vitro properties of 10 novel S-(benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl)- and S-(5,6-dichlorobenzimidazol-2-ylmethyl)isothiourea derivatives. The compounds were obtained by the condensation of the respective 2-chloromethyl benzimidazoles with various substituted N(N')-thioureas. Besides the essential physicochemical characteristics (H-NMR, UV, elemental analysis) of the new compounds, their log P values, which are of key importance for in vivo drug distribution and interactions, were determined. Pharmacological (anticancer) activity of the compounds was evaluated based on their ability to induce apoptosis in exponentially growing cultures of the human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line KG-1; the apoptosis was assessed with a variety of flow cytometric methods. Of the novel compounds tested, the most potent apoptosis inducer in KG-1 cells was N-methyl-S- (5,6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl)isothiouronium chloride (ClBMMe).","['Koronkiewicz, Miroslawa', 'Romiszewska, Anna', 'Chilmonczyk, Zdzislaw', 'Kazimierczuk, Zygmunt']","['Koronkiewicz M', 'Romiszewska A', 'Chilmonczyk Z', 'Kazimierczuk Z']","['Department of Cell Biology, National Medicines Institute, Chelmska St. 30/34, 00-725 Warsaw, Poland. m.koronkiewicz@nil.gov.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,,,,2014/12/04 06:00,2016/02/02 06:00,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['MC-EPUB-63787 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406410666141203124329 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2015;11(4):364-72. doi: 10.2174/1573406410666141203124329.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiourea/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study's objective was to assess FNHTR occurrence and potential risk factors among inpatient U.S. elderly Medicare beneficiaries, ages 65 and older, during 2011-2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective claims-based study utilized large Medicare administrative databases. FNHTR was ascertained via ICD-9-CM diagnosis code, and transfusions were identified by recorded procedure and revenue centre codes. The study ascertained FNHTR rates among the inpatient elderly overall and by age, gender, race, blood components and units transfused. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess potential risk factors. RESULTS: Among 4 336 338 inpatient transfusion stays for elderly during 2011-2012, 2517 had FNHTR diagnosis recorded, an overall rate of 58.0 per 100,000 stays. FNHTR rates (per 100,000 stays) varied by age, gender, number of units and blood components transfused. FNHTR rates were substantially higher for RBCs- and platelets-containing transfusions as compared to plasma only. Significantly higher odds of FNHTR were identified with greater number of units transfused (P < 0.01), for females vs. males (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27), and with 1-year histories of transfusion (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.42), lymphoma (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.46), leukaemia (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.56-2.31) and other diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows increased FNHTR occurrence among elderly with greater number of units and with RBCs- and platelets-containing transfusions, suggesting need to evaluate effectiveness of prestorage leucoreduction in elderly. The study also suggests importance of prior recipient alloimmunization and underlying health conditions in the development of FNHTR.","['Menis, M', 'Forshee, R A', 'Anderson, S A', 'McKean, S', 'Gondalia, R', 'Warnock, R', 'Johnson, C', 'Mintz, P D', 'Worrall, C M', 'Kelman, J A', 'Izurieta, H S']","['Menis M', 'Forshee RA', 'Anderson SA', 'McKean S', 'Gondalia R', 'Warnock R', 'Johnson C', 'Mintz PD', 'Worrall CM', 'Kelman JA', 'Izurieta HS']","['Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20141203,England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,,['NOTNLM'],"['Medicare', 'administrative databases', 'elderly', 'febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reaction', 'inpatient', 'potential risk factors']",2014/12/04 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vox.12215 [doi]'],ppublish,Vox Sang. 2015 Apr;108(3):251-61. doi: 10.1111/vox.12215.

To date, studies addressing bioactivities of myrtle and its specific components are rare. Here, we investigated the biological effects of MCA, focusing on its anti-leukemic activity. As evidenced by fragmented nuclei after Hoechst/propidium iodide staining and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, MCA induces apoptosis in CML cells through down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins.

Thus, the present study carried out a meta-analysis to provide a more precise estimate of the effect of this polymorphism on the susceptibility to leukemia. The published case-control studies regarding the association between MDR1 C1236T polymorphism and leukemia risk were included following a computerized search of PubMed, Elsevier, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Database. Either fixed- or random-effects models were applied to calculate the combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by RevMan 5.2 software. Seven studies, including 846 cases and 1,523 controls, were included in the present meta-analysis. The results indicated that there was no significant association between the MDR1 C1236T polymorphism and leukemia risk in overall comparisons in all four genetic models (CT vs. CC: OR, 1.31, 95% CI, 0.89-1.91, P=0.17; TT vs. CC: OR, 2.16, 95% CI, 0.99-4.70, P=0.05; TT vs. CC+CT: OR, 1.72, 95% CI, 0.91-3.25, P=0.09; and CT+TT vs. CC: OR, 1.57, 95% CI, 0.96-2.56, P=0.07). In the subgroup analysis according to specific ethnicity, age and the type of leukemia, a significant association was found in adult leukemia (CT+TT vs. CC: OR, 2.77, 95% CI, 1.05-7.31, P=0.04) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CT vs. CC: OR, 1.71, 95% CI, 1.05-2.80, P=0.03). No significant publication bias was detected by funnel plot. Therefore, the meta-analysis indicated that the MDR1 C1236T polymorphism may contribute to the susceptibility to adult leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia.

Cytarabine, while effective in killing leukemic cells, is subject to development of several resistance mechanisms rendering the drug ineffective in many patients. Elacytarabine, a lipophilic 5'-elaidic acid ester or nucleoside analogue of cytosine arabinoside, was created with the intent of overcoming resistance mechanisms including reduced expression of the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) required for cytarabine entry into cells, as well as increased activity of cytidine deaminase (CDA) which breaks down the active metabolite of cytarabine, ara-CTP. Elacytarabine enters cells independently of transporters, has a longer half life compared with cytarabine and is not subject to deactivation by CDA. Preclinical data were encouraging although subsequent clinical studies have failed to show superiority of elacytarabine compared with standard of care as monotherapy in patients with AML. Clinical trials utilizing elacytarabine in combination with anthracyclines are ongoing. Use of hENT1 expression as a predictive marker for cytarabine or elacytarabine response has been studied with no conclusive validation to date. Despite promising early results, the jury is still out in regards to this novel agent as an effective alternative to standard cytarabine therapy in acute leukemias, especially in combination with additional agents such as anthracyclines.","['Rein, Lindsay A M', 'Rizzieri, David A']","['Rein LA', 'Rizzieri DA']","['Duke University Medical Center - Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University Medical Center - Medicine, 1149 North Pavilion Duke University Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC4250268,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'elacytarabine', 'therapy']",2014/12/04 06:00,2014/12/04 06:01,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620714552615 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620714552615 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2014 Dec;5(6):211-20. doi: 10.1177/2040620714552615.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNMT3A mutations occur early in the leukaemogenic process and may even act as ""founder"" mutations - the first step in a pathway towards malignant transformation. As such, these mutations may represent a Dionysian agent of disorder, inciting the chaotic myeloid proliferation and arrest of differentiation which are hallmarks of AML.

However, ADMSCs exhibit resistant to most gene transfection techniques and the use of highly efficient viral vectors has several disadvantages primarily concerning safety risk. Here, we optimized the use of highly efficient and safe nucleofection-based transfection using plasmid encoded for TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) into ADMSCs and investigated the potential anti-tumourigenic of TRAIL-expressing ADMSCs (ADMSCs-TRAIL) on selected cancer models in vitro. METHODS: Different concentration of TRAIL-encoded plasmid and ADMSCs were nucleofected and the percentage of fluorescence cells were analyzed to determine the optimal condition. TRAIL protein and mRNA were validated in nucloeofected ADMSCs using ELISA and RT-PCR respectively. Evaluation of TRAIL specific death receptors were performed on both tumours (A549/lung tumour, LN18/glioblastoma and HepG2/hepatocellular carcinoma) and haematological malignant lines (REH/acute lymphocytic leukaemia, K562/chronic myelogenous leukaemia and KMS-28BM/multiple myeloma) using flow cytometry. ADMSCs-TRAIL was subsequently assessed for anti-tumourigenic properties using both proliferation assay (MTS assay) and apoptosis assay (Annexin-V / Propidium Iodide staining). RESULTS: Nucleofection showed increased total plasmid concentration (2 mug to 8 mug) resulted in significantly higher reporter expression (11.33% to 39.7%) with slight reduction on cells viability (~10%). ADMSCs-TRAIL significantly inhibited ~50% of cell proliferation in LN18, signifying sensitivity of the cell to ADMSCs-TRAIL mediated inhibition. Inhibition of both tumour and malignant lines proliferation by ADMSCs-TRAIL conditioned medium noticed in HepG2, A549 and REH respectively, whereas K562 and KMS-28BM malignant lines exhibit resistant to ADMSCs-TRAIL mediated inhibition. Moreover, we found that native ADMSCs alone were capable of inducing apoptosis in both LN18 and HepG2 tumour lines, despite substantial increased on the percentage of apoptosis by ADMSCs-TRAIL. CONCLUSION: ADMSCs-TRAIL selectively inhibit cancer model and markedly induces apoptosis. Through investigation of the specific TRAIL death receptors expression, we saw that the receptors expression did influence the sensitivity of some but not all cancer lines to TRAIL-mediated inhibition. This study provides further insight into the anti-tumourigenic potential of ADMSCs-TRAIL on different cancer models.","['Fakiruddin, Kamal Shaik', 'Baharuddin, Puteri', 'Lim, Moon Nian', 'Fakharuzi, Noor Atiqah', 'Yusof, Nurul Ain Nasim M', 'Zakaria, Zubaidah']","['Fakiruddin KS', 'Baharuddin P', 'Lim MN', 'Fakharuzi NA', 'Yusof NA', 'Zakaria Z']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research (IMR), 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research (IMR), 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research (IMR), 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research (IMR), 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research (IMR), 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research (IMR), 50588 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141126,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC4247692,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer cell lines', 'Human adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells', 'Nucleofection', 'Proliferation', 'TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)']",2014/12/04 06:00,2014/12/04 06:01,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-014-0122-8 [doi]', '122 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2014 Nov 26;14(1):122. doi: 10.1186/s12935-014-0122-8. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ott1 (Rbm15), a spliceosomal component originally identified as a fusion partner in t(1;22)-associated acute megakaryocytic leukemia, is also essential for maintaining HSC quiescence under stress. Ott1 controls the alternative splicing of a dominant negative isoform, Mpl-TR, capable of inhibiting HSC engraftment and attenuating Thpo signaling. Ott1, which associates with Hdac3 and the histone methyltransferase, Setd1b, binds to both c-Mpl RNA and chromatin and regulates H4 acetylation and H3K4me3 marks. Histone deacetylase or histone methyltransferase inhibition also increases Mpl-TR levels, suggesting that Ott1 uses an underlying epigenetic mechanism to control alternative splicing of c-Mpl. Manipulation of Ott1-dependent alternative splicing may therefore provide a novel pharmacologic avenue for regulating HSC quiescence and proliferation in response to Thpo.","['Xiao, Nan', 'Laha, Suparna', 'Das, Shankar P', 'Morlock, Kayla', 'Jesneck, Jonathan L', 'Raffel, Glen D']","['Xiao N', 'Laha S', 'Das SP', 'Morlock K', 'Jesneck JL', 'Raffel GD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Essess, Inc., Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141202,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4319236,,,2014/12/04 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39477-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-08-593392 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 5;125(6):941-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-08-593392.

Our results from this first GWAS of AYA ALL susceptibility point to unique biology underlying leukemogenesis and potentially distinct disease etiology by age group.","['Perez-Andreu, Virginia', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Xu, Heng', 'Smith, Colton', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Cheng, I-Ming', 'Carroll, William L', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Dean, Michael', 'Burchard, Esteban G', 'Torgerson, Dara G', 'Yue, Feng', 'Wang, Yanli', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E', 'Gerhard, Daniela S', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Perez-Andreu V', 'Roberts KG', 'Xu H', 'Smith C', 'Zhang H', 'Yang W', 'Harvey RC', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Devidas M', 'Cheng IM', 'Carroll WL', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Raetz EA', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Mrozek K', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Stock W', 'Kornblau SM', 'Konopleva M', 'Paietta E', 'Rowe JM', 'Luger SM', 'Tallman MS', 'Dean M', 'Burchard EG', 'Torgerson DG', 'Yue F', 'Wang Y', 'Pui CH', 'Jeha S', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE', 'Gerhard DS', 'Loh ML', 'Willman CL', 'Hunger SP', 'Mullighan CG', 'Yang JJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China;', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM;', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine, Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL;', 'Cancer Research and Treatment Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM;', 'Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY;', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', ""The Ohio State University, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH;"", 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;

Widespread implementation of this testing is hampered by technical challenges associated with the GC content of the gene, the variability of the mutations, and the complexity of the sequence analysis and variant interpretation. We developed a robust Sanger-sequencing test to detect CEBPA mutations in diagnostic acute myeloid leukemia specimens. Our experience with testing 2393 cases of suspected myeloid neoplasms is presented. NPM1, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), and FLT3-D835 mutation status were determined in parallel; 160 (6.7%) cases harbored CEBPA mutations, including 86 with a single mutation and 74 with double mutations. Nineteen single-mutant cases and 3 double-mutant cases showed only nucleotide substitutions that could not be detected by fragment-analysis-based tests. A subset of cases harbored double mutations with uneven mutant allele frequency and required careful interpretation because of possible leukemic heterogeneity. NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations were more frequent in single- compared with double-mutation cases (31% versus 5% for NPM1, and 28% versus 16% for FLT3-ITD). This sequencing-based assay provides an efficient and reliable CEBPA mutation testing platform, permitting detection of all mutations with immediate distinction of single- and double-mutation cases. Given the technical challenges, robust Sanger-sequencing assays continue to maintain an important role in clinical CEBPA testing despite the development of multigene next-generation sequencing assays.","['Behdad, Amir', 'Weigelin, Helmut C', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo S J', 'Betz, Bryan L']","['Behdad A', 'Weigelin HC', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KS', 'Betz BL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Secondary graft failure, i.e. loss of donor cells after initial engraftment, is a relatively uncommon but serious and life-theatening complication after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of secondary graft failure after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome during antiepileptic treatment with levetiracetam. Exclusion of all other possible etiologies left levetiracetam as the most likely cause of the imminent complete secondary graft failure after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, the blood cell count improved just a few days after cessation of levetiracetam medication. CONCLUSION: Thus, we recommend that in case of secondary graft failure after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, all possible causes should carefully be excluded, including adverse events through new generation AED agents. Switching to different AEDs with less harming effect on bone marrow function should strongly be considered.","['Peyrl, Andreas', 'Weichert, Nina', 'Kuhl, Jorn-Sven', 'Ebell, Wolfram', 'Hernaiz Driever, Pablo']","['Peyrl A', 'Weichert N', 'Kuhl JS', 'Ebell W', 'Hernaiz Driever P']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

The essence of acquired immunity is molecular self/non self discrimination. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by a global failure of immune system that begins with the failure of immunological tolerance mechanisms (autoimmunity) and finish with the incapacity to response to non-self antigens (immunodeficiency). Immunological tolerance mechanisms are involved in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) development. During B cell development some self-reactive B cells acquire a special BCR that recognize their own BCR. This self-autoantibody-self BCR interaction promotes survival, differentiation and proliferation of self-reactive B cells. Continuous self-autoantibody-self BCR interaction cross-linking induces an increased rate of surface BCR elimination, CD5+ expression, receptor editing and anergy. Unfortunately, some times this mechanisms increase genomic instability and promote additional genetic damage that immortalize self-reactive B cells and convert them into CLL like clones with the capability of clonal evolution and transformed CLL B cells. This review summarizes the immunological effects of continuous self-autoantibody-self BCR interaction cross-linking in the surface of self-reactive B cells and their role in CLL development.","['Garcia-Munoz, Ricardo', 'Feliu, Jesus', 'Llorente, Luis']","['Garcia-Munoz R', 'Feliu J', 'Llorente L']","['Hematology Department, Hospital San Pedro, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain.

The last decade has seen significant advances in the development of biomarkers in oncology that play a critical role in understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms which drive tumor initiation, maintenance and progression. Clinical molecular diagnostics and biomarker discoveries in oncology are advancing rapidly as we begin to understand the complex mechanisms that transform a normal cell into an abnormal one. These discoveries have fueled the development of novel drug targets and new treatment strategies. The standard of care for patients with advanced-stage cancers has shifted away from an empirical treatment strategy based on the clinical-pathological profile to one where a biomarker driven treatment algorithm based on the molecular profile of the tumor is used. Recent advances in multiplex genotyping technologies and high-throughput genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing make possible the rapid and comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome of individual patients even from very little tumor biopsy material. Predictive (diagnostic) biomarkers are helpful in matching targeted therapies with patients and in preventing toxicity of standard (systemic) therapies. Prognostic biomarkers identify somatic germ line mutations, changes in DNA methylation, elevated levels of microRNA (miRNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood. Predictive biomarkers using molecular diagnostics are currently in use in clinical practice of personalized oncotherapy for the treatment of five diseases: chronic myeloid leukemia, colon, breast, lung cancer and melanoma and these biomarkers are being used successfully to evaluate benefits that can be achieved through targeted therapy. Examples of these molecularly targeted biomarker therapies are: tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors; anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors in lung cancer with EML4-ALk fusion; HER2/neu blockage in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer; and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) inhibition in EGFR-mutated lung cancer. This review presents the current state of our knowledge of biomarkers in five selected cancers: chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.","['Kalia, Madhu']",['Kalia M'],"['Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia PA 19107.

From the present results, it is concluded that imbalance in the expression of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes may be an important cause for the compromised development potential of the oocytes in cultured ovarian follicles of sheep.","['Praveen Chakravarthi, V', 'Kona, S S R', 'Siva Kumar, A V N', 'Bhaskar, M', 'Rao, V H']","['Praveen Chakravarthi V', 'Kona SS', 'Siva Kumar AV', 'Bhaskar M', 'Rao VH']","['Department of Zoology, Division of Biotechnology, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Physiology, Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, College of Veterinary Science, S.V.Veterinary University, Tirupati-517502, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Physiology, Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, College of Veterinary Science, S.V.Veterinary University, Tirupati-517502, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Division of Biotechnology, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Physiology, Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, College of Veterinary Science, S.V.Veterinary University, Tirupati-517502, Andhra Pradesh, India.

We aimed to initiate worldwide surveillance of cancer survival by central analysis of population-based registry data, as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems, and to inform global policy on cancer control. METHODS: Individual tumour records were submitted by 279 population-based cancer registries in 67 countries for 25.7 million adults (age 15-99 years) and 75,000 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1995-2009 and followed up to Dec 31, 2009, or later. We looked at cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, and prostate in adults, and adult and childhood leukaemia. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were corrected by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival, adjusted for background mortality in every country or region by age (single year), sex, and calendar year, and by race or ethnic origin in some countries. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. FINDINGS: 5-year survival from colon, rectal, and breast cancers has increased steadily in most developed countries. For patients diagnosed during 2005-09, survival for colon and rectal cancer reached 60% or more in 22 countries around the world; for breast cancer, 5-year survival rose to 85% or higher in 17 countries worldwide. Liver and lung cancer remain lethal in all nations: for both cancers, 5-year survival is below 20% everywhere in Europe, in the range 15-19% in North America, and as low as 7-9% in Mongolia and Thailand. Striking rises in 5-year survival from prostate cancer have occurred in many countries: survival rose by 10-20% between 1995-99 and 2005-09 in 22 countries in South America, Asia, and Europe, but survival still varies widely around the world, from less than 60% in Bulgaria and Thailand to 95% or more in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the USA. For cervical cancer, national estimates of 5-year survival range from less than 50% to more than 70%; regional variations are much wider, and improvements between 1995-99 and 2005-09 have generally been slight. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005-09, 5-year survival was 40% or higher only in Ecuador, the USA, and 17 countries in Asia and Europe. 5-year survival for stomach cancer in 2005-09 was high (54-58%) in Japan and South Korea, compared with less than 40% in other countries. By contrast, 5-year survival from adult leukaemia in Japan and South Korea (18-23%) is lower than in most other countries. 5-year survival from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less than 60% in several countries, but as high as 90% in Canada and four European countries, which suggests major deficiencies in the management of a largely curable disease. INTERPRETATION: International comparison of survival trends reveals very wide differences that are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimum treatment. Continuous worldwide surveillance of cancer survival should become an indispensable source of information for cancer patients and researchers and a stimulus for politicians to improve health policy and health-care systems.

METHODS: This study used US health plan claims data from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2011. Patients were required to be aged >/=18 years, have a prescription fill for a TKI, and a diagnosis of CML. Duration of TKI use was determined based on a gap in TKI coverage of >/=180 consecutive days after TKI initiation or switch to another TKI within the 180-day window. To account for censoring due to disenrollment from the health plan or end of the study period, median treatment duration was projected by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. FINDINGS: We identified 695 patients who started TKI treatment and had a CML diagnosis during the study time frame. The mean age of patients was 55 years, and 58% of patients were male. The most common first-line TKI was imatinib (82%), with dasatinib and nilotinib use equally distributed (9%). Among the 148 (21.3%) patients who initiated a second-line TKI, the majority had switched from imatinib to dasatinib or nilotinib (86%). The median duration of first-line TKI use was 39.8 months and second-line TKI use was 22.4 months. Median duration of treatment for first-line (P = 0.4342) and second-line (P = 0.1792) treatment did not differ significantly according to TKI. Mean adherence (ie, proportion of days covered) during the first line of therapy was 0.90. IMPLICATIONS: For the US patients studied, we found that imatinib was used more frequently than other TKIs in the first-line setting, but there was an increased use of second-generation TKIs in the first-line setting over time (9% in 2008 vs 43% in 2011 were nilotinib or dasatinib users). Only about one fifth of patients switched to a second-line TKI during the period of data collection.","['Henk, Henry J', 'Woloj, Mabel', 'Shapiro, Mark', 'Whiteley, Jennifer']","['Henk HJ', 'Woloj M', 'Shapiro M', 'Whiteley J']","['Optum, Eden Prairie, Minnesota.

CLL is often treated with drugs that ablate all B cells, leading to further weakening of humoral immunity, and a more focused therapeutic strategy capable of targeting only the pathogenic B cells would represent a significant advance. One approach to this would be to develop synthetic surrogates of the CLL antigens allowing differentiation of the CLL cells and healthy B cells in a patient. Here, we describe nonpeptidic molecules capable of targeting antigen-specific B cell receptors with good affinity and selectivity using a combinatorial library screen. We demonstrate that our hit compounds act as synthetic antigen surrogates and recognize CLL cells and not healthy B cells. Additionally, we argue that the technology we developed can be used to identify other classes of antigen surrogates.","['Sarkar, Mohosin', 'Liu, Yun', 'Morimoto, Jumpei', 'Peng, Haiyong', 'Aquino, Claudio', 'Rader, Christoph', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Kodadek, Thomas']","['Sarkar M', 'Liu Y', 'Morimoto J', 'Peng H', 'Aquino C', 'Rader C', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Kodadek T']","['Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.', 'The Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA; Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.', 'The Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA; Department of Cancer Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.

We here reported a case of T-LGL leukemia complicated by PRCA in which anemia was resistant to cyclosporine and had been controlled for several years by cyclophosphamide; however, progressive anemia developed despite the administration of cyclophosphamide, but was ameliorated by the re-administration of cyclosporine. The present case demonstrated the 3 different phases of T-LGL proliferation associated with anemia (1st, T-LGL leukemia; 2nd, polyclonal T-LGL expansion; 3rd, myelodysplastic syndrome). We also showed that cyclophosphamide was effective when PRCA was caused by increased numbers of LGL, whereas cyclosporine was administered when hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome was suspected as the main cause of anemia.

However, there is few data about its treatment outcome in Asian patients. Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of hyper-CVAD induction and stem cell transplantation (SCT) consolidation in LBL patients. The treatment responses of 49 patients treated with the hyper-CVAD regimen were retrospectively analyzed in 13 institutions. Given 24 patients who responded to hyper-CVAD underwent consolidation treatment with SCT, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients who received SCT were compared with patients who did not. The overall response rate was 79 %: 73 % (36/49) complete responses, 6 % (3/49) partial responses, and 4 % (2/49) induction deaths. The major limitation for the delivery of the planned hyper-CVAD cycles was hematological toxicity. Among 39 responders, 24 patients underwent autologous (n = 16) and allogeneic SCT (n = 8) consolidation. Their 3-year OS and PFS rates were 76 and 78 %, respectively, and there was no difference in survival outcomes between autologous and allogeneic SCT. However, 15 patients without SCT consolidation showed poorer PFS even though they all achieved complete response. Thus, only seven patients maintained their response at the time of analysis. In conclusion, the hyper-CVAD regimen is effective for remission induction in LBL, and SCT consolidation after hyper-CVAD induction produced better clinical outcomes than did continuation of hyper-CVAD.","['Jeong, Seong Hyun', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Park, Yong', 'Cho, Seok Goo', 'Kwak, Jae-Yong', 'Eom, Hyeon Seok', 'Won, Jong Ho', 'Hong, Jun Shik', 'Oh, Sung Yong', 'Lee, Ho Sup', 'Kim, Seok Jin']","['Jeong SH', 'Moon JH', 'Kim JS', 'Yang DH', 'Park Y', 'Cho SG', 'Kwak JY', 'Eom HS', 'Won JH', 'Hong JS', 'Oh SY', 'Lee HS', 'Kim SJ']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20141203,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,,,2014/12/04 06:00,2015/05/02 06:00,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2258-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94(4):617-25. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2258-y.

With different states of disease, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is particularly suited for the application of multi-state models. In this article, we tried to find a model for CML that allows predicting the prevalence of three different states (initial state of disease, remission and progression) in dependence on treatment, adjusted for age, sex and risk score. Based on the German CML Study IV, one of the largest randomised studies in CML, the model was able to represent the known effects of age and risk score on the probabilities of remission and progression. Patients achieving a major molecular remission had a better chance of surviving without progression, but this effect was not significant. Comparing treatments, patient of the high-dose arm had the greatest chance to be in the state ""remission"" at 5 years but did not seem to have an advantage considering ""progression"". The proposed illness-death model can be useful for predicting the course of CML based on the patient's individual covariates (trial registration: this is an explorative analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00055874).","['Lauseker, Michael', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Hoffmann, Verena S', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Pfirrmann, Markus']","['Lauseker M', 'Hasford J', 'Hoffmann VS', 'Muller MC', 'Hehlmann R', 'Pfirrmann M']","['Institut fur medizinische Informationsverarbeitung, Biometrie und Epidemiologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munchen, Germany, lauseker@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141203,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,,,2014/12/04 06:00,2015/07/25 06:00,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2246-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Jun;94(6):919-27. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2246-2.

METHODS: Patients with unilateral WT (stages I-IV) excluding metachronous relapse or early progressive disease were eligible. Metastatic and 'inoperable' tumours were biopsied electively. 'Local' was defined as relapse within the abdomen, except for liver metastases considered as 'distant' relapse, together with other haematogenous routes. Uni- and multivariable analyses estimated the risk factors for relapse. RESULTS: Overall, 285/635 (44.9%) patients had a biopsy. With a median follow-up of 10.1 years, 35 (5.5%) patients experienced a 'local', 15 a combined (2.4%) and 60 (9.4%) a 'distant' relapse. On univariate analysis, biopsy, anaplasia and tumour size were associated with an increased risk of local relapse. On multivariable analysis, anaplasia and tumour size remained significant for local relapse whereas the elevated risk of biopsy (hazards ratio (HR) = 1.80: 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-3.32, p = 0.060) was marginal. Age, anaplasia, tumour size, lymph nodes metastases and stage, but not biopsy, were individually associated with increased risk of distant relapse but only age and anaplasia remained significant following multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The UKW3 trial provides some reassurance that biopsy should not automatically lead to 'upstaging' of WT. Further assessment of this controversial area is required. Comparison of local relapse rates in a multinational trial in which the United Kingdom (UK) continued the practice of routinely biopsying all patients in contrast to the standard European approach will afford this opportunity and is planned.","['Irtan, S', 'Jitlal, M', 'Bate, J', 'Powis, M', 'Vujanic, G', 'Kelsey, A', 'Walker, J', 'Mitchell, C', 'Machin, D', 'Pritchard-Jones, K']","['Irtan S', 'Jitlal M', 'Bate J', 'Powis M', 'Vujanic G', 'Kelsey A', 'Walker J', 'Mitchell C', 'Machin D', 'Pritchard-Jones K']","['Cancer Section, Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK & UCL Cancer Trials Centre, Cancer Institute, University College London, 90 Tottenham Court Road, London W1T 4TJ, UK.', 'Cancer Section, Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Surgery, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', ""Department of Pathology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK."", ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK."", 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.', ""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK."", 'Cancer Section, Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK.

The pathophysiology of MDS has not been well illustrated. Nevertheless, studies have implicated the MDS phenotype in a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities. In addition to the known numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities, with novel genomic sequencing technologies, approximately 80% of MDS patients have been shown to harbor somatic or acquired gene mutations. The mutations have been found to be related to RNA slicing, transcription regulation, DNA methylation, histone modification, DNA repair/tumor suppressor, signal transduction, and the cohesion complex. The clinical significance of the majority of genetic events has been validated based on a large cohort study that identified mutations as predictors for risk stratification in MDS patients and biomarkers for potential targeted therapies.

We demonstrate that H3K79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) is converted to monomethylation (H3K79me1) at HOX loci as hematopoietic cells mature, thus coinciding with a decrease in HOX gene expression. We show that H3K79 methyltransferase activity as well as H3K79me1-to-H3K79me2 conversion is regulated by the DOT1L cofactor AF10. AF10 inactivation reverses leukemia-associated epigenetic profiles, precludes abnormal HOXA gene expression, and impairs the transforming ability of MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6, and NUP98-NSD1 fusions-mechanistically distinct HOX-activating oncogenes. Furthermore, NUP98-NSD1-transformed cells are sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of DOT1L. Our findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the DOT1L/AF10 complex may provide therapeutic benefits in an array of malignancies with abnormal HOXA gene expression.","['Deshpande, Aniruddha J', 'Deshpande, Anagha', 'Sinha, Amit U', 'Chen, Liying', 'Chang, Jenny', 'Cihan, Ali', 'Fazio, Maurizio', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Zhu, Nan', 'Koche, Richard', 'Dzhekieva, Liuda', 'Ibanez, Gloria', 'Dias, Stuart', 'Banka, Deepti', 'Krivtsov, Andrei', 'Luo, Minkui', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Bradner, James E', 'Bernt, Kathrin M', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Deshpande AJ', 'Deshpande A', 'Sinha AU', 'Chen L', 'Chang J', 'Cihan A', 'Fazio M', 'Chen CW', 'Zhu N', 'Koche R', 'Dzhekieva L', 'Ibanez G', 'Dias S', 'Banka D', 'Krivtsov A', 'Luo M', 'Roeder RG', 'Bradner JE', 'Bernt KM', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Anshutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

Thus many cancers display increases in reactive oxygen like hydrogen peroxide concentrations. To translate this finding into a therapeutic strategy we designed new hydrogen peroxide-activated agents with two key molecular pharmacophores. The first pharmacophore is a peroxide-acceptor and the second is a pendant amine. The acceptor is an N-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)acetamide susceptible to hydrogen peroxide oxidation. We hypothesized that selectivity between AML and normal cells could be achieved by tuning the pendant amine. Synthesis and testing of fourteen compounds that differed at the pendent amine led to the identification of an agent (14) with 2muM activity against AML cancer cells and an eleven fold-lower activity in healthy CD34+ blood stem cells. Interestingly, analysis shows that upon oxidation the pendant amine cyclizes, ejecting water, with the acceptor to give a bicyclic compound capable of reacting with nucleophiles. Preliminary mechanistic investigations show that AML cells made from addition of two oncogenes (NrasG12D and MLL-AF9) increase the ROS-status, is initially an anti-oxidant as hydrogen peroxide is consumed to activate the pro-drug, and cells respond by upregulating electrophilic defense as visualized by Western blotting of KEAP1. Thus, using this chemical approach we have obtained a simple, potent, and selective ROS-activated anti-AML agent.","['Vadukoot, Anish K', 'AbdulSalam, Safnas F', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Pullen, Eboni D', 'Landero-Figueroa, Julio', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Merino, Eddie J']","['Vadukoot AK', 'AbdulSalam SF', 'Wunderlich M', 'Pullen ED', 'Landero-Figueroa J', 'Mulloy JC', 'Merino EJ']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0172, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0172, United States.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0172, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0172, United States.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0172, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141030,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,PMC4292800,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Anti-cancer agent', 'Conjugate addition', 'Oxidative stress', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2014/12/04 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/12/04 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(14)00752-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2014.10.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2014 Dec 15;22(24):6885-92. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2014.10.029.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid growth factor was previously shown to be a regulator for erythropoietic process through activating LPA receptor 3 (LPA3). However, whether LPA affects megakaryopoiesis remains unclear. In this study, we used K562 leukemia cell line as a model to investigate the roles of LPA in MK differentiation. We demonstrated that K562 cells express both LPA2 and LPA3, and the expression levels of LPA2 are higher than LPA3. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a commonly used inducer of megakaryopoiesis, reciprocally regulates the expressions of LPA2 and LPA3. By pharmacological blockers and knockdown experiments, we showed that activation of LPA2 suppresses whereas, LPA3 promotes megakaryocytic differentiation in K562. The LPA2-mediated inhibition is dependent on beta-catenin translocation, whereas reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is a downstream signal for activation of LPA3. Furthermore, the hematopoietic transcriptional factors GATA-1 and FLI-1, appear to be involved in these regulatory mechanisms. Taken together, our results suggested that LPA2 and LPA3 may function as a molecular switch and play opposing roles during megakaryopoiesis of K562 cells.","['Ho, Ya-Hsuan', 'Yao, Chao-Ling', 'Lin, Kuan-Hung', 'Hou, Fen-Han', 'Chen, Wei-Min', 'Chiang, Chi-Ling', 'Lin, Yu-Nung', 'Li, Meng-Wei', 'Lin, Shi-Hung', 'Yang, Ya-Jan', 'Lin, Chu-Cheng', 'Lu, Jenher', 'Tigyi, Gabor', 'Lee, Hsinyu']","['Ho YH', 'Yao CL', 'Lin KH', 'Hou FH', 'Chen WM', 'Chiang CL', 'Lin YN', 'Li MW', 'Lin SH', 'Yang YJ', 'Lin CC', 'Lu J', 'Tigyi G', 'Lee H']","['Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Yuan-Ze University, Chung-Li, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'School of Biomedical Science, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Cardiology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.

HO-1 has major immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects via its cell-type-specific functions in mononuclear cells. Contradictory findings have been reported on HO-1 regulation by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in these cells. Therefore, we reinvestigated the effects of LPS on HO-1 gene expression in human and murine mononuclear cells in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, LPS downregulated HO-1 in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD14(+) monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes, but upregulated this enzyme in primary murine macrophages and human monocytic leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, experiments with human CD14(+) monocytes revealed that activation of other TLRs including TLR1, -2, -5, -6, -8, and -9 decreased HO-1 mRNA expression. LPS-dependent downregulation of HO-1 was specific, because expression of cyclooxygenase-2, NADP(H)-quinone oxidoreductase-1, and peroxiredoxin-1 was increased under the same experimental conditions. Notably, LPS upregulated expression of Bach1, a critical transcriptional repressor of HO-1. Moreover, knockdown of this nuclear factor enhanced basal and LPS-dependent HO-1 expression in mononuclear cells. Finally, downregulation of HO-1 in response to LPS was confirmed in PBMCs from human individuals subjected to experimental endotoxemia. In conclusion, LPS downregulates HO-1 expression in primary human mononuclear cells via a Bach1-mediated pathway. As LPS-dependent HO-1 regulation is cell-type- and species-specific, experimental findings in cell lines and animal models need careful interpretation.","['Dorresteijn, Mirrin J', 'Paine, Ananta', 'Zilian, Eva', 'Fenten, Maaike G E', 'Frenzel, Eileen', 'Janciauskiene, Sabina', 'Figueiredo, Constanca', 'Eiz-Vesper, Britta', 'Blasczyk, Rainer', 'Dekker, Douwe', 'Pennings, Bas', 'Scharstuhl, Alwin', 'Smits, Paul', 'Larmann, Jan', 'Theilmeier, Gregor', 'van der Hoeven, Johannes G', 'Wagener, Frank A D T G', 'Pickkers, Peter', 'Immenschuh, Stephan']","['Dorresteijn MJ', 'Paine A', 'Zilian E', 'Fenten MG', 'Frenzel E', 'Janciauskiene S', 'Figueiredo C', 'Eiz-Vesper B', 'Blasczyk R', 'Dekker D', 'Pennings B', 'Scharstuhl A', 'Smits P', 'Larmann J', 'Theilmeier G', 'van der Hoeven JG', 'Wagener FA', 'Pickkers P', 'Immenschuh S']","['Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Respiratory Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30635 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Respiratory Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30635 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Department of Orthodontics and Craniofacial Biology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Nijmegen Center for Infectious Diseases, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Department of Orthodontics and Craniofacial Biology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Nijmegen Center for Infectious Diseases, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.

Here, we show that RPKK results in a non-infectious vector when placed in not only a PERV envelope, but also the envelope of a related gammaretrovirus, FeLV-B. The amino acid substitutions do not prevent envelope precursor cleavage, viral core and genome assembly, or receptor binding. Rather, the mutations result in the formation of hyperglycosylated glycoprotein and a reduction in the reverse transcribed minus strand synthesis and undetectable 2-LTR circular DNA in cells exposed to vectors with these mutated envelopes. Our findings suggest novel functions associated with the cleavage signal sequence that may affect trafficking through the glycosylation machinery of the cell.

We compared erythroid cells (and their precursor cells) from the mononuclear cell fraction with those from the hematon fraction, which are compacted complexes of hematopoietic cells surrounded by their own micro-environment. In directly fixed materials, erythroblasts exhibited signs of autophagy with limited apoptosis (<3%) based on ultrastructural characteristics and immunogold labeling for activated caspase-3. After 24 h in culture, myelodysplastic erythroblasts exhibited a significant increase in apoptosis (22 +/- 7% vs. 3 +/- 2%, p = 0.001). In contrast, the myelodysplastic erythroblasts from the hematon fraction did not exhibit an increased tendency toward apoptosis after culture (7 +/- 3.3% vs. 1.8 +/- 2.3%), which was in line with results for normal bone marrow cells. The same dependency on the micro-environment was noted for immature erythroid progenitor cells. Myelodysplastic hematons exhibited distinct numbers of erythroid burst-forming units in association with an extensive network of stromal cells, whereas small numbers of erythroid burst-forming units were generated from the myelodysplastic mononuclear cells compared with normal mononuclear cells (10.2 +/- 9 vs. 162 +/- 125, p < 0.001). Co-culture of erythroid myelodysplastic cells in the presence of growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor) or on the MS-5 stromal layer did not restore the expansion of erythroid precursor cells. These data indicate that surviving myelodysplastic erythroid progenitors become more vulnerable to programmed cell death when they are detached from their own micro-environment.","['Folkerts, Hendrik', 'Hazenberg, Carin L E', 'Houwerzijl, Ewout J', 'van den Heuvel, Fiona A J', 'Mulder, Andre B', 'van der Want, Johannes J L', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Folkerts H', 'Hazenberg CL', 'Houwerzijl EJ', 'van den Heuvel FA', 'Mulder AB', 'van der Want JJ', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway."", 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

Every year, there are 15 000 new diagnoses and 5000 CLL deaths in the United States. Although therapeutic choices were once limited, treatment of this disease has vastly improved in the last decade. OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based review of the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of CLL. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched through August 28, 2014. English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 2000-2014 were found using the keywords chronic lymphocytic leukemia, upfront therapy, upfront therapies, upfront therapeutic, upfront therapeutics, upfront treatment, front-line treatment, first-line treatment, front-line treatments, first-line treatments, front-line therapy, front-line therapies, randomized, randomized studies, randomized study, clinical trial, clinical trials, phase 3, and phase 3 clinical trial. Abstracts and presentations at scientific meetings were excluded. A total of 277 articles were retrieved, of which 24 met our predefined selection criteria; treatment recommendations were based on subsequent analysis of these 24 articles. FINDINGS: The Rai and Binet systems for staging CLL were established in 1975 and 1977, respectively. However, they do not account for new disease categories such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (peripheral blood clonal lymphocytosis that does not meet other criteria for CLL). Two subsets of CLL are now recognized based on risk stratification involving molecular and cytogenetic analyses. Outcomes are improved by the addition of immunotherapy to combination chemotherapy for initial treatment in all subsets of treated patients. Overall response rates between 75% and 90% and complete responses between 22% and 45% are expected in the current era, with more than 80% of treated patients alive at 3 years. Overall, 5-year survival has increased to 66% from 60% (P < .001) in the past 10 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard first-line option approach for CLL, the most common leukemia observed in adults. Treatment is initiated when the disease becomes symptomatic, and survival is high following treatment.","['Nabhan, Chadi', 'Rosen, Steven T']","['Nabhan C', 'Rosen ST']","['Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,,,2014/12/03 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1983685 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2014.14553 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2014 Dec 3;312(21):2265-76. doi: 10.1001/jama.2014.14553.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-cell lymphoma (BCL) 2-associated AthanoGene-1 (BAG-1) is a prosurvival chaperone recently found involved in the maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells survival in vitro. Here we reported BAG-1 upregulation in 87 of 99 analyzed AML patients with respect to healthy control samples applying reverse phase protein assay. Silencing of BAG-1 expression confirmed a decreased BCL-2 protein level but, in addition, provoked the increased transcription of GADD34 stress sensor. Furthermore, a dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha, as well as alteration of expression of IRE-1 and CHOP proteins, were documented, suggesting that a disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response was provoked by downregulation of BAG-1. A similar phenomenon was triggered after addition of Thioflavin S, which was shown to block BAG-1/BCL-2 interaction and to increase cell death, enforcing a prosurvival role of the BAG-1 protein in AML. Interestingly, synergic cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, VP16 drugs, and ABT-737 compound were observed when Thioflavin S was coupled with these drugs. Taken together, our results gave further proof that upregulation of BAG-1 plays a critical role in AML and that BAG-1 targeting might be considered for a combined therapeutic strategy with conventional chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of AML patients.","['Aveic, Sanja', 'Viola, Giampietro', 'Accordi, Benedetta', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Pigazzi, Martina']","['Aveic S', 'Viola G', 'Accordi B', 'Micalizzi C', 'Santoro N', 'Masetti R', 'Locatelli F', 'Basso G', 'Pigazzi M']","['Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica (IRP), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.

Among newly developed nucleoside antimetabolites, clofarabine has broad cytotoxic activity showing therapeutic promise and is currently approved for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for clofarabine resistance, we established two clofarabine-resistant lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines from parental lines. To elucidate the mechanisms against clofarabine resistance in two newly established clofarabine-resistant cell lines, we measured the expression of export pumps multidrug resistance protein 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2. There were no differences in the expression between clofarabine-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Next, we determined expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which phosphorylates clofarabine to exert cytotoxicity, in clofarabine-sensitive and -resistant cells. Clofarabine-resistant cells showed significantly decreased expression of dCK RNA when compared with sensitive cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of decreased dCK expression in clofarabine-resistant cells, we analyzed the methylation status of CpG islands of the dCK promoter and found no differences in methylation status between clofarabine-sensitive and -resistant cells. Next, we measured the acetylation status of histone and found that total histone acetylation, and histone H3 and H4 acetylation on chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were significantly decreased in resistant cells. Melatonin is an indolamine that functions in the regulation of chronobiological rhythms to exert cytotoxic effects. We examined the effects of melatonin in clofarabine-resistant cells and found that melatonin treatment led to significantly increased cytotoxicity with clofarabine in resistant cells via increased acetylation. Melatonin may be a useful candidate for overcoming clofarabine resistance in two newly established clofarabine resistant leukemia cell lines.","['Yamanishi, Miho', 'Narazaki, Hidehiko', 'Asano, Takeshi']","['Yamanishi M', 'Narazaki H', 'Asano T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, Inzai, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, Inzai, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, Inzai, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify key routes of exposure to organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in California women of reproductive age. METHODS: Blood was collected from 48 mothers participating in the California Childhood Leukemia Study from 2006 to 2007 and analyzed for POPs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariable linear regression models of natural-log transformed serum concentrations were used to identify determinants of exposure from available questionnaire information on dietary habits, reproductive history, and demographic characteristics, as well as vacuum cleaner dust-POP levels. RESULTS: After adjusting for blood lipid levels, age, body mass index, cumulative lactation, and sampling date, serum concentrations of multiple major PCBs were positively associated with fish consumption, but not dust-PCB levels. After adjusting for blood lipid levels, Hispanic ethnicity, country of origin, and household annual income, serum concentrations of multiple major PBDEs were positively associated with dust-PBDE levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the relative contribution of specific exposure routes to total POP intake varies by chemical class, with dust being a relatively important source of PBDEs and diet being a relatively important source of PCBs.","['Whitehead, Todd P', 'Crispo Smith, Sabrina', 'Park, June-Soo', 'Petreas, Myrto X', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Metayer, Catherine']","['Whitehead TP', 'Crispo Smith S', 'Park JS', 'Petreas MX', 'Rappaport SM', 'Metayer C']","['School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, 50 University Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.

Most reported cases of splenic abscesses occur after chemotherapy and are related to the immunosuppressive effects of the chemotherapy. Their etiology is most frequently fungal. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 58-year-old male presented with splenomegaly and scrotal swelling secondary to a multibacterial splenic abscess which required a splenectomy. Upon investigation he was found to suffer from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and epididymitis. DISCUSSION: Splenic abscesses are rarely found in leukemic patients. Reported cases are fungal and commonly occur after chemotherapy due to immunosuppression. Scrotal swelling with concurrent splenomegaly can be found in other pathologies including brucellosis, Lyme disease and even non-Hodgkin primary testicular lymphoma. Scrotal swelling in our case was likely secondary to epididymitis and exacerbated by the effects of splenomegaly upon the systemic circulation promoting venous congestion. CONCLUSION: This case illustrated an unusual presentation of CML because the patient presented with splenomegaly, a multibacterial splenic abscess, and scrotal swelling.","['McPhillips, Sean', 'Friese, Randall', 'Vercruysse, Gary']","['McPhillips S', 'Friese R', 'Vercruysse G']","['Department of Surgery, University of Arizona, 1501 North Campbell Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.

From 2007 to 2009, 79 UCBT recipients were enrolled. Patients who underwent transplantation in first complete remission (CR1) (n = 48) had a higher frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics and secondary AML and required more induction courses of chemotherapy to achieve CR1 compared with the others. The median infused total nucleated cells (TNC) was 3.4 x 10(7)/kg, 60% received double UCBT, 77% were HLA mismatched (4/6), and 40% had major ABO incompatibility. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 60 was 87% and the cumulative incidence of 100-day acute graft-versus-host disease (II to IV) was 50%. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of NRM and relapse was 20% and 46%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, major ABO incompatibility (P = .001) and TNC (<3.4 x 10(7)/kg; P = .001) were associated with increased NRM, and use of 2 or more induction courses to obtain CR1 was associated with increased relapse incidence (P = .04). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years was 35%, and the only factor associated with decreased LFS was secondary AML (P = .04). In conclusion, despite the decreased NRM observed, other RIC regimens with higher myelosuppression should be evaluated to decrease relapse in high-risk AML.

We studied outcomes of 1788 AML patients relapsing after alloHCT (1990 to 2010) during first or second complete remission (CR) to identify factors associated with longer postrelapse survival. Median time to post-HCT relapse was 7 months (range, 1 to 177). At relapse, 1231 patients (69%) received intensive therapy, including chemotherapy alone (n = 660), donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) +/- chemotherapy (n = 202), or second alloHCT +/- chemotherapy +/- DLI (n = 369), with subsequent CR rates of 29%. Median follow-up after relapse was 39 months (range, <1 to 193). Survival for all patients was 23% at 1 year after relapse; however, 3-year overall survival correlated with time from HCT to relapse (4% for relapse during the 1- to 6-month period, 12% during the 6-month to 2-year period, 26% during the 2- to 3-year period, and 38% for >/=3 years). In multivariable analysis, lower mortality was significantly associated with longer time from alloHCT to relapse (relative risk, .55 for 6 months to 2 years; relative risk, .39 for 2 to 3 years; and relative risk, .28 for >/=3 years; P < .0001) and a first HCT using reduced-intensity conditioning (relative risk, .77; 95% confidence interval [CI], .66 to .88; P = .0002). In contrast, inferior survival was associated with age >40 years (relative risk, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.64; P < .0001), active graft-versus-host disease at relapse (relative risk, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.39; P < .0001), adverse cytogenetics (relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.71; P = .0062), mismatched unrelated donor (relative risk, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.13; P = .0008), and use of cord blood for first HCT (relative risk, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.42; P = .0078).

Regardless, CLL cells secrete high levels of major angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Nonetheless, it remains unclear how most angiogenic factors regulate accumulation and delayed apoptosis of CLL cells. Angiogenic factors such as leptin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), follistatin, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), angiogenin (ANG), midkine (MK), pleiotrophin (PTN), progranulin (PGRN), proliferin (PLF), placental growth factor (PIGF), and endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), represent novel therapeutic targets of future CLL research but have remained widely overlooked.

CLINICAL FINDINGS: A CBC revealed severe leukocytosis (39,100 leukocytes/muL) and marked lymphocytosis (90%). A blood smear consisted predominantly of intermediate-sized lymphocytes and few large lymphocytes, with mild to moderate nuclear atypia. These findings were highly suggestive of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Cytologic evaluation of bone marrow aspirates revealed no evidence of overt malignancy, with 10% of all cells identified as small to intermediate-sized mature lymphocytes. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Treatment with chlorambucil and prednisone administered orally over a 1.8-year period decreased the leukocyte and lymphocyte counts to within reference intervals with no adverse effects. Although repeated flow cytometry revealed evidence of residual disease, the fox remained free of clinical disease, and WBC counts were within reference intervals for this species. At 22 months after initial evaluation, the fox was euthanized because of debilitating arthritis. No evidence of CLL was detected grossly or histologically during necropsy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To the authors' knowledge, this was the first report of CLL in a bat-eared fox and first successful treatment in a nondomestic carnivore. Treatment in accordance with a chemotherapeutic protocol successfully resolved the leukocytosis and lymphocytosis with no serious adverse effects. Description of this fox and the treatment protocol should provide a valuable reference for future cases in this and other nondomestic canine species.","['Nevitt, Benjamin N', 'Langan, Jennifer N', 'Adkesson, Michael J', 'Landolfi, Jennifer A', 'Wilson, Rand']","['Nevitt BN', 'Langan JN', 'Adkesson MJ', 'Landolfi JA', 'Wilson R']","['Illinois Zoological and Aquatic Animal Residency Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61802.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,,,,2014/12/03 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/javma.245.12.1391 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2014 Dec 15;245(12):1391-5. doi: 10.2460/javma.245.12.1391.,,IM,"['Animals', '*Animals, Zoo', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Foxes', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective data from 81 children less than 18 years of age with CML identified in the French pediatric registry were analysed. Height was expressed as standard deviation score (SDS). RESULTS: A gradual decrease in height SDS was observed over time since starting imatinib. The height SDS was significantly lower 12 months and 24 months after the start of imatinib overall (p < 10(-4)) irrespective of gender and pubertal age. The height SDS was significantly (p < 10(-4)) lower 12 months after the start of imatinib in boys and girls, and in the prepubertal age group as well as in the postpubertal age group, respectively. A similar finding was observed in the subgroups of boys and girls starting imatinib at a prepubertal or postpubertal age. Loss in height SDS 12 months after the start of imatinib was of the same range in boys when compared to girls and in patients who started imatinib at a prepubertal age compared to those who started at a postpubertal age.

Studies of cancer viruses soon became the second most highly funded area of research at the Institute, and by far the most generously funded area of biological research. Remarkably, this vast infrastructure for cancer vaccine production came into being before a human leukemia virus was shown to exist. The origins of the SVLP were rooted in as much as shifts in American society as laboratory science. The revival of cancer virus studies was a function of the success advocates and administrators achieved in associating cancer viruses with campaigns against childhood diseases such as polio and leukemia. To address the urgency borne of this new association, the SVLP's architects sought to lessen the power of peer review in favor of centralized Cold War management methods, fashioning viruses as ""administrative objects"" in order to accelerate the tempo of biomedical research and discovery.","['Scheffler, Robin Wolfe']",['Scheffler RW'],"['American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 136 Irving Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA. rscheffler@amacad.org']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141024,England,Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci,Studies in history and philosophy of biological and biomedical sciences,9810965,,,,2014/12/03 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S1369-8486(14)00140-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.shpsc.2014.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci. 2014 Dec;48 Pt B:231-49. doi: 10.1016/j.shpsc.2014.09.005.

The dimeric derivative of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borinate (2-APB), DPB162-AE, blocks functional coupling between STIM1 and Orai1 with an IC50 (200 nM) 100-fold lower than 2-APB. Unlike 2-APB, DPB162-AE does not affect L-type or TRPC channels or Ca(2+) pumps at maximal STIM1-Orai1 blocking levels. DPB162-AE blocks STIM1-induced Orai1 or Orai2, but does not block Orai3 or STIM2-mediated effects. We narrowed the DPB162-AE site of action to the STIM-Orai activating region (SOAR) of STIM1. DPB162-AE does not prevent the SOAR-Orai1 interaction but potently blocks SOAR-mediated Orai1 channel activation, yet its action is not as an Orai1 channel pore blocker. Using the SOAR-F394H mutant which prevents both physical and functional coupling to Orai1, we reveal DPB162-AE rapidly restores SOAR-Orai binding but only slowly restores Orai1 channel-mediated Ca(2+) entry. With the same SOAR mutant, 2-APB induces rapid physical and functional coupling to Orai1, but channel activation is transient. We infer that the actions of both 2-APB and DPB162-AE are directed toward the STIM1-Orai1 coupling interface. Compared to 2-APB, DPB162-AE is a much more potent and specific STIM1/Orai1 functional uncoupler.

We identified the homologous recombination-mediated repair (HRR) gene, Rad51b, as a downstream molecule of the miR-590/Acvr2a pathway regulating the SSB and DSB damage repair and cell cycle.

Available protocols rely on overexpression of transcription factors using integrative vectors and are often slow, complex, and inefficient. We report a fast and efficient approach for generating induced neural cells (iNCs) directly from human hematopoietic cells using Sendai virus. Upon SOX2 and c-MYC expression, CD133-positive cord blood cells rapidly adopt a neuroepithelial morphology and exhibit high expansion capacity. Under defined neurogenic culture conditions, they express mature neuronal markers and fire spontaneous action potentials that can be modulated with neurotransmitters. SOX2 and c-MYC are also sufficient to convert peripheral blood mononuclear cells into iNCs. However, the conversion process is less efficient and resulting iNCs have limited expansion capacity and electrophysiological activity upon differentiation. Our study demonstrates rapid and efficient generation of iNCs from hematopoietic cells while underscoring the impact of target cells on conversion efficiency.","['Castano, Julio', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Bruzos-Cidon, Cristina', 'Straccia, Marco', 'Sousa, Amaia', 'Zabaleta, Lorea', 'Vazquez, Nerea', 'Zubiarrain, Amaia', 'Sonntag, Kai-Christian', 'Ugedo, Luisa', 'Carvajal-Vergara, Xonia', 'Canals, Josep Maria', 'Torrecilla, Maria', 'Sanchez-Pernaute, Rosario', 'Giorgetti, Alessandra']","['Castano J', 'Menendez P', 'Bruzos-Cidon C', 'Straccia M', 'Sousa A', 'Zabaleta L', 'Vazquez N', 'Zubiarrain A', 'Sonntag KC', 'Ugedo L', 'Carvajal-Vergara X', 'Canals JM', 'Torrecilla M', 'Sanchez-Pernaute R', 'Giorgetti A']","['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Cell Therapy Program of the University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Cell Therapy Program of the University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona 08010, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa 48940, Spain.', ""Department of Cell Biology, Immunology and Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain; Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Barcelona 08036, Spain."", 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neural Repair, Inbiomed, San Sebastian 20009, Spain.', 'Cell Reprogramming and Differentiation Platform, Inbiomed, San Sebastian 20009, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neural Repair, Inbiomed, San Sebastian 20009, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neural Repair, Inbiomed, San Sebastian 20009, Spain; Cell Reprogramming and Differentiation Platform, Inbiomed, San Sebastian 20009, Spain.', 'Department of Psychiatry, McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Belmont, MA 02478, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa 48940, Spain.', 'Cell Reprogramming and Differentiation Platform, Inbiomed, San Sebastian 20009, Spain.', ""Department of Cell Biology, Immunology and Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain; Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Barcelona 08036, Spain."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa 48940, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Neural Repair, Inbiomed, San Sebastian 20009, Spain.

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic role of Bmi-1 expression in solid cancers. Studies were recruited by searching PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Thirty-nine articles including 40 studies were involved in this meta-analysis. Our results indicated that the Bmi-1 showed the opposite prognostic effect in Asian and Caucasian populations. High Bmi-1 expression as a negative predictor for overall survival (OS) in Asian patients (HR=1.96, 95% CI 1.62-2.36), but a positive predictor in Caucasian populations (HR=0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.93). Furthermore, we took a further subgroup analysis based on tumor type in these two populations, respectively. In Asian cases, high expression of Bmi-1 was associated with poor OS in oesophageal carcinoma (HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.52-2.46), gastric cancer (HR=1.50, 95% CI 1.22-1.85), lung cancer (HR=1.73, 95% CI 1.05-2.85), cervical cancer (HR=2.80, 95% CI 2.26-3.47) and colorectal cancer (HR=3.36, 95% CI 2.19-5.15), rather than in breast cancer and HCC. In Caucasian populations, high expression of Bmi-1 was associated with better OS in breast cancer (HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.97), but it showed no significance in oesophageal carcinoma. In conclusion, high Bmi-1 expression was significantly associated with poor survival in Asian patients with oesophageal carcinoma, gastric cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and cervical carcinoma, whereas high level of Bmi-1 can predict better prognosis in Caucasian patients with breast cancer.","['Shao, Yingjie', 'Geng, Yiting', 'Gu, Wendong', 'Ning, Zhonghua', 'Jiang, Jingting', 'Pei, Honglei']","['Shao Y', 'Geng Y', 'Gu W', 'Ning Z', 'Jiang J', 'Pei H']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 185 Juqian Street, Changzhou 213003, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 185 Juqian Street, Changzhou 213003, PR China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 185 Juqian Street, Changzhou 213003, PR China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 185 Juqian Street, Changzhou 213003, PR China.', 'Department of Tumor Biological Treatment, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 185 Juqian Street, Changzhou 213003, PR China.

Because most of these studies were performed in China, Chinese published clinical studies were used for the analysis. A search for studies from 2006 to 2013 of regimens containing HHT for AML treatment was performed using published studies and Chinese databases in Mandarin. The complete response (CR) and overall response (OR) rates were analyzed, and the fixed effects model and random effects model (REM) were calculated. The heterogeneity of the studies was calculated using Q homogeneity statistics. The meta-analysis included 21 studies (n = 1310, n = 229 pediatric, and n = 216 elderly). HHT was given in combination with cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, aclacinomycin, mitoxantrone, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Heterogeneity was seen in all analyzed pools, but it was most pronounced in retrospective studies. Overall, the REM showed a CR rate of 65.2%. However, in studies in which HHT-containing regimens were compared to regimens without HHT, the CR rates were 69.1% in randomized trials and 62.8% in retrospective studies. Additionally, in studies with exclusively elderly patients, the CR rate was considerably lower than it was for the studies with mixed age populations (47.5% vs. 65.2%). Higher overall CR rates for HHT-containing regimens in AML treatment in the Chinese studies suggest that HHT could be an active agent in the management of AML. Additional clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of HHT in AML treatment.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Barnes, Gisoo', 'Pathak, Ashutosh', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jabbour E', 'Barnes G', 'Pathak A', 'Cortes J']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

We investigated the influence of these scores for 350 patients who underwent transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The HCT-CI scores were grouped as 0 to 2 and >/= 3 (231 and 119 patients, respectively) and the mEBMT scores as 0 to 2 and >/= 3 (166 and 184 patients, respectively). RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a significant association between the HCT-CI score and overall survival (OS) (P = .01), as did the mEBMT score (P = .002). The 5-year OS rate was 50% and 34% for a mEBMT score of 0 to 2 and >/= 3, respectively. A subgroup of patients with a mEBMT score of 0 to 1 (n = 32) demonstrated a favorable OS of 75% at 5 years. This subgroup was younger (median age, 31 years), in first remission at transplantation, and had related donors. For the HCT-CI, the 5-year OS was 46% and 34% for a score of 0 to 2 and >/= 3, respectively. Patients with an HCT-CI score of 0 (n = 94) had a 5-year OS of 44%. Multivariable analysis confirmed both the HCT-CI score and the mEBMT score, as previously grouped, as independent prognostic variables for both OS (P = .02 and P = .001, respectively) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (P = .01 and P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study have demonstrated that the HCT-CI and mEBMT are both prognostic for OS and NRM in our cohort. However, the mEBMT score can identify a favorable-risk subgroup of patients not identifiable using the HCT-CI.","['Michelis, Fotios V', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Uhm, Jieun', 'Alam, Naheed', 'Lambie, Anna', 'McGillis, Laura', 'Seftel, Matthew D', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Kuruvilla, John', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Michelis FV', 'Messner HA', 'Uhm J', 'Alam N', 'Lambie A', 'McGillis L', 'Seftel MD', 'Gupta V', 'Kuruvilla J', 'Lipton JH', 'Kim DD']","['Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

However, the potential role of NPM involved in drug-resistance in leukemia has not been investigated clearly. In this study, we generated an adriamycin (ADM)-resistant lymphoblastic cell line Molt-4/ADR (MAR) by stepwise induction. Cell proliferation, sensitivity to chemotherapy agents and expressions of drug resistance related molecules were assessed. The IC50 of Molt-4 cells were 0.58+/-0.11mumol/L and MAR cells were 22.56+/-1.94mumol/L, meaning MAR cells were 38.63 fold resistant to Molt-4 cells. Furthermore, MAR cells gained an expression of mdr-1 (P-gp) and a higher expression of NPM compared to Molt-4 cells. Knockdown of NPM by RNA interference (RNAi) suppressed the viability of both Molt-4 and MAR cells. After NPM RNAi, the IC50 of MAR and Molt-4 cells were 3.83+/-0.38mumol/L and 0.19+/-0.02mumol/L respectively. Both of them revealed an increase of drug sensitivity with down-regulation of mdr-1 and Akt/mTOR signaling. Knockdown of mdr-1 could also reverse the drug resistance, with no change in NPM expression. It could be concluded that knockdown of NPM reversed the drug resistance by down-regulating P-gp and Akt/mTOR signal pathway, indicating that NPM may serve as a potential modulator in drug resistance.","['Wang, Lingyan', 'Chen, Buyuan', 'Lin, Minhui', 'Cao, Yanqin', 'Chen, Yingyu', 'Chen, Xinji', 'Liu, Tingbo', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Wang L', 'Chen B', 'Lin M', 'Cao Y', 'Chen Y', 'Chen X', 'Liu T', 'Hu J']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian, China.

GIST of the small intestine (I-GIST) show more aggressive behavior than those of the stomach (S-GIST), and the molecular background of the malignancy in I-GIST may include potential prognostic biomarkers. We conducted integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to identify genes showing differential expressions according to the tumor site. We generated protein expression profiles for four cases each of surgically resected I-GIST and S-GIST using label-free proteomic analysis. For proteins showing differential expressions, global mRNA expression was compared between 9 I-GIST and 23 S-GIST. Among the 2555 genes analyzed, we found that promyelocytic leukemia (PML), a tumor suppressor gene, was significantly downregulated in I-GIST at both the protein and mRNA levels (P < 0.01; fold difference >/=2.0). Immunohistochemistry of 254 additional cases from multiple clinical facilities showed that PML-negative cases were significantly frequent in the I-GIST group (P < 0.001). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was significantly lower in the PML-negative than in the PML-positive cases (60.1% vs 91.7%; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that downregulation of PML was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor (hazard ratio = 2.739; P = 0.001).

Because Parkin mutations occur in Parkinson's disease, a condition associated with the death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, wild-type Parkin is thought to promote neuronal survival. However, here we show that wild-type Parkin greatly sensitized toward apoptosis induced by mitochondrial depolarization but not by proapoptotic stimuli that failed to activate Parkin. Parkin-dependent apoptosis required PINK1 and was efficiently blocked by prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family or knockdown of Bax and Bak. Upon mitochondrial depolarization, the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 underwent rapid Parkin- and PINK1-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation, which sensitized toward apoptosis via opening of the Bax/Bak channel. These data suggest that similar to other sensors of cell stress, such as p53, Parkin has cytoprotective (mitophagy) or cytotoxic modes (apoptosis), depending on the degree of mitochondrial damage.","['Carroll, Richard G', 'Hollville, Emilie', 'Martin, Seamus J']","['Carroll RG', 'Hollville E', 'Martin SJ']","['Molecular Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Genetics, The Smurfit Institute, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'Molecular Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Genetics, The Smurfit Institute, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'Molecular Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Genetics, The Smurfit Institute, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.

Although Stat5 has been implicated in regulating several myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, how precisely Stat5 regulates leukemogenesis, including its nuclear translocation to induce gene transcription, is poorly understood. In leukemic cells, we show constitutive activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) whose inhibition represses leukemogenesis. Downstream of FAK, activation of Rac1 is regulated by RacGEF Tiam1, whose inhibition prolongs the survival of leukemic mice. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 prolongs the survival of leukemic mice in part by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of Stat5. These results reveal a leukemic pathway involving FAK/Tiam1/Rac1/PAK1 and demonstrate an essential role for these signaling molecules in regulating the nuclear translocation of Stat5 in leukemogenesis.","['Chatterjee, Anindya', 'Ghosh, Joydeep', 'Ramdas, Baskar', 'Mali, Raghuveer Singh', 'Martin, Holly', 'Kobayashi, Michihiro', 'Vemula, Sasidhar', 'Canela, Victor H', 'Waskow, Emily R', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Tiu, Ramon V', 'Smith, Catherine C', 'Shah, Neil', 'Bunting, Kevin D', 'Boswell, H Scott', 'Liu, Yan', 'Chan, Rebecca J', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Chatterjee A', 'Ghosh J', 'Ramdas B', 'Mali RS', 'Martin H', 'Kobayashi M', 'Vemula S', 'Canela VH', 'Waskow ER', 'Visconte V', 'Tiu RV', 'Smith CC', 'Shah N', 'Bunting KD', 'Boswell HS', 'Liu Y', 'Chan RJ', 'Kapur R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.

This is relevant to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where aggressiveness and therapeutic responsiveness can be influenced by the initial stage of transformation. To address this, we generated a mouse model in which the mixed-lineage leukemia/eleven-nineteen-leukemia (MLL-ENL) transcription factor can be conditionally activated in any cell type. We show that AML can originate from multiple hematopoietic progenitor subsets with granulocytic and monocytic potential, and that the normal developmental position of leukemia-initiating cells influences leukemic development. However, disease failed to arise from HSCs. Although it maintained or upregulated the expression of target genes associated with leukemic development, MLL-ENL dysregulated the proliferative and repopulating capacity of HSCs. Therefore, the permissiveness for development of AML may be associated with a narrower window of differentiation than was previously appreciated, and hijacking the self-renewal capacity of HSCs by a potent oncogene is insufficient for leukemic development.","['Ugale, Amol', 'Norddahl, Gudmundur L', 'Wahlestedt, Martin', 'Sawen, Petter', 'Jaako, Pekka', 'Pronk, Cornelis Jan', 'Soneji, Shamit', 'Cammenga, Jorg', 'Bryder, David']","['Ugale A', 'Norddahl GL', 'Wahlestedt M', 'Sawen P', 'Jaako P', 'Pronk CJ', 'Soneji S', 'Cammenga J', 'Bryder D']","['Immunology Section, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center D14, Lund University, Klinikgatan 32, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Immunology Section, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center D14, Lund University, Klinikgatan 32, 221 84 Lund, Sweden; Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Immunology Section, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center D14, Lund University, Klinikgatan 32, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Immunology Section, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center D14, Lund University, Klinikgatan 32, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Immunology Section, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center D14, Lund University, Klinikgatan 32, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Immunology Section, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center D14, Lund University, Klinikgatan 32, 221 84 Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Biomedical Center B10, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Biomedical Center A12, Lund University, 221 84 Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Biomedical Center B10, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Biomedical Center A12, Lund University, 221 84 Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Biomedical Center B10, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.', 'Immunology Section, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Biomedical Center D14, Lund University, Klinikgatan 32, 221 84 Lund, Sweden; Lund Stem Cell Center, Biomedical Center B10, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize clinical and histopathologic features of ATLL in patients with skin involvement. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with ATLL from a single institution given a diagnosis during a 15-year period (1998-2013). Patients were categorized by the Shimoyama classification and stratified into skin-first, skin-second, and skin-uninvolved courses. RESULTS: The study population included 17 skin-first, 8 skin-second, and 29 skin-uninvolved cases. Skin-first patients (6 acute, 1 lymphoma, 4 chronic, 6 smoldering) were overwhelmingly of Caribbean origin (94%). They had longer median symptom duration (11.9 vs 1.9 months, P < .001) and overall survival (26.7 vs 10.0 months, P < .001) compared with skin-second/skin-uninvolved patients. Cutaneous lesion morphology at diagnosis included nodulotumoral (35%), multipapular (24%), plaques (24%), patches (12%), and erythroderma (6%). After initial skin biopsy, 14 of 17 received a non-ATLL diagnosis, most commonly mycosis fungoides (47%). Notable histopathologic findings from 43 biopsy specimens included greater than or equal to 20:1 CD4:CD8 ratio (79%), angiocentrism (78%), CD25(+) (71%), large cell morphology (70%), CD30(+) (68%), epidermal infiltration of atypical lymphocytes (67%) forming large Pautrier-like microabscesses (55%), and folliculotropism (65%). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective, single-center, tertiary referral center study with small sample size. CONCLUSION: Skin-first patients with ATLL in the United States are diagnostically challenging. Familiarity with clinicopathologic features may aid in diagnosis.","['Marchetti, Michael A', 'Pulitzer, Melissa P', 'Myskowski, Patricia L', 'Dusza, Stephen W', 'Lunning, Matthew A', 'Horwitz, Steven M', 'Moskowitz, Alison J', 'Querfeld, Christiane']","['Marchetti MA', 'Pulitzer MP', 'Myskowski PL', 'Dusza SW', 'Lunning MA', 'Horwitz SM', 'Moskowitz AJ', 'Querfeld C']","['Dermatology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Dermatopathology Service, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Dermatology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Dermatology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Dermatology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the result of 22 pregnancies in 14 patients (9 female and 5 male) who conceived or their partner conceived while being on tyrosine kinase inhibitors for their CML. RESULTS: All pregnancies except one were uneventful. 25 newborns were born and except in one case where small atrial septal defect was diagnosed, all infants were healthy and showed normal development after birth. CONCLUSION: This small series does indicate that parents can most likely expect an uneventful outcome to a pregnancy despite exposure of either partner to TKIs. There is no consensus or guideline regarding the best practice in case of pregnancy. More reports of similar nature would certainly be beneficial to practitioners and patients alike. As such it is still recommended to practice effective contraception during the period of TKI treatment.","['Alizadeh, H', 'Jaafar, H', 'Rajnics, P', 'Khan, M I', 'Kajtar, B']","['Alizadeh H', 'Jaafar H', 'Rajnics P', 'Khan MI', 'Kajtar B']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Haematology-Oncology, Kaposi Mor Teaching Hospital in affiliation with Pecs University, Kaposvar, Hungary; Department of Oncology, Tawam Hospital in affiliation with Johns Hopkins Medicine, AlAin, United Arab Emirates; Department of Haematology, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland.

It is important to recognize the shift in clinical practice from transplantation of bone marrow (BM) to PBPC occurred largely without adequate clinical data to support the change. It is presumed the change in clinical practice is attributed to results of randomized clinical trials in the setting of HLA-matched sibling transplantations. The results of these trials showed better engraftment but increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with PBPC and possibly better survival for advanced leukemia. However, the results of HLA-matched sibling transplants may differ from that after unrelated donor transplants. There is greater genetic diversity between unrelated adult donors and their recipients and therefore greater risks of GVHD even if the donor and recipient are fully HLA-matched. This review explores the relative merits of transplantation of PBPC relative to BM for myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning unrelated donor transplantation for hematologic cancers in adults.","['Eapen, Mary']",['Eapen M'],"['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.

Additionally, survival rates at 3-5 years after transplant appear to be generally similar following matched related, matched unrelated, single antigen mismatched unrelated, double cord blood and, perhaps even after haplo-identical transplants.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cancer genome/exome resequencing has identified numerous recurrently mutated genes with an average of 5 mutations in each case of de novo AML. In order for these multiple mutations to accumulate in a single lineage of cells, they are serially acquired in clones of self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), termed pre-leukemic HSC. Isolation and characterization of pre-leukemic HSC have shown that their mutations are enriched in genes involved in regulating DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and the cohesin complex. On the other hand, genes involved in regulating activated signaling are generally absent. Pre-leukemic HSC have been found to persist in clinical remission and may ultimately give rise to relapsed disease through the acquisition of novel mutations. Thus, pre-leukemic HSC may constitute a key cellular reservoir that must be eradicated for long-term cures.","['Majeti, Ravindra']",['Majeti R'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, USA.

METHODS: The cohort consisted of 2897 Areva-NC-Pierrelatte plant workers, followed from 1st January 1968 through 31st December 2006 (79,892 person-years). Mortality was compared with that of the French population, by calculating Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI95%). External radiation exposure was reconstructed using external dosimetry archives. Internal uranium exposure was assessed using a plant-specific job-exposure-matrix, considering six types of uranium compounds according to their nature (natural and reprocessed uranium [RPU] and solubility [fast-F, moderate-M, and slow-S]). Exposure-effect analyses were performed for causes of death known to be related to external radiation exposure (all cancers and circulatory system diseases) and cancer of uranium target-organs (lung and hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, HLT). RESULTS: A significant deficit of mortality from all causes (SMR=0.58; CI95% [0.53-0.63]), all cancers (SMR=0.72; CI95% [0.63-0.82]) and smoking related cancers was observed. Non-significant 30%-higher increase of mortality was observed for cancer of pleura (SMR=2.32; CI95 % [0.75-5.41]), rectum and HLT, notably non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR=1.38; CI95 % [0.63-2.61]) and chronic lymphoid leukemia (SMR=2.36; CI95% [0.64-6.03]). No exposure-effect relationship was found with external radiation cumulative dose. A significant exposure-effect relationship was observed for slowly soluble uranium, particularly RPU, which was associated with an increase in mortality risk reaching 8 to 16% per unit of cumulative exposure score and 10 to 15% per year of exposure duration. CONCLUSION: The Areva-NC-Pierrelatte workers cohort presents a non-significant over-mortality from HLT cancers, notably of lymphoid origin, unrelated to external radiation exposure. The pilot study suggests an association between mortality from the HLT and lung cancers and exposure to slowly soluble RPU compounds. The results of this study should be investigated further in more powerful studies, with a dose-response analysis based on individual assessment of uranium absorbed dose to uranium-target organs.","['Guseva Canu, I', 'Zhivin, S', 'Garsi, J-P', 'Caer-Lorho, S', 'Samson, E', 'Collomb, P', 'Acker, A', 'Laurier, D']","['Guseva Canu I', 'Zhivin S', 'Garsi JP', 'Caer-Lorho S', 'Samson E', 'Collomb P', 'Acker A', 'Laurier D']","[""Institut de radioprotection et de surete nucleaire, IRSN/PRP-HOM/SRBE/LEPID, laboratoire d'epidemiologie des rayonnements ionisants, BP 17, 92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses cedex, France; Institut de veille sanitaire (InVS), departement sante travail (DST), 94415 Saint-Maurice cedex, France.

By adapting the small hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology, we inactivated endogenous p53 in primary epithelial cells from the epidermis of human skin. We show that either loss of endogenous p53 or overexpression of a temperature-sensitive dominant-negative conformation triggers a self-protective differentiation response, resulting in cell stratification and expulsion. These effects follow DNA damage and exit from mitosis without cell division. p53 preserves the proliferative potential of the stem cell compartment and limits the power of proto-oncogene MYC to drive cell cycle stress and differentiation. The results provide insight into the role of p53 in self-renewal homeostasis and help explain why p53 mutations do not initiate skin cancer but increase the likelihood that cancer cells will appear.","['Freije, Ana', 'Molinuevo, Rut', 'Ceballos, Laura', 'Cagigas, Marta', 'Alonso-Lecue, Pilar', 'Rodriguez, Rene', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Aberdam, Daniel', 'De Diego, Ernesto', 'Gandarillas, Alberto']","['Freije A', 'Molinuevo R', 'Ceballos L', 'Cagigas M', 'Alonso-Lecue P', 'Rodriguez R', 'Menendez P', 'Aberdam D', 'De Diego E', 'Gandarillas A']","['Cell Cycle, Stem Cell Fate and Cancer Laboratory, Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander 39011, Spain.', 'Cell Cycle, Stem Cell Fate and Cancer Laboratory, Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander 39011, Spain.', 'Cell Cycle, Stem Cell Fate and Cancer Laboratory, Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander 39011, Spain.', 'Cell Cycle, Stem Cell Fate and Cancer Laboratory, Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander 39011, Spain.', 'Cell Cycle, Stem Cell Fate and Cancer Laboratory, Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander 39011, Spain.', 'Lab 2-ORL, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia de Asturias (IUOPA) Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), Oviedo 33006, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Avenida Lluis Companys, Barcelona 08010, Spain.', 'INSERM UMR-S976, University Paris Didero, Hopital Saint-Louis, Equerre Bazin, Paris 75475, France.', 'Cell Cycle, Stem Cell Fate and Cancer Laboratory, Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander 39011, Spain; Paediatric Surgery, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla (HUMV), Santander 39011, Spain.', 'Cell Cycle, Stem Cell Fate and Cancer Laboratory, Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander 39011, Spain; INSERM, Languedoc-Roussillon, Montpellier 34394, France.

METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive and quantitative study was performed based on clinical, laboratory and nutritional data obtained from medical records of adult patients of both genders submitted to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a bone marrow transplantation reference center in Rio de Janeiro in the period from 2010 to 2013. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software (version 22.0). RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were evaluated. The mean age was 42.1+/-3.2 years and the most prevalent disease was acute myeloid leukemia (39%). There was a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea (100%), vomiting (97%) and mucositis (93%). Between admission and discharge there was a significant decrease in the median weight (-2.5kg; 71.5 vs. 68.75kg; p-value<0.001), body mass index (-0.9kg/m(2); 24.8 vs. 24.4kg/m(2); p-value<0.001), and serum albumin levels (-0.2g/dL; 3.7 vs. 3.6g/dL; p-value=0.024). The survival time after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation correlated negatively with C-reactive protein at discharge (CC=-0.72; p-value<0.001) and positively with serum albumin levels (CC=0.56; p-value=0.004) and with high total protein level at discharge (CC=0.53; p-value=0.006). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients submitted to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have compromised nutritional status during the hospital stay for transplantation.","['Ferreira, Erika Elias', 'Guerra, Daiane Cristina', 'Baluz, Katia', 'de Resende Furtado, Wander', 'da Silva Bouzas, Luis Fernando']","['Ferreira EE', 'Guerra DC', 'Baluz K', 'de Resende Furtado W', 'da Silva Bouzas LF']","['Instituto Nacional de Cancer Jose Alencar Gomes da Silva (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer Jose Alencar Gomes da Silva (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

Herein, we describe a rare concurrence, B-ALL with MPN without the aforementioned genetic aberrations, in a 64-year-old male patient. The patient was initially diagnosed with B-ALL with normal karyotype and responded well to aggressive chemotherapy but had sustained leukocytosis and splenomegaly. The posttreatment restaging bone marrow was free of B-ALL but remained hypercellular with myeloid predominance. Using a single nucleotide polymorphism microarray study, we identified a copy neutral loss of heterozygosity at the terminus of 1p in the bone marrow samples taken at diagnosis and again at remission, 49% and 100%, respectively. Several additional genetic abnormalities were present in the initial marrow sample but not in the remission marrow samples. Retrospective molecular studies detected a MPL W515S homozygous mutation in both the initial and remission marrows for B-ALL, at 30-40% and 80% dosage effect, respectively. In summary, we present a case of concurrent B-ALL and MPN and demonstrate a stepwise cytogenetic and molecular approach to the final diagnosis.","['Tao, Jiangchuan', 'Zhang, Xiaohui', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'Bennett, John M', 'Cai, Li', 'Papenhausen, Peter', 'Moscinski, Lynn', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Tao J', 'Zhang X', 'Lancet J', 'Bennett JM', 'Cai L', 'Papenhausen P', 'Moscinski L', 'Zhang L']","['Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, H.

Most reports have focused on HM diagnosed after SLE, and have excluded concurrent and preceding diagnoses. Information on response to therapy is also limited. METHODS: We identified 13 296 cases of HM and 10 539 potential patients with SLE at our centre; 45 patients were confirmed to have HM and SLE. Our retrospective case series was based on these 45 patients. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients, 64% were diagnosed with HM >/=1 year after diagnosis with SLE, and 36% with HM before or concurrent with SLE. Of the 29 patients with HM after SLE, 13 had diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 6 indolent lymphoma, 4 leukaemia, 3 Hodgkin's disease, and 1 each Burkitt's lymphoma, T cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Eleven patients with DLBCL were treated with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisone (CHOP) or rituximab-CHOP; hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisone; only four achieved durable remission. Of the 16 patients diagnosed with HM before or concurrent with SLE, 9 were diagnosed with HM more than 2 years before SLE and tended to be in remission prior to SLE diagnosis. Seven patients were diagnosed with HM and SLE concurrently; in terms of their HM, six achieved remission or stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, DLBCL was the most common type of lymphoma in patients diagnosed with HM after SLE; these patients presented with advanced-stage disease and had poor outcomes.

We have previously determined that cells from APL patients show increased expression of genes regulated by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) compared to normal promyelocytes. HIFs regulate crucial aspects of solid tumor progression and are currently being implicated in leukemogenesis. METHODS: To investigate the contribution of hypoxia-related signaling in APL compared to other AML sub-types, we reverse engineered a transcriptional network from gene expression profiles of AML patients' samples, starting from a list of direct target genes of HIF-1. A HIF-1-dependent subnetwork of genes specifically dysregulated in APL was derived from the comparison between APL and other AMLs. RESULTS: Interestingly, this subnetwork shows a unique involvement of genes related to extracellular matrix interaction and cell migration, with decreased expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and increased expression of genes implicated in motility and invasion, thus unveiling the presence of characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We observed that the genes of this subnetwork, whose dysregulation shows a peculiar pattern across different AML sub-types, distinguish malignant from normal promyelocytes, thus ruling out dependence on a myeloid developmental stage. Also, expression of these genes is reversed upon treatment of APL-derived NB4 cells with all-trans retinoic acid and cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that pathways related to EMT-like processes can be implicated also in hematological malignancies besides solid tumors, and can identify specific AML sub-types.","['Percio, Stefano', 'Coltella, Nadia', 'Grisanti, Sara', 'Bernardi, Rosa', 'Pattini, Linda']","['Percio S', 'Coltella N', 'Grisanti S', 'Bernardi R', 'Pattini L']","['Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132 Milan, Italy ; Leukemia Unit, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 60, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132 Milan, Italy ; Leukemia Unit, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 60, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141201,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,PMC4249615,,,2014/12/03 06:00,2014/12/03 06:01,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13073-014-0084-4 [doi]', '84 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2014 Dec 1;6(12):84. doi: 10.1186/s13073-014-0084-4. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of cesarean delivery has also increased in this period and has been associated with the development of some of these diseases. METHODS: Mature children born by cesarean delivery were analyzed for risk of hospital contact for chronic immune diseases recorded in the Danish national registries in the 35-year period 1977-2012. Two million term children participated in the primary analysis. We studied childhood diseases with a suspected relation to a deviant immune-maturation and a debut at young age. The effect of cesarean delivery on childhood disease incidences were estimated by means of confounder-adjusted incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals obtained in Poisson regression analyses. RESULTS: Children delivered by cesarean delivery had significantly increased risk of asthma, systemic connective tissue disorders, juvenile arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune deficiencies, and leukemia. No associations were found between cesarean delivery and type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, or celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Cesarean delivery exemplifies a shared environmental risk factor in early life associating with several chronic immune diseases. Understanding commonalities in the underlying mechanisms behind chronic diseases may give novel insight into their origin and allow prevention.","['Sevelsted, Astrid', 'Stokholm, Jakob', 'Bonnelykke, Klaus', 'Bisgaard, Hans']","['Sevelsted A', 'Stokholm J', 'Bonnelykke K', 'Bisgaard H']","['Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen & Danish Pediatric Asthma Center, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; and bisgaard@copsac.com.', 'Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen & Danish Pediatric Asthma Center, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; and Department of Pediatrics, Naestved Hospital, Naestved, Denmark.', 'Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen & Danish Pediatric Asthma Center, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; and.', 'Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen & Danish Pediatric Asthma Center, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141201,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,['NOTNLM'],"['asthma', 'cesarean section', 'inflammatory disease', 'origins', 'prenatal', 'programming']",2014/12/03 06:00,2015/03/07 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2014-0596 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2014-0596 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2015 Jan;135(1):e92-8. doi: 10.1542/peds.2014-0596.

Preclinical studies demonstrate that activation of NK cells using interleukin-15 (IL-15) plus 4-1BBL upregulates activating receptor expression and augments killing capacity. In an effort to amplify the beneficial effects of NK cells post-HSCT, we conducted a first-in-human trial of adoptive transfer of donor-derived IL-15/4-1BBL-activated NK cells (aNK-DLI) following HLA-matched, T-cell-depleted (1-2 x 10(4) T cells/kg) nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in children and young adults with ultra-high-risk solid tumors. aNK-DLI were CD3(+)-depleted, CD56(+)-selected lymphocytes, cultured for 9 to 11 days with recombinant human IL-15 plus 4-1BBL(+)IL-15Ralpha(+) artificial antigen-presenting cells. aNK-DLI demonstrated potent killing capacity and displayed high levels of activating receptor expression. Five of 9 transplant recipients experienced acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following aNK-DLI, with grade 4 GVHD observed in 3 subjects. GVHD was more common in matched unrelated donor vs matched sibling donor recipients and was associated with higher donor CD3 chimerism. Given that the T-cell dose was below the threshold required for GVHD in this setting, we conclude that aNK-DLI contributed to the acute GVHD observed, likely by augmenting underlying T-cell alloreactivity. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01287104.","['Shah, Nirali N', 'Baird, Kristin', 'Delbrook, Cynthia P', 'Fleisher, Thomas A', 'Kohler, Mark E', 'Rampertaap, Shakuntala', 'Lemberg, Kimberly', 'Hurley, Carolyn K', 'Kleiner, David E', 'Merchant, Melinda S', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Sabatino, Marianna', 'Stroncek, David F', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Fry, Terry J', 'Mackall, Crystal L']","['Shah NN', 'Baird K', 'Delbrook CP', 'Fleisher TA', 'Kohler ME', 'Rampertaap S', 'Lemberg K', 'Hurley CK', 'Kleiner DE', 'Merchant MS', 'Pittaluga S', 'Sabatino M', 'Stroncek DF', 'Wayne AS', 'Zhang H', 'Fry TJ', 'Mackall CL']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC;', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA."", 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141201,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4311226,,,2014/12/03 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35294-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-07-592881 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jan 29;125(5):784-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-07-592881.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from seven GCT trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (United States) or the Children's Cancer and Leukemia Group (United Kingdom) between 1985 and 2009 were merged to create a data set of patients with stage II to IV disease treated with platinum-based therapy. A parametric cure model was used to evaluate the prognostic importance of age, tumor site, stage, histology, tumor markers, and treatment regimen and estimate the percentage of patients who achieved long-term disease-free (LTDF) survival in each subgroup of the final model. Validation of the model was conducted using the bootstrap method. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis of 519 patients with GCTs, stage IV disease (P = .001), age >/= 11 years (P < .001), and tumor site (P < .001) were significant predictors of worse LTDF survival. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >/= 10,000 ng/mL was associated with worse outcome, whereas pure yolk sac tumor (YST) was associated with better outcome, although neither met criteria for statistical significance. The analysis identified a group of patients age > 11 years with either stage III to IV extragonadal tumors or stage IV ovarian tumors with predicted LTDF survival < 70%. A bootstrap procedure showed retention of age, tumor site, and stage in > 94%, AFP in 12%, and YST in 27% of the replications. CONCLUSION: Clinical trial data from two large national pediatric clinical trial organizations have produced a new evidence-based risk stratification of malignant pediatric GCTs that identifies a poor-risk group warranting intensified therapy.","['Frazier, A Lindsay', 'Hale, Juliet P', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos', 'Dang, Ha', 'Olson, Thomas', 'Murray, Matthew J', 'Amatruda, James F', 'Thornton, Claire', 'Arul, G Suren', 'Billmire, Deborah', 'Shaikh, Furqan', 'Pashankar, Farzana', 'Stoneham, Sara', 'Krailo, Mark', 'Nicholson, James C']","['Frazier AL', 'Hale JP', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Dang H', 'Olson T', 'Murray MJ', 'Amatruda JF', 'Thornton C', 'Arul GS', 'Billmire D', 'Shaikh F', 'Pashankar F', 'Stoneham S', 'Krailo M', 'Nicholson JC']","[""A.

These proteins include the chromatin-modifying enzymes that ""write"" and ""erase"" histone posttranslational modifications (PTM), and those that ""read"" these marks through binding modules. In an effort to find a compound that could disrupt the protein-protein interactions between a PTM and reader, JQ1 has proven to be a first-in-class, drug-like inhibitor of the ""bromodomain and extraterminal domain"" epigenetic readers (BETs), which recognize histone lysine acetylation marks. JQ1 has facilitated the mechanistic study and therapeutic application in cancer of this kind of epigenetic inhibition. By using this chemical probe, we have discovered that the bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) have compelling activity in preclinical models of multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In particular, BETi down-regulates the MYC, IL-7R, and E2F transcriptional programs. We are continuously integrating the transcriptional consequences of BETi with changes in the epigenomic landscapes of cancer cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying response to BETi using chemical and genetic perturbations.","['Qi, Jun']",['Qi J'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141201,United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,101513680,PMC4292150,,,2014/12/03 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['6/12/a018663 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a018663 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2014 Dec 1;6(12):a018663. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a018663.,['Copyright (c) 2014 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],IM,"['Azepines/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Triazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']","['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified miR-638 as a novel regulator in myeloid differentiation and proliferation of leukemic cells. We found that miR-638 was developmentally up-regulated in cells of myeloid but not lymphoid lineage. Furthermore, significant miR-638 down-regulation was observed in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts, whereas miR-638 expression was dramatically up-regulated in primary AML blasts and leukemic cell lines undergoing forced myeloid differentiation. These observations suggest that miR-638 might play a role in myeloid differentiation, and its dysregulation may contribute to leukemogenesis. Indeed, ectopic expression of miR-638 promoted phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- or all-trans-retinoic acid-induced differentiation of leukemic cell lines and primary AML blasts, whereas miR-638 inhibition caused an opposite phenotype. Consistently, miR-638 overexpression induced G1 cell cycle arrest and reduced colony formation in soft agar. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) was found to be a target gene of miR-638. CDK2 inhibition phenotypically mimicked the overexpression of miR-638. Moreover, forced expression of CDK2 restored the proliferation and the colony-forming ability inhibited by miR-638. Our data suggest that miR-638 regulates proliferation and myeloid differentiation by targeting CDK2 and may serve as a novel target for leukemia therapy or marker for AML diagnosis and prognosis.","['Lin, Yi', 'Li, Dengju', 'Liang, Qing', 'Liu, Shangqing', 'Zuo, Xuelan', 'Li, Lin', 'Sun, Xuemei', 'Li, Wenxin', 'Guo, Mingxiong', 'Huang, Zan']","['Lin Y', 'Li D', 'Liang Q', 'Liu S', 'Zuo X', 'Li L', 'Sun X', 'Li W', 'Guo M', 'Huang Z']","['From the College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430072.', 'the Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Huazhong Technology University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430030.', 'the Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430071, and.', 'the Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430071, and.', 'the Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430071, and.', 'the Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210029.', 'the Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210029.', 'From the College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430072.', 'From the College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430072, guomx@whu.edu.cn.', 'From the College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, 430072, z-huang@whu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141201,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC4340423,['NOTNLM'],"['Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK)', 'Differentiation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia', 'MicroRNA (miRNA)']",2014/12/03 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)57835-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.599191 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Jan 16;290(3):1818-28. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.599191.

However, anti-allergic medicines available in the market have no effect on FA, and consequently effective drug therapies for FA are not yet available. We have already demonstrated that mucosal mast cells play an essential role in the development of FA in a murine model. Thus, we screened many constituents from medicinal herbs for the ability to inhibit rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 mast-like cell degranulation, and found that shikonin, a naphthoquinone dye from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect among them. Furthermore, shikonin extremely inhibited the IgE/antigen-induced and calcium ionophore-induced upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA expression in mucosal-type bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMCs). Global gene expression analysis confirmed by real-time PCR revealed that shikonin drastically inhibited the IgE/antigen-induced and calcium ionophore-induced upregulation of mRNA expression of the nuclear orphan receptor 4a family (Nr4a1, Nr4a2 and Nr4a3) in mBMMCs, and knockdown of Nr4a1 or Nr4a2 suppressed the IgE/antigen-induced upregulation of TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Computational docking simulation of a small molecule for a target protein is a useful technique to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of drugs. Therefore, the simulation revealed that the predicted binding sites of shikonin to immunophilins (cyclophilin A and FK506 binding protein (FKBP) 12) were almost the same as the binding sites of immunosuppressants (cyclosporin A and FK506) to immunophilins. Indeed, shikonin inhibited the calcineurin activity to a similar extent as cyclosporin A that markedly suppressed the IgE/antigen-enhanced mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and the Nr4a family in mBMMCs. These findings suggest that shikonin suppresses mucosal mast cell activation by reducing Nr4a family gene expression through the inhibition of calcineurin activity. Therefore, shikonin has therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic diseases as a new calcineurin inhibitor.","['Wang, Xiaoyu', 'Hayashi, Shusaku', 'Umezaki, Masahito', 'Yamamoto, Takeshi', 'Kageyama-Yahara, Natsuko', 'Kondo, Takashi', 'Kadowaki, Makoto']","['Wang X', 'Hayashi S', 'Umezaki M', 'Yamamoto T', 'Kageyama-Yahara N', 'Kondo T', 'Kadowaki M']","['Division of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Research Center for Ethnomedicine, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.

Transient inhibition of miR-21 resulted in increased apoptosis, PTEN upregulation and AKT dephosphorylation, whereas ectopic overexpression of miR-21 further conferred imatinib resistance. Furthermore, knockdown of PTEN protected the cells from imatinib-induced apoptosis achieved by inhibition of miR-21.

RESULTS: In the Netherlands, 745 patients had been registered between 2009 and 2012. An overall prevalence of 4.0 per 100,000 inhabitants was calculated. The most prevalent PID was 'predominantly antibody disorder (PAD)' (60.4%). In total, 118 transplantations were reported, mostly hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT). Almost 10% of the PID patients suffered from a malignancy, in particular 'lymphoma' and 'skin cancer'. Compared to the general Dutch population, the relative risk of developing any malignancy was 2.3-fold increased, with a >10-fold increase for some solid tumors (thymus, endocrine organs) and hematological disease (lymphoma, leukemia), varying per disease category. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate and characteristics of PID in the Netherlands are similar to those in other European countries. Compared to the general population, PID patients carry an increased risk to develop a malignancy.","['Jonkman-Berk, B M', 'van den Berg, J M', 'Ten Berge, I J M', 'Bredius, R G M', 'Driessen, G J', 'Dalm, V A S H', 'van Dissel, J T', 'van Deuren, M', 'Ellerbroek, P M', 'van der Flier, M', 'van Hagen, P M', 'van Montfrans, J M', 'Rutgers, A', 'Scholvinck, E H', 'de Vries, E', 'van Beem, R T', 'Kuijpers, T W']","['Jonkman-Berk BM', 'van den Berg JM', 'Ten Berge IJ', 'Bredius RG', 'Driessen GJ', 'Dalm VA', 'van Dissel JT', 'van Deuren M', 'Ellerbroek PM', 'van der Flier M', 'van Hagen PM', 'van Montfrans JM', 'Rutgers A', 'Scholvinck EH', 'de Vries E', 'van Beem RT', 'Kuijpers TW']","[""Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center (AMC), Dept. of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Amsterdam (UvA), Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

PKA phosphorylates VASP at serine 157, regulating VASP cellular functions. VASP interacts with ABL and is a substrate of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. The presence of BCR-ABL protein drives oncogenesis in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) due to a constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase activity. However, the function of VASP and Zyxin in BCR-ABL pathway and the role of VASP in CML cells remain unknown. In vitro experiments using K562 cells showed the involvement of VASP in BCR-ABL signaling. VASP and Zyxin inhibition decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL2 and BCL-XL. Imatinib induced an increase in phosphorylation at Ser157 of VASP and decreased VASP and BCR-ABL interaction. VASP did not interact with Zyxin in K562 cells; however, after Imatinib treatment, this interaction was restored. Corroborating our data, we demonstrated the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in VASP in the bone marrow of CML patients, in contrast to healthy donors. Phosphorylation of VASP on Ser157 was restored in Imatinib responsive patients though not in the resistant patients. Therefore, we herein identified a possible role of VASP in CML pathogenesis, through the regulation of BCR-ABL effector proteins or the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in VASP.","['Bernusso, Vanessa A', 'Machado-Neto, Joao A', 'Pericole, Fernando V', 'Vieira, Karla P', 'Duarte, Adriana S S', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Hansen, Marc D', 'Olalla Saad, Sara T', 'Barcellos, Karin S A']","['Bernusso VA', 'Machado-Neto JA', 'Pericole FV', 'Vieira KP', 'Duarte AS', 'Traina F', 'Hansen MD', 'Olalla Saad ST', 'Barcellos KS']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Moreover, c-Cbl mutations are frequently found in patients with myeloid neoplasm. Therefore, c-Cbl is known as a tumor suppressor. alphaPix is expressed only in highly proliferative and mobile cells, including immune cells, and up-regulated in certain invasive tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Here, we showed that c-Cbl serves as an ubiquitin E3 ligase for proteasome-mediated degradation of alphaPix, but not betaPix. Remarkably, the rat C6 and human A172 glioma cells were unable to express c-Cbl, which leads to a dramatic accumulation of alphaPix. Depletion of alphaPix by shRNA markedly reduced the ability of the glioma cells to migrate and invade, whereas complementation of shRNA-insensitive alphaPix promoted it. These results indicate that c-Cbl negatively regulates alphaPix-mediated cell migration and invasion and the lack of c-Cbl in the C6 and A172 glioma cells is responsible for their malignant behavior.","['Seong, Min Woo', 'Park, Ji Ho', 'Yoo, Hee Min', 'Yang, Seung Wook', 'Oh, Kyu Hee', 'Ka, Seung Hyeun', 'Park, Dong Eun', 'Lee, Soon-Tae', 'Chung, Chin Ha']","['Seong MW', 'Park JH', 'Yoo HM', 'Yang SW', 'Oh KH', 'Ka SH', 'Park DE', 'Lee ST', 'Chung CH']","['School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 110-744, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Institute for Protein Metabolism, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.

The current study aimed to analyze the molecular composition of childhood ALL biopsies and patient-derived xenografts with particular emphasis on mechanisms associated with acquired chemoresistance. Genomic DNA from seven primary pediatric ALL patient samples, 29 serially passaged xenografts, and six in vivo selected chemoresistant xenografts were analyzed with 250K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Copy-number analysis of non-drug-selected xenografts confirmed a highly variable molecular pattern of variegated subclones. Whereas primary patient samples from initial diagnosis displayed a mean of 5.7 copy-number alterations per sample, serially passaged xenografts contained a mean of 8.2 and chemoresistant xenografts a mean of 10.5 copy-number alterations per sample, respectively. Resistance to cytarabine was explained by a new homozygous deletion of the DCK gene, whereas methotrexate resistance was associated with monoallelic deletion of FPGS and mutation of the remaining allele.

Three stabilizing mutations (i.e., E286R, E302K, and L435R) were identified (Yasukawa et al., 2010). Now, we studied the mechanism by which those mutations increase the thermal stability of the RT. The three single-mutants (E286R, E302K, and L435R), an RNase H-deficient MMLV RT (carrying the RNase H-inactivating mutation D524A), a quadruple mutant (E286R/E302K/L435R/D524A, designated as MM4) and the wild-type enzyme (WT) were produced in Escherichia coli. All RTs exhibited similar dissociation constants (Kd) for heteropolymeric DNA/DNA (2.9-6.5 nM) and RNA/DNA complexes (1.2-2.9 nM).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to further assess the relationship between MTHFR C677 > T polymorphisms and pediatric ALL for Chinese children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies about the MTHFR C677 > T polymorphisms and pediatric ALL risk were searched in the Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Wanfang and CNIK databases. The genotype of the case and control group were extracted and pooled by meta-analysis. The association between ALL risk and C677 > T polymorphisms was demonstrated by odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Twelve articles were included in this study with 1803 ALL cases and 4146 controls. In recessive genetic model (TT vs. CC + CT), the OR was 0.37 (95%CI: 0.31-0.43); in dominant genetic model (TT + CT vs. CC) the OR was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.82-1.06); and in the homozygous model the OR was 0.84 (95%CI: 0.69-1.03). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that Asian children with TT genotype of MTHFR gene may have less risk of developing ALL.","['Lin, Shiguang', 'Liu, Qin', 'Zeng, Xiaoming']","['Lin S', 'Liu Q', 'Zeng X']","[""Department of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Fuzhou, Fuzhou 350005, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,,,,2014/12/03 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2014_10_7_210_145877 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.145877 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2014 Nov;10 Suppl:C210-4. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.145877.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asia', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors']","['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many patients exhibit resistance to IM in the clinic. Recent studies have indicated that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase (HDAC), plays an important role in leukemogenesis. In addition, some HDAC inhibitors are being tested to determine their anti-cancer activities in clinical trials. Divalproex sodium (DVPX), a first-line treatment for epilepsy, is also a HDAC inhibitor. However, it is unclear whether the anti-leukemic effects of IM in combination with DVPX on CML cells are related to SIRT1. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IM in combination with DVPX on cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in CML cells and to explore the underlying mechanisms. It was found that DVPX enhanced IM-induced cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in K562-S and K562-G cells. Surprisingly, the level of p-Bcr-Abl was similar in K562-S and K562-G cells. Moreover, IM combined with DVPX had no effects on the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and its downstream target STAT5. Further study revealed that SIRT1 expression was higher in K562-G cells compared with K562-S cells. DVPX enhanced the inhibitory effect of IM on SIRT1 expression in K562-S and K562-G cells. Furthermore, knockdown of SIRT1 promoted apoptosis of K562-G cells treated with IM and DVPX. These results indicate that DVPX may increase the sensitivity of CML cells to IM and reverse IM resistance by regulating SIRT1 expression.","['Wang, Weirong', 'Zhang, Jianfeng', 'Li, Yanxiang', 'Yang, Xiaofeng', 'He, Yanhao', 'Li, Tingting', 'Ren, Feng', 'Zhang, Jiye', 'Lin, Rong']","['Wang W', 'Zhang J', 'Li Y', 'Yang X', 'He Y', 'Li T', 'Ren F', 'Zhang J', 'Lin R']","[""Research Institute of Atherosclerotic Disease, Xi'an Jiaotong University Cardiovascular Research Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China; Laboratory Animal Center, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Eighth Hospital of Xi'an City, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China.

We examined with a female rat model whether and how dienogest, a fourth-generation progestin, modulates reduced fertility following exposure to gonadotoxic chemotherapy. Female rats were administered cyclophosphamide with or without GnRH agonist and different concentrations of dienogest for 20 days. Animals were sacrificed on Day 29, and the numbers of follicle at primordial, preantral and antral stage in the ovaries were counted histologically. Rats treated with sterile saline solution (as control), cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide plus GnRH agonist, and cyclophosphamide plus dienogest were also mated with male rats to evaluate their fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Cyclophosphamide significantly reduced the number of primordial follicles, whereas dienogest suppressed depletion of primordial follicle pool induced by chemotherapy. Although the rats exposed to cyclophosphamide alone failed to deliver live births, co-treatment with dienogest improved the pregnancy outcomes of treated rats. The protective effect of dienogest on chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage and reduced fertility was comparable to that of GnRH agonist. The present results suggest that the co-administration of dienogest and chemotherapy may be a useful strategy in preserving ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women facing gonadotoxic chemotherapy.","['Tsuyoshi, Hideaki', 'Orisaka, Makoto', 'Fukuda, Shin', 'Hattori, Katsushige', 'Tsang, Benjamin K', 'Yoshida, Yoshio']","['Tsuyoshi H', 'Orisaka M', 'Fukuda S', 'Hattori K', 'Tsang BK', 'Yoshida Y']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.

In this phase I/II trial, 30 patients received 100mg/day (n=5) or 150mg/day (n=25) of Erlotinib orally after primary or secondary resistance to AZA treatment. Eighteen MDS and 12 AML patients were treated. This outpatient treatment was well tolerated with limited grade III-IV extra hematological toxicities (skin (n=1), and diarrhea (n=3). Response was observed in 6 patients (20%) including 1 complete remission (CR), 1 marrow CR and 4 hematological improvement (2 erythroid and 2 on platelets). Median duration of response was 5 months. Erlotinib appears to induce a significant number of responses in higher risk MDS/AML having failed AZA treatment. Given the good safety profile of Erlotinib, its combination with other drugs could be tested in the future in MDS and AML.","['Thepot, Sylvain', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Seegers, Valerie', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Jourdan, Eric', 'Chermat, Fatiha', 'Sebert, Marie', 'Kroemer, Guido', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Ades, Lionel']","['Thepot S', 'Boehrer S', 'Seegers V', 'Prebet T', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Wattel E', 'Delaunay J', 'Raffoux E', 'Hunault M', 'Jourdan E', 'Chermat F', 'Sebert M', 'Kroemer G', 'Fenaux P', 'Ades L']","['Hematologie - Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire, Angers, France.', 'Hematologie, Hopital Avicenne, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Universite Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', ""Service d'Informatique Medicale, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire, Angers France."", 'Hematologie, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Lyon Sud, Lyon, France.', 'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Hotel Dieu, Nantes, France.', 'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital Saint Louis, APHP, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie - Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire, Angers, France.', 'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nimes, France.', 'Hematologie Seniors, Hopital Saint Louis, APHP, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie Seniors, Hopital Saint Louis, APHP, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Laboratoire Apoptose, Cancer et Immunite, INSERM U1138, Cordeliers Research Center, Universite Paris 5, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie Seniors, Hopital Saint Louis, APHP, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie Seniors, Hopital Saint Louis, APHP, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.

Many patients of sarcoma have poor response to chemotherapy and an increased risk for local recurrence. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is used to treat certain types of leukemia. Recently, data have revealed that ATO induces sarcoma cell death in several types of solid tumor cell lines. In the present study, we investigated whether ATO induces cancer cell death and elucidated the underlying anti-cancer mechanisms. Our results showed that ATO caused concentration- and time-dependent cell death in human osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cells. The types of cell death that were induced by ATO were primarily autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, ATO activated p38, JNK and AMPK and inhibited the Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Specifically, we found that ATO induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and suppressed proteasome activation in two types of sarcoma cell lines. However, the level of proteasome inhibition in osteosarcoma cells was lower than in fibrosarcoma cells. Thus, we used combined treatment with ATO and a proteasome inhibitor to examine the antitumor activity in fibrosarcoma cells. The data indicated showed that the combination treatment of ATO and MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity. In a fibrosarcoma xenograft mouse model, the combined treatment significantly reduced tumor progression. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that combined treatment induced autophagy and apoptosis. In summary, our results suggest a potential clinical application of ATO in sarcoma therapy and that combined treatment with a proteasome inhibitor can increase the therapeutic efficacy.","['Chiu, Hui-Wen', 'Tseng, Yin-Chiu', 'Hsu, Yung-Ho', 'Lin, Yuh-Feng', 'Foo, Ning-Ping', 'Guo, How-Ran', 'Wang, Ying-Jan']","['Chiu HW', 'Tseng YC', 'Hsu YH', 'Lin YF', 'Foo NP', 'Guo HR', 'Wang YJ']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Emergency Medicine, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Liouying, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Emergency Medicine, China Medical University-An Nan Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.

Here, we demonstrated that prostratin, a potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator, inhibited the growth of myeloid leukemia cells by a predominant G1 arrest with variable induction of apoptosis. Conversely, prostratin induced significant differentiation of AML cell lines and primary AML blasts as evidenced by morphology and immunophenotyping. The effects of prostratin were PKC dependent, and activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1/2 by PKC was required for prostratin-induced cell differentiation. Consequently, prostratin reprogrammed transcriptional factor expression, and ectopic expression of c-Myc in HL-60 cells significantly eliminated prostratin-mediated cellular differentiation and cell cycle arrest, indicating an essential role for c-Myc suppression in the differentiation-inducing effects of prostratin. Finally, prostratin was able to potentiate cellular differentiation induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as Ara-C.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was used to measure the expression of MSI2 gene in 181 de novo AML patients. Correlation between the expression level and clinical features of such patients was explored. RESULTS: Transcript of the MSI2 gene was detected in 181 AML patients, with the median expression level being 2.341 (0.1124-58.8566). By contrast, CD34+ cells from 10 healthy controls had a much lower expression level (P=0.012), and the expression level of MSI2 in 24 patients with complete remission was significant lower than de novo patients (P=0.021). Based on the median expression level, such patients were divided into low expression group and high expression group. Patients from the high expression group had significantly higher rate of high white blood cell count (78% vs. 63%, P=0.034). Compared with MSI2-low group, FLT3-ITD mutation were much more common in MSI2-high group (28% vs. 7%, P=0.002). The expression level of MSI2 in aberrant karyotypes was much higher than that in favorable karyotypes (the median expression level was 2.7726 and 2.0733, P=0.035). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the overall survival in high expression group of MSI2 was lower than the low expression group, with the median survival time being 28 months and 12 months, respectively (P=0.045). CONCLUSION: De novo AML patients have a higher level of MSI2 gene expression. And the latter is much more common in those with high white blood cell count and aberrant karyotypes, and has a positive correlation with FLT3-ITD mutation. High expression of MSI2 gene may be a predictor for poorer prognosis among AML patients.","['Lu, Ying', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Mu, Qitian', 'Pei, Renzhi', 'Wang, Qiong', 'Chen, Zhimei', 'Jin, Jie']","['Lu Y', 'Yu M', 'Mu Q', 'Pei R', 'Wang Q', 'Chen Z', 'Jin J']","[""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Yinzhou, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315040 P.

Among the four isoforms (Mef2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D), Mef2C was also found to play important roles in hematopoiesis. At myeloid progenitor level, Mef2C expression favors monocytic differentiation. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that ERK5 was activated in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D)-induced monocytic differentiation in AML cells and ERK5 activation was accompanied by increased Mef2C phosphorylation. We therefore examined the role of Mef2C in 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation in AML cell lines (HL60, U937 and THP1) and found that knockdown of Mef2C with small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreases the expression of the monocytic marker, CD14, without affecting the expression of the general myeloid marker, CD11b. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) beta, which can bind to CD14 promoter and increase its transcription, has been shown to be the downstream effector of 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation in AML cells. When Mef2C was knocked down, expression of C/EBPbeta was reduced at both mRNA and protein levels. The protein expression levels of cell cycle regulators, p27(Kip1) and cyclin D1, were not affected by Mef2C knockdown, nor the monopoiesis related transcription factor, ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2). Thus, we conclude that 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation, and CD14 expression in particular, are mediated through activation of ERK5-Mef2C-C/EBPbeta signaling pathway, and that Mef2C does not seem to modulate cell cycle progression.","['Zheng, Ruifang', 'Wang, Xuening', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Zheng R', 'Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['UH Cancer Center, Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School, 205 South Orange Ave., Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave., Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'UH Cancer Center, Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School, 205 South Orange Ave., Newark, NJ 07103, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave., Newark, NJ 07103, USA.

The major components of Scutellariae Radix are baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside and wogonin. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that Scutellaria has immunomodulatory effects and possesses compelling anticancer potential. Treatment of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) with Scutellaria extract (SBE) enriched in baicalin, reduced viability of PBLs obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). SBE had no impact on the survival of healthy, control leukocytes. The immune system modulation by SBE resulted in increased production of IFNgamma in PBLs, and reduced TNFalpha and IL-10 production in bone marrow cells (BMC), in ALL patients. SBE stimulated the nonspecific antiviral immunity, assessed by resistance of PBLs and BMC to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. SBE showed pro-apoptotic activity in NALM-6 cell line (B-type human leukemia). The number of cells expressing annexin V increased from 6% in control cultures to 29% and 52% after treatment with 100 mug/ml and 200 mug/ml respectively. Increased percentage of apoptotic cells was observed when cells were treated with corresponding concentration of baicalin. SBE enhanced apoptosis of PBLs in BMC of leukemic children. The percentage of PBLs that underwent apoptosis and mean annexin V expression increased from 11% in the control to 17% and 24% for the doses of 100 mug/ml and 200 mug/ml respectively.

We demonstrate here that ATL cells cultured on a layer of epithelial-like feeder cells form anchorage-dependent multicellular aggregates (Ad-MCAs) and that a fraction of MCA-forming ATL cells acquire CD44 high cancer stem cell-like phenotypes. ATL cells forming Ad-MCAs displayed extracellular microvesicles with enhanced expression of CD44v9 at cell synapses, augmented expression of multidrug resistance protein 1, and increased NF-kappaB activity. Blockade of the NF-kappaB pathway dramatically reduced Ad-MCA formation by ATL cells and the emergence of CD44 high ATL cells, but left a considerable number of ATL cells adhering to the feeder layer. Disruption of vimentin cytoskeleton by treatment with withaferin A, a natural steroidal lactone, suppressed not only the adhesion of ATL cells to the feeder layer but also subsequent Ad-MCA formation by ATL cells, suggesting the involvement of vimentin in anchoring ATL cells to the feeder layer. Ad-MCA formation by ATL cells on a layer of epithelial-like feeder cells may mimic critical events that occur in metastatic colonization.","['Miyatake, Yukiko', 'Sheehy, Noreen', 'Ikeshita, Shunji', 'Hall, William W', 'Kasahara, Masanori']","['Miyatake Y', 'Sheehy N', 'Ikeshita S', 'Hall WW', 'Kasahara M']","['Department of Pathology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan; Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland.

The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is up-regulated in many solid tumors; therefore, it may be a target for tumor therapy. Interestingly, IGF-1R is modified by SUMOylation, a type of reversible post-translational modification. In this study, we found that IGF-1R was increased in both cell lines and clinical samples of AML and was modified by SUMO-1. Furthermore, IGF-1, ligand of IGF-1R, induced the up-regulation of IGF-1R and increased the proliferation of leukemia cell line. After mutation of Lys(1025) and Lys(1100) in IGF-1R, the evolutionarily conserved lysine residues were identified as the SUMOylation sites of IGF-1R, because the SUMOylation of IGF-1R in these mutants was significantly inhibited. Furthermore, the cell proliferation mediated by IGF-1 was also reduced. After inhibition of UBC9, the activating enzyme of SUMOylation, co-expression of IGF-1R and SUMO-1 was down-regulated, and cell proliferation was also inhibited. However, cell apoptosis was not significantly affected. These results suggest that IGF-1R and its SUMOylation may be a new therapeutic target for strategy of AML.","['Zhang, Jian', 'Huang, Fang-Fang', 'Wu, Deng-Shu', 'Li, Wen-Jin', 'Zhan, Hui-En', 'Peng, Min-Yuan', 'Fang, Peng', 'Cao, Peng-Fei', 'Zhang, Meng-Meng', 'Zeng, Hui', 'Chen, Fang-Ping']","['Zhang J', 'Huang FF', 'Wu DS', 'Li WJ', 'Zhan HE', 'Peng MY', 'Fang P', 'Cao PF', 'Zhang MM', 'Zeng H', 'Chen FP']","['Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhong-Shan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiang-Ya Road, Changsha 410008, China.

In continuation of our previous work on 2,4,6-trisubstituted 1,3,5-triazines as potent CB2 agonists, we synthesized an additional series of more polar analogues (1-10), which were found to possess high CB2R agonist activity with enhanced water solubility. The most potent compound in the series was N-(adamantan-1-yl)-4-ethoxy-6-(4-(2-fluoroethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-a mine (9) with EC50 value of 0.60nM. To further evaluate the biological effects of the compounds, the selected compounds were tested in vitro against four different cell lines. A human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the compounds whereas an androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (LNCaP), a Jurkat leukemia cell line and a C8161 melanoma cell line were used to assess the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. The most interesting results were obtained for N-(adamantan-1-yl)-4-ethoxy-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (6), which induced cell viability decrease in prostate and leukemia cell lines, and diminished proliferation of C8161 melanoma cells. The results could be reversed in leukemia cells with the selective CB2R antagonist AM630, whereas in prostate cells the AM630 induced a significant cell viability decrease with a mechanism probably unlinked to CB2 cannabinoid receptor. The antiproliferative effect of 6 on the melanoma cells seemed not to be mediated via the CB1R or CB2R. No cytotoxicity was detected against ARPE-19 cell line at concentrations of 1 and 10muM for compound 6. However, at 30muM concentration the compound 6 decreased the cell viability. Finally, in order to estimate in vivo behavior of these compounds, (18)F labeled PET ligand, N-cyclopentyl-4-ethoxy-6-(4-(2-fluoro-18-ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-am ine ([(18)F]5), was synthesized and its biodistribution was determined in healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats. As a result, the tracer showed a rapid (<15min) elimination in urine accompanied by a slower excretion via the hepatobiliary route. In conclusion, we further demonstrated that 1,3,5-triazine scaffold serves as a suitable template for the design of highly potent CB2R agonists with reasonable water solubility properties. The compounds may be useful when studying the role of the endocannabinoid system in different diseases. The triazine scaffold is also a promising candidate for the development of new CB2R PET ligands.","['Yrjola, Sari', 'Sarparanta, Mirkka', 'Airaksinen, Anu J', 'Hytti, Maria', 'Kauppinen, Anu', 'Pasonen-Seppanen, Sanna', 'Adinolfi, Barbara', 'Nieri, Paola', 'Manera, Clementina', 'Keinanen, Outi', 'Poso, Antti', 'Nevalainen, Tapio J', 'Parkkari, Teija']","['Yrjola S', 'Sarparanta M', 'Airaksinen AJ', 'Hytti M', 'Kauppinen A', 'Pasonen-Seppanen S', 'Adinolfi B', 'Nieri P', 'Manera C', 'Keinanen O', 'Poso A', 'Nevalainen TJ', 'Parkkari T']","['School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, PO Box 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.

Although progress has been made regarding chemotherapeutic agents, new therapies that combine increased selectivity and efficacy with low resistance are still needed. In the search for new anticancer agents, therapies based on biologically active peptides, in particular, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have attracted attention for their decreased resistance development and low cytotoxicity. Many AMPs have proved to be tumoricidal agents against human cancer cells, but their mode of action is still controversial. The existence of common properties shared by the membranes of bacteria and tumor cells points to similar lipid-targeting mechanisms in both cases. On the other hand, anticancer peptides (ACPs) also induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis. Human neutrophil peptide-1 (HNP-1) is an endogenous AMP that has been implicated in different cellular phenomena such as tumor proliferation. The presence of HNP-1 in the serum/plasma of oncologic patients turns this peptide into a potential tumor biomarker. The present work reveals the different effects of HNP-1 on the biophysical and nanomechanical properties of solid and hematological tumor cells. Studies on cellular morphology, cellular stiffness, and membrane ultrastructure and charge using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and zeta potential measurements show a preferential binding of HNP-1 to solid tumor cells from human prostate adenocarcinoma when compared to human leukemia cells. AFM also reveals induction of apoptosis with cellular membrane defects at very low peptide concentrations. Understanding ACPs mode(s) of action will certainly open innovative pathways for drug development in cancer treatment.","['Gaspar, Diana', 'Freire, Joao M', 'Pacheco, Teresa R', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Castanho, Miguel A R B']","['Gaspar D', 'Freire JM', 'Pacheco TR', 'Barata JT', 'Castanho MA']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

The exact target and mechanism of CAI were not clearly understood yet. In the present study, we demonstrate that CAI is a non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, which provides comprehensive inhibitions of both adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate specific PDE (cAMP-PDE) and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate specific PDE (cGMP-PDE) isolated from rat brain, mouse pulmonary tissue, primary mouse peritoneal macrophages, RAW264.7 cells, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells and lymphocytic leukemia cells (L1210) with moderate potencies (IC50 approximately 0.5-30muM). The comprehensive elimination of PDE activities in living LLC cells by CAI results in accumulation of intracellular cAMP and cGMP, which can be visualized by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cyclic nucleotide sensors. The stimulation by 30muM CAI yielded ~1.5-fold greater cGMP responses compared with 10muM sildenafil citrate, whereas the influence of 30muM CAI on cAMP levels was similar as that of 100muM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). The non-selective inhibitory effect of CAI on cAMP-PDE and cGMP-PDE increases the likelihood for CAI to affect the balance between the levels of intracellular cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, then a variety of cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell functions and even related disease processes. When examining the widely proven anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities of CAI, it is important to affirm its comprehensive inhibitory effect on PDEs, which makes it superior to some selective PDE inhibitors in a way.","['Guo, Lei', 'Luo, Lifeng', 'Ju, Rui', 'Chen, Chen', 'Zhu, Lei', 'Li, Juan', 'Yu, Xiaoli', 'Ye, Caiying', 'Zhang, Dechang']","['Guo L', 'Luo L', 'Ju R', 'Chen C', 'Zhu L', 'Li J', 'Yu X', 'Ye C', 'Zhang D']","['Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 5, Dongdan Santiao, Beijing 100005, China.

The aim of this study was to learn how metal-induced oxidative stress triggers cell proliferation, a process of great significance for cancer. NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity and cell proliferation were measured as endpoints in both NOX-deficient and NOX-proficient cells. The X chromosome linked CGD (X-CGD) human promyelocytic leukemia PLB-985 cells lacking gp91phox and the X-CGD cells re-transfected with gp91phox (X-CGD-gp91(phox)) were used together with immortalized human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). The cells were exposed to different concentrations of the metals alone or together with the NOX inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). We found that the studied metals increased NOX activity. They stimulated cell proliferation in HaCaT and X-CGD-gp91(phox) cells at concentrations below 1muM but not in the X-CGD cells that lack functional NOX. Addition of DPI attenuated the metal-induced cell proliferation. At concentrations above 1muM these metals inhibited cell proliferation. Based on these findings, we propose that many environmental pollutants, including metals and also endogenous NOX-activators such as oxidants and growth factors, interfere with cell growth kinetics by increasing the levels of the diffusible molecule H2O2. Here, we provide evidence that NOXs is central to the mechanism of metal-mediated reactive oxygen species production and stimulation of cell proliferation.","['Mohammadi-Bardbori, Afshin', 'Rannug, Agneta']","['Mohammadi-Bardbori A', 'Rannug A']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Fars 71345-1583, Iran.', 'Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.

In the present study, we investigated the differential cytotoxic effects of H. niger on human tumour and healthy cells of the human immune system in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Protoanemonin and saponins, as significant constituents of H. niger extracts, were quantified in five individual batches using validated HPLC methods. Further, the impact of H. niger on proliferation capacity (MTT assay) as well as on apoptosis and necrosis induction in a panel of tumour cell lines and human lymphocytes (combined annexin V and propidium iodide staining) was monitored. In addition, NK cell function (degranulation-CD107a assay and IFN-gamma secretion) was also investigated since these immunocompetent cells are important for the control of malignancies within the human body. RESULTS: Extracts of H. niger induced proliferation inhibition not only of lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (MOLT4; IC50: 171 microg/mL) but also of myosarcoma (SK-UT-1b; IC50: 304 microg/mL) and melanoma cells (HT-144; IC50: 569 microg/mL) due to the induction of apoptosis. Purified T cells or NK cells were significantly affected through the presence of high H. niger concentrations while bulk lymphocytes were not affected. NK cells' anti-tumour functions expressed by degranulation capacity as well as IFN-y production were unaffected by the presence of the H. niger extract. Since protoanemonin and saponins have been reported in the literature to exert cytotoxic effects, their content was also determined. CONCLUSIONS: H. niger extracts exhibit differential cytotoxicity towards tumour cell lines and healthy human T- and NK-cells.","['Schink, Michael', 'Garcia-Kaufer, Manuel', 'Bertrams, Julia', 'Duckstein, Sarina M', 'Muller, Margit B', 'Huber, Roman', 'Stintzing, Florian C', 'Grundemann, Carsten']","['Schink M', 'Garcia-Kaufer M', 'Bertrams J', 'Duckstein SM', 'Muller MB', 'Huber R', 'Stintzing FC', 'Grundemann C']","['Helixor Heilmittel GmbH & Co.

Here we explore the role of autophagy, expression of BNIP3, and mitochondrial mass, in determining whether ATO and MG132 interaction can be shifted from antagonism to synergism in Raji cells. Treatment with ATO+MG132 increased the percentage of cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in U937 cells, but had no effect in Raji cells. Mitochondria were found in cytoplasmic marginal location in U937 cells but at perinuclear location in Raji cells. ATO+MG132 increased mitochondrial mass in U937 cells but decreased it in Raji cells, while autophagy was increased in both cell lines. BNIP3 was expressed in U937 cells at cytoplasmic marginal locations and was hardly detected in Raji cells. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) increased expression of BNIP3 in Raji cells at perinuclear locations. However antagonism between ATO and MG132 was increased in the presence of low doses of VPA. Addition of vincristine (VCR) blocked autophagy, while VPA+VCR treatment of Raji cells at sub-cytotoxic doses caused BNIP3 and mitochondria to redistribute to cytoplasmic peripheral location and increased mitochondrial mass. ATO+MG132 in the presence of subcytotoxic doses of VPA+VCR caused collapse of MMP in Raji cells, while interaction between ATO and MG132 shifted from antagonism to synergism. We conclude that synergism between ATO and MG132 was attained in Raji cells by disruption of the perinuclear mitochondrial cluster, blockage of selective autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy) by VCR, increased mitochondrial mass, and upregulation of BNIP3 by VPA.","['Cavaliere, Victoria', 'Lombardo, Tomas', 'Costantino, Susana N', 'Kornblihtt, Laura', 'Alvarez, Elida M', 'Blanco, Guillermo A']","['Cavaliere V', 'Lombardo T', 'Costantino SN', 'Kornblihtt L', 'Alvarez EM', 'Blanco GA']","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia Tumoral (LIT), IDEHU-CONICET, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, UBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Immunotoxicologia (LaITo), IDEHU-CONICET, Hospital de Clinicas, Jose de San Martin, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Tumoral (LIT), IDEHU-CONICET, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, UBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital de Clinicas, Jose de San Martin (UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Tumoral (LIT), IDEHU-CONICET, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, UBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Immunotoxicologia (LaITo), IDEHU-CONICET, Hospital de Clinicas, Jose de San Martin, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Purified CD41(hi) LSK cells showed exceedingly strong and prolonged myelo-erythroid-restricted reconstitution, and primed myelo-erythroid gene expression with a more primitive molecular signature as compared to the original common myeloid progenitor (CMP). The CD41(hi) LSK cells more strongly contributed to emergent and malignant myelopoiesis than LMPPs, and produced the original CMP by downregulating Sca-1 and CD41, suggesting that they are the earliest CMPs.

Additionally, NR4A1 and NR4A3 (Nor-1) are described as tumor suppressors in leukemia. The dysregulation and functions of the NR4A members are due to many factors, including transcriptional regulation, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications. These various levels of intracellular regulation result from the signaling cross-talk of the NR4A members with various signaling pathways, many of which are relevant to cancer and likely explain the family members' functions in oncogenesis and tumor suppression.

In myeloid leukemia cells, CaMKII, activated by the bcr-abl oncogene, promotes cell proliferation. Inhibition of CaMKII activity restricts cell proliferation, and correlates with growth arrest and differentiation. The mechanism by which the inhibition of CaMKII results in growth arrest and differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells is still unknown. We report that inhibition of CaMKII activity results in an upregulation of CaMKIV mRNA and protein in leukemia cell lines. Conversely, expression of CaMKIV inhibits autophosphorylation and activation of CaMKII, and elicits G0/G1cell cycle arrest,impairing cell proliferation. Furthermore, U937 cells expressing CaMKIV show elevated levels of Cdk inhibitors p27(kip1) and p16(ink4a) and reduced levels of cyclins A, B1 and D1. These findings were also confirmed in the K562 leukemic cell line. The relationship between CaMKII and CaMKIV is also observed in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, and it correlates with their immunophenotypic profile. Indeed, immature MO/M1 AML showed increased CaMKIV expression and decreased pCaMKII, whereas highly differentiated M4/M5 AML showed decreased CaMKIV expression and increased pCaMKII levels. Our data reveal a novel cross-talk between CaMKII and CaMKIV and suggest that CaMKII suppresses the expression of CaMKIV to promote leukemia cell proliferation.","['Monaco, Sara', 'Rusciano, Maria Rosaria', 'Maione, Angela S', 'Soprano, Maria', 'Gomathinayagam, Rohini', 'Todd, Lance R', 'Campiglia, Pietro', 'Salzano, Salvatore', 'Pastore, Lucio', 'Leggiero, Eleonora', 'Wilkerson, Donald C', 'Rocco, Monia', 'Selleri, Carmine', 'Iaccarino, Guido', 'Sankar, Uma', 'Illario, Maddalena']","['Monaco S', 'Rusciano MR', 'Maione AS', 'Soprano M', 'Gomathinayagam R', 'Todd LR', 'Campiglia P', 'Salzano S', 'Pastore L', 'Leggiero E', 'Wilkerson DC', 'Rocco M', 'Selleri C', 'Iaccarino G', 'Sankar U', 'Illario M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Traslazionali, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Traslazionali, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Traslazionali, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Traslazionali, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita di Salerno, Fisciano, Salerno,Italy.', 'Instituto di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale, CNR, Naples, Italy.', 'CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate, Italy; Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biotecnologie Mediche, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate, Italy.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Experimental Pharmacology Unit, Department of Research, National Cancer Institute ""Fondazione G.

In this study, we explored the ability of representative HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitor NVP-AUY922 to overcome TRAIL resistance by increasing apoptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The combination of TRAIL and NVP-AUY922 induced synergistic cytotoxicity and apoptosis, which was mediated through an increase in caspase activation. The treatment of NVP-AUY922 dephosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 and decreased Mcl-1, which resulted in facilitating cytochrome c release. NVP-AUY922-mediated inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling and down-regulation of their target gene, Mcl-1, occurred in a dose and time-dependent manner. Knock down of Mcl-1, STAT3 inhibitor or JAK2 inhibitor synergistically enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of the JAK2-STAT3-Mcl-1 signal transduction pathway in response to NVP-AUY922 treatment, which may play a key role in NVP-AUY922-mediated sensitization to TRAIL. By contrast, the effect of the combination treatments in non-transformed colon cells was minimal. We provide a clinical rationale that combining HSP90 inhibitor with TRAIL enhances therapeutic efficacy without increasing normal tissue toxicity in CRC patients.","['Lee, Dae-Hee', 'Sung, Ki Sa', 'Bartlett, David L', 'Kwon, Yong Tae', 'Lee, Yong J']","['Lee DH', 'Sung KS', 'Bartlett DL', 'Kwon YT', 'Lee YJ']","['Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.

Infection of cells with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) up-regulates the expression of a number of cellular genes, including those involved in T-lymphocyte activation. Previously, we demonstrated that this up-regulation occurs via the trans-activation activity of the M-MuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences which produce an LTR-encoded transcript. Sequence analysis of the LTR revealed a potential transcription unit for RNA polymerase III (Pol III) within the U3 region that is actively occupied by Pol II factors. Here, we provide the direct evidence of involvement of Pol III in the trans-activation process and demonstrate the precise localization of the intragenic control elements for accurate and active Pol III transcription. Deletions of a copy of the directed repeats and further immediate upstream sequences significantly abrogated the generation of LTR-encoded transcript and abolished the trans-activational activity, whereas the deletion of a copy of directed repeats alone proportionally reduced the transcript size, but still retained moderately high trans-activational activity. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the fraction containing a multiple transcription factor TFIIIC complex strongly bound to the LTR-U3 probe containing the essential control elements. The specificity of the DNA-TFIIIC interaction was confirmed by conducting competition assays with DNA fragments containing a genuine Pol III-transcribed gene, VA1, and by vaccinia virus infection which stimulates the expression of Pol III factors. However, a deletion mutant lacking an essential control element bound to the TFIIIC complex poorly, consequently resulting in weak Pol III transcription as assessed by an IRES-GFP reporter system. This correlation strongly supports the possibility that the generation of LTR-encoded transcript is directed by Pol III. Therefore, this finding suggests the involvement of Pol III transcription in the retrovirus-induced activation of cellular genes, potentially contributing to leukemogenesis.","['Hwang, Yong-Woo', 'Yoo, Na Kyung', 'Yang, Heung Mo', 'Choi, Sang-Yun']","['Hwang YW', 'Yoo NK', 'Yang HM', 'Choi SY']","['Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.

Fucoidan treatment inhibited apoptotic nuclei changes and phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure on neutrophils cultured in vitro for 24h. The delay in neutrophil apoptosis mediated by fucoidan was associated with increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and decreased levels of activated caspase-3. Screening of the signaling pathways by specific inhibitors indicated that fucoidan-induced delay in neutrophil apoptosis was dependent on the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, whereas MAPK signaling pathway was not critical. In addition, fucoidan enhanced the production of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha from neutrophils in an AKT-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrated that fucoidan delays human neutrophil apoptosis and induces their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This knowledge could facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases and neutropenia by controlling neutrophil homeostasis and function with fucoidan.","['Jin, Jun-O', 'Yu, Qing']","['Jin JO', 'Yu Q']","['Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

Many studies highlight the importance of conventional alphabeta T cell recovery after HSCT, but the impact of gammadelta T cell recovery has not been well described. Here, we investigate the recovery of gammadelta T cells in 102 pediatric patients with acute leukemia in first clinical remission who underwent allogeneic HSCT at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital from 1996 to 2011. Mean patient age was 10.5 +/- 5.9 years (range, .6 to 25.2), and mean survivor follow-up was 2.7 +/- 1.8 years (range, .12 to 6.0). Diagnoses included 59% patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 41% patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant impact of the maximum number of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells and donor source on the gammadelta T cell recovery (P < .0001, P < .0001, P < .0001, and P < .004, respectively). Univariate and multivariate models found the number of gammadelta T cells after HSCT to be associated with infections (P = .026 and P = .02, respectively). We found the probability of infections for patients with an elevated number of gammadelta T cells was significantly lower compared with patients with low or normal gammadelta T cells after HSCT (18% versus 54%; P = .025). Bacterial infections were not observed in patients with elevated gammadelta T cells. Finally, event-free survival was significantly higher in patients with enhanced gammadelta T cell reconstitution compared with patients with low/normal gammadelta T cell reconstitution after HSCT (91% versus 55%; P = .04). Thus, gammadelta T cells may play an important role in immune reconstitution after HSCT.","['Perko, Ross', 'Kang, Guolian', 'Sunkara, Anusha', 'Leung, Wing', 'Thomas, Paul G', 'Dallas, Mari H']","['Perko R', 'Kang G', 'Sunkara A', 'Leung W', 'Thomas PG', 'Dallas MH']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.

Therefore, it is important for physicians to know the current outcomes data when counseling potential candidates. To provide this information, we evaluated 15,059 unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplant recipients between 2000 and 2009. We compared outcomes before and after 2005 for 4 cohorts: age <18 years with malignant diseases (n = 1920), ages 18 to 59 years with malignant diseases (n = 9575), ages >/= 60 years with malignant diseases (n = 2194), and nonmalignant diseases (n = 1370). Three-year overall survival in 2005 to 2009 was significantly better in all 4 cohorts (<18 years: 55% versus 45%, 18 to 59 years: 42% versus 35%, >/= 60 years: 35% versus 25%, nonmalignant diseases: 69% versus 60%; P < .001 for all comparisons). Multivariate analyses in leukemia patients receiving HLA 7/8 to 8/8-matched transplants showed significant reduction in overall and nonrelapse mortality in the first year after HCT among patients who underwent transplantation in 2005 to 2009; however, risks for relapse did not change over time. Significant survival improvements after unrelated donor HCT have occurred over the recent decade and can be partly explained by better patient selection (eg, HCT earlier in the disease course and lower disease risk), improved donor selection (eg, more precise allele-level matched unrelated donors) and changes in transplantation practices.","['Majhail, Navneet S', 'Chitphakdithai, Pintip', 'Logan, Brent', 'King, Roberta', 'Devine, Steven', 'Rossmann, Susan N', 'Hale, Gregory', 'Hartzman, Robert J', 'Karanes, Chatchada', 'Laport, Ginna G', 'Nemecek, Eneida', 'Snyder, Edward L', 'Switzer, Galen E', 'Miller, John', 'Navarro, Willis', 'Confer, Dennis L', 'Levine, John E']","['Majhail NS', 'Chitphakdithai P', 'Logan B', 'King R', 'Devine S', 'Rossmann SN', 'Hale G', 'Hartzman RJ', 'Karanes C', 'Laport GG', 'Nemecek E', 'Snyder EL', 'Switzer GE', 'Miller J', 'Navarro W', 'Confer DL', 'Levine JE']","['Blood & Marrow Transplant Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio; National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and BMT, All Children's Hospital, St Petersburg, Florida."", 'Naval Medical Research Center, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California.', 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Departments of Medicine and Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical outcomes in terms of the time to the first treatment (TTFT) of a prospective cohort, including 125 patients with cMBL and 197 patients with CLL Rai stage 0. RESULTS: In the overall patient population, prognostic parameters such as IGHV gene mutational status (P < .0001), CD38 expression (P < .0001), 70-kDa zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) expression (P < .0001), and cytogenetic abnormalities (P = .01) predicted for TTFT on univariate analysis. IGHV gene identity was significant on multivariate analysis (P < .0001), regardless of the B-cell cutoff (5.0 or 10 x 10(9) B cells/L). A prognostic stratification using the combination of IGHV mutational status and absolute B-cell lymphocytosis identified 3 different groups that were significantly different with respect to the TTFT (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: In the present series of patients with cMBL and CLL Rai stage 0, we have confirmed that IGHV mutation status appeared to be the best predictor of TTFT. In addition, when associated with the B-cell count, IGHV mutational status might help to better stratify patients into more precise subgroups.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Molica S', 'Giannarelli D', 'Levato L', 'Gentile M', 'Mirabelli R', 'Morabito F']","['Department of Oncology-Hematology, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital Center, Catanzaro, Italy.

However, the prognosis after relapse after allo-SCT is still dismal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical outcome of therapy using dasatinib, a second-generation TKI, in 9 patients with relapsed Ph(+)ALL after allo-SCT. Dasatinib was initiated at a median time of 168 days after allo-SCT at dosages ranging from 20 mg to 100 mg daily. RESULTS: Six of 9 patients manifested a marked increase in large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), but all 6 patients discontinued dasatinib because of adverse events (AEs) such as pleural effusion. Four of 6 patients resumed dasatinib, and 3 of them have been alive with molecular complete remission and a persistent increase of LGLs. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that dasatinib therapy can induce LGL expansion accompanied by AEs, but this phenomenon can be associated with long-term survival benefit in a proportion of relapsed Ph(+)ALL patients after allo-SCT.","['Ito, Yoshikiyo', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Kamimura, Tomohiko', 'Aoki, Kenichi', 'Henzan, Hideho', 'Aoki, Takatoshi', 'Shiratsuchi, Motoaki', 'Kato, Koji', 'Nagafuji, Koji', 'Ogawa, Ryosuke', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Ito Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Kamimura T', 'Aoki K', 'Henzan H', 'Aoki T', 'Shiratsuchi M', 'Kato K', 'Nagafuji K', 'Ogawa R', 'Eto T', 'Iwasaki H', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University Beppu Hospital, Beppu, Japan; Department of Hematology, Harasanshin Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.

We systematically searched databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase; 1997 to August 2, 2012), conference abstracts, bibliographic reference lists, recent reviews, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Primary efficacy outcomes were objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Safety end points were Grade 3/4 toxicities, serious adverse events, withdrawals because of toxicity, and deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of relapsed or refractory CLL and if outcomes for CLL were reported separately from trials that included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting adjusted indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 6 RCTs of pharmacologic treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL. The most common drugs investigated (alone or in combination) were fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. When reported, median overall survival ranged from 27.3 to 52.9 months, and overall response rate from 58% to 82%. Although meta-analysis of efficacy results was considered, details are not presented because only 3 studies qualified and the common comparator treatment was not clinically relevant. The relatively small number of RCTs, few overlapping treatment arms, and variability in end points studied make it difficult to formally compare therapies for relapsed/refractory CLL. Significant variability in RCT features presents a further challenge to meaningful comparisons. Additional well-designed RCTs are needed to fully understand the relative efficacy and safety of older and more recently developed therapies.","['Police, Rachel L', 'Trask, Peter C', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Olivares, Robert', 'Khan, Shahnaz', 'Abbe, Adeline', 'Colosia, Ann', 'Njue, Annete', 'Sherrill, Beth', 'Ruiz-Soto, Rodrigo', 'Kaye, James A', 'Hamadani, Mehdi']","['Police RL', 'Trask PC', 'Wang J', 'Olivares R', 'Khan S', 'Abbe A', 'Colosia A', 'Njue A', 'Sherrill B', 'Ruiz-Soto R', 'Kaye JA', 'Hamadani M']","['RTI Health Solutions, Boston, MA.', 'Global Evidence and Value Development, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA.

Two types of mutations in the p53 gene were detected in myelocytomas of both the experimentally infected and the naturally infected chickens and included point mutations and deletions. Two of the point mutations have not been reported previously. Partial complementary DNA clones with a 122-bp deletion in the p53 gene ORF and a 15-bp deletion in the C-terminus were identified in the myelocytomas. In addition, moderate expression of the mutant p53 protein was detected in the myelocytomas that were distributed in the liver, trachea, spleen, and bone marrow. Mutant p53 protein was not detected in the subcutaneous hemangiomas or in the abdominal fibrosarcomas associated with natural and experimental ALV-J infection, respectively.

We describe a high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis to screen for SRSF2 hotspot mutations in a fast, sensitive, and reliable way. Fifty bone marrow samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were analyzed by the HRM assay and by direct sequencing. HRM screening identified four melting patterns corresponding to a negative (wild-type) group and three different mutated groups. Each mutated group was identified according to the positive control used: P95H, P95L, and P95R, respectively. An HRM mutated pattern was identified in seven patients. Positive and negative results from HRM were compared with direct sequencing results with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 0.56-1, and 95% CI, 0.89-1, respectively). Analytical sensitivity analysis revealed a detection threshold of up to 1:9 (mutated/wild type) dilution.

However, for the many patients unable to achieve this state, outcomes are poorly described and methods to improve results are unknown. We sought to describe the long-term follow-up and predictive factors for these poor-risk patients unable to achieve CR before NMAT. We identified and evaluated patients with iB-NHL including chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine/total body irradiation-based NMAT that had evidence of persistent disease before NMAT. From December 1998 to April 2009, 89 patients were identified, most commonly with small/chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 62) and follicular lymphoma (n = 24). Pretransplant anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using standard yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan was administered to 18 patients (20%) who more frequently had chemoresistant disease (81% versus 39%, P = .003), disease bulk > 5 cm (61% versus 15%, P < .001), thrombocytopenia < 25k/muL (33% versus 7%, P = .002), and Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index scores >/= 3 (72% versus 37%, P = .006). After adjusting for these imbalances, RIT-treated patients had improved rates of progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] = .4; 95% confidence interval [CI], .2 to .9, P = .02) and overall survival (OS) (HR = .3; 95% CI, .1 to .8, P = .008) compared with the non-RIT group. The 3-year adjusted estimates of PFS and OS for the RIT and non-RIT groups were 71% and 87% versus 44% and 59%, respectively. The use of RIT was the only factor independently associated with improved PFS and OS. Rates of nonrelapse mortality and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were similar between the 2 groups, although over 70% of patients developed clinically significant acute or chronic GVHD. In conclusion, despite relatively high rates of GVHD, patients with persistent iB-NHL can derive durable benefit from NMAT.","['Cassaday, Ryan D', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Guthrie, Katherine A', 'Maloney, David G', 'Rajendran, Joseph G', 'Pagel, John M', 'Flowers, Mary E', 'Green, Damian J', 'Rezvani, Andrew R', 'Storb, Rainer F', 'Press, Oliver W', 'Gopal, Ajay K']","['Cassaday RD', 'Storer BE', 'Sorror ML', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Guthrie KA', 'Maloney DG', 'Rajendran JG', 'Pagel JM', 'Flowers ME', 'Green DJ', 'Rezvani AR', 'Storb RF', 'Press OW', 'Gopal AK']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.

This study used the central database of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) to describe time trends for cGVHD incidence, nonrelapse mortality, and risk factors for cGVHD. The 12-year period was divided into 3 intervals, 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2003, and 2004 to 2007, and included 26,563 patients with acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Multivariate analysis showed an increased incidence of cGVHD in more recent years (odds ratio = 1.19, P < .0001), and this trend was still seen when adjusting for donor type, graft type, or conditioning intensity. In patients with cGVHD, nonrelapse mortality has decreased over time, but at 5 years there were no significant differences among different time periods. Risk factors for cGVHD were in line with previous studies. This is the first comprehensive characterization of the trends in cGVHD incidence and underscores the mounting need for addressing this major late complication of transplantation in future research.","['Arai, Sally', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Wang, Tao', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'He, Wensheng', 'Couriel, Daniel R', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea A', 'Battiwalla,

In fully differentiated cells, SALL4 expression is down-regulated or silenced. Accumulating evidence suggest that SALL4 expression is reactivated in cancer. Constitutive expression of SALL4 transgene readily induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development in mice. Gain- and loss-of-function studies reveal that SALL4 regulates proliferation, apoptosis, invasive migration, chemoresistance, and the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). SALL4 controls the expression of its downstream genes through both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. High level of SALL4 expression is detected in cancer patients, which predicts adverse progression and poor outcome. Moreover, targeted inhibition of SALL4 has shown efficient therapeutic effects on cancer. We have summarized the recent advances in the biology of SALL4 with a focus on its role in cancer. Further study of the oncogenic functions of SALL4 and the underlying molecular mechanisms will shed light on cancer biology and provide new implications for cancer diagnostics and therapy.","['Zhang, Xu', 'Yuan, Xiao', 'Zhu, Wei', 'Qian, Hui', 'Xu, Wenrong']","['Zhang X', 'Yuan X', 'Zhu W', 'Qian H', 'Xu W']","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212013, China.

In order to further characterize the functional role of HSC70 in regulating MTX resistance in L1210 cells, we first showed that HSC70 colocalizes and interacts with reduced folate carrier (RFC) in L1210 cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay. The tyrosine phosphorylation status of HSC70 found in the membrane fraction was different from the parental L1210/0 and cisplatin (CDDP)-MTX cross resistant L1210/DDP cells. In MTX-binding assays, HSC70 from L1210/DDP cells showed less affinity for MTX-agarose beads than that of L1210/0 cells. In addition, genistein (a tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor) significantly enhanced the resistance of L1210/0 cells to MTX. Moreover, site-directed mutation studies indicated the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation of HSC70 in regulating its binding to MTX.

However, the regulation of leukemia initiating cells for the leukemia progression is poorly understood. In this study, we observed that beta-Arrestin1, a multiple-function protein, is elevated in leukemia initiating cells-enriched fraction from B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. The loss of beta-Arrestin1 in leukemia initiating cells-enriched fraction attenuates its self-renewal capacity both in vitro and in vivo. Further experiments showed that the mRNA expression level of beta-Arrestin1 is negatively correlated with that of PTEN in leukemia initiating cells-enriched fraction. Moreover, DNA methylation of the PTEN promoter region, the activity and expression of DNMTs were enhanced in the leukemia initiating cells-enriched fraction. The inhibition of DNMT1 activity impaired the self-renewal and increased expression of PTEN of leukemia initiating cells-enriched fraction. In addition, depletion of beta-Arrestin1 significantly decreased DNMT1 activity and PTEN methylation, and consistently increased PTEN expression in leukemia initiating cells-enriched fraction. Our study reveals a novel function of beta-Arrestin1 in the regulation of the self-renewal of leukemia initiating cells-enriched fraction from B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients related to DNMT1 activity, indicating that beta-Arrestin1 is a potential therapeutic target in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Shu, Yi', 'Zhou, Xiaoyan', 'Qi, Xinkun', 'Liu, Shan', 'Li, Kang', 'Tan, Junjie', 'Liu, Zhidai', 'Yu, Jie', 'Zhang, Penghui', 'Zou, Lin']","['Shu Y', 'Zhou X', 'Qi X', 'Liu S', 'Li K', 'Tan J', 'Liu Z', 'Yu J', 'Zhang P', 'Zou L']","[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Chongqing Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technical Research Center, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Chongqing Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technical Research Center, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Chongqing Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technical Research Center, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Chongqing Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technical Research Center, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China; Chongqing Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technical Research Center, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China.

STUDY DESIGN: Episodes of fever without neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >/=500 cells/mm(3)) were reviewed retrospectively in pediatric oncology patients with a CVC undergoing chemotherapy. Characteristics and symptoms were compared between patients with bacteremia and patients without bacteremia. RESULTS: A total of 392 episodes of nonneutropenic fever in 138 subjects (52 females; 38%) were reviewed. In this cohort, the median age at an episode was 7 years, and the majority of patients had a diagnosis of acute leukemia (54%). Median ANC was 3100 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 1570-5980 cells/mm(3)). Median temperature was 38.7 degrees C (IQR, 38.3-39.2 degrees C). Twenty-four infectious episodes (6%) occurred in 18 subjects, and 5 CVCs required removal; all patients requiring removal admitted and received antibiotics owing to chills. There were no significant difference in age, sex, or ANC between patients with bacteremia and those without bacteremia; however, mean temperature was higher in the patients with bacteremia (39.4 degrees C vs 38.7 degrees C; P = .003). No deaths due to sepsis occurred, and no CVCs were removed because antibiotics were not administered empirically. CONCLUSION: Our practice of observing pediatric oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy with CVCs who are not neutropenic does not appear to lead to increased serious adverse outcomes and avoids antibiotic exposure for >90% of patients without a bacterial infection.","['Bartholomew, Frederick', 'Aftandilian, Catherine', 'Andrews, Jennifer', 'Gutierrez, Kathleen', 'Luna-Fineman, Sandra', 'Jeng, Michael']","['Bartholomew F', 'Aftandilian C', 'Andrews J', 'Gutierrez K', 'Luna-Fineman S', 'Jeng M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.

To investigate the potential of NSAs for the induction of neuronal differentiation, we developed a novel phenotypic assay based on a human neuron-committed teratocarcinoma cell line (NT2) as a model for neuronal progenitors and constructed a NT2-based reporter cell line that expressed eGFP under the control of a neuron-specific promoter. We tested 38 structurally related NSAs and determined their activity to induce neuronal differentiation by immunocytochemistry of neuronal marker proteins, live cell imaging, fluorometric detection and immunoblot analysis. We identified twelve NSAs, which induced neuronal differentiation to different extents. NSAs with highest activity carried a halogen substituent at their pyrimidine nucleobase and an unmodified or 2'-O-methyl substituted 2-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl residue as glyconic moiety. Cladribine, a purine nucleoside with similar structural features and in use to treat leukemia and multiple sclerosis, induced also differentiation of adult human neural crest-derived stem cells. Our results suggest that NSAs could be useful for the manipulation of neuronal cell fate in cell replacement therapy or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The data on the structure and function relationship will help to design compounds with increased activity and low toxicity.","['Raasch, Katharina', 'Malecki, Edith', 'Siemann, Maria', 'Martinez, Malayko M', 'Heinisch, Jurgen J', 'Muller, Janine', 'Bakota, Lidia', 'Kaltschmidt, Christian', 'Kaltschmidt, Barbara', 'Rosemeyer, Helmut', 'Brandt, Roland']","['Raasch K', 'Malecki E', 'Siemann M', 'Martinez MM', 'Heinisch JJ', 'Muller J', 'Bakota L', 'Kaltschmidt C', 'Kaltschmidt B', 'Rosemeyer H', 'Brandt R']","['Department of Neurobiology, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 11, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Institute of Chemistry of New Materials, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 7, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Department of Neurobiology, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 11, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Department of Neurobiology, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 11, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 11, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Neurobiology, University of Bielefeld, Universitatsstrasse 25, 33615, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'Department of Neurobiology, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 11, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Neurobiology, University of Bielefeld, Universitatsstrasse 25, 33615, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Neurobiology, University of Bielefeld, Universitatsstrasse 25, 33615, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'Institute of Chemistry of New Materials, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 7, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.', 'Department of Neurobiology, University of Osnabruck, Barbarastrasse 11, 49076, Osnabruck, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,,['NOTNLM'],"['adult human stem cell', 'cladribine', 'human model neuron', 'neuronal differentiation', 'nucleoside analog']",2014/12/03 06:00,2016/06/03 06:00,['2014/12/03 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cbdd.12488 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2015 Aug;86(2):129-43. doi: 10.1111/cbdd.12488.

Our patient had a marked improvement in symptoms after plasmapheresis. CONCLUSION: Including our patient, there have been at least eight cases of post-transplant autoimmune myelitis presented in the literature, and at least three of these are suspicious for neuromyelitis optica. Several of these patients had poor outcomes with persistent symptoms after the myelitis. Autoimmune processes such as neuromyelitis optica should be carefully considered in patients after transplant as aggressive treatment like early plasmapheresis may improve outcomes.","['Baumer, Fiona M', 'Kamihara, Junne', 'Gorman, Mark P']","['Baumer FM', 'Kamihara J', 'Gorman MP']","[""Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

We created 6 CMML subgroups, by dividing dysplastic and proliferative CMML at the cut-off of white blood cell count of 13,000/muL and splitting these two groups into 3 subgroups: CMML 0 with <5% blasts (n=101), CMML I with 5-9% blasts (n=204) and CMML II with 10-19% blasts (n=81). For comparison we included patients with RCMD, RAEB I and II.

Median survival times between the corresponding dysplastic and proliferative subgroups 0 and 1 differed significantly: CMML 0 dysplastic 48ms and CMML 0 proliferative 17ms (p=0.03), CMML I dysplastic 29ms and CMML I proliferative 15ms (p=0.008), CMML II dysplastic 17ms and CMML II proliferative 10ms (p=0.09). Outcome of CMML patients worsens with increasing medullary blasts and when presenting as proliferative type. Therefore it is justified to separate CMML with <5% medullary blasts.","['Schuler, E', 'Schroeder, M', 'Neukirchen, J', 'Strupp, C', 'Xicoy, B', 'Kundgen, A', 'Hildebrandt, B', 'Haas, R', 'Gattermann, N', 'Germing, U']","['Schuler E', 'Schroeder M', 'Neukirchen J', 'Strupp C', 'Xicoy B', 'Kundgen A', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N', 'Germing U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany.

Treatment response, dose, and schedule were assessed. METHODS: This non-interventional, post-marketing survey included 49/50 patients receiving azacitidine at 14 Belgian haematology centres from 2010-2012. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including treatment-related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs (TESAEs) were recorded throughout the study. Treatment response [complete response (CR), partial response (PR), haematological improvement (HI), stable disease (SD), treatment failure (TF)) and transfusion-independence (TI) were evaluated at completion of a 1-year observation period (1YOP) or at treatment discontinuation, and overall survival (OS), at study conclusion. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 74.7 (range: 43.9-87.8) years; 69.4% had MDS, 26.5% had primary or secondary AML, and 4.1% had CMML. Treatment-related TEAEs, grade 3-4 TEAEs, and TESAEs were reported in 67.3%, 28.6%, and 18.4% of patients, respectively. During 1YOP, patients received a median of 7 (1-12) treatment cycles. Treatment response was assessed for 38/49 patients. Among MDS and CMML patients (n = 29), 41.4% had CR, PR, or HI, 41.4% had SD, and 17.2% had TF. Among AML patients (n = 9), 44.4% had CR or PR, 33.3% had SD, and 22.2% had TF. TI was observed in 14/32 (43.8%) patients who were transfusion-dependent at baseline. Median (95% confidence interval) OS was 490 (326-555) days; 1-year OS estimate was 0.571 (0.422-0.696).

The dynamic interaction between AML cells and bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays a critical role in response of this disease to chemotherapy. It is reported that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are essential component of bone marrow microenvironment which affects the survival of AML cells. The aim of our research is to elucidate the mechanism of drug resistance of AML cells associated with MSC. We found that adhesion of AML cell lines U937, KG1a and primary AML cells to MSC inhibited cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. Western blot showed that c-Myc of AML cells cocultured with stroma was up-regulated. Treatment with 10058-F4, a small molecule inhibitor of MYC-MAX heterodimerization, or c-Myc siRNA significantly induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis further showed that inhibition of c-Myc induced expression of caspases-3, cleavage of PARP and reduced expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus, we conclude that MSCs protected leukemia cells from apoptosis, at least in part, through c-Myc dependent mechanisms, and that c-Myc contributed to microenvironment-mediated drug resistance in AML. In summary, we declared that c-Myc is a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in AML.","['Xia, Bing', 'Tian, Chen', 'Guo, Shanqi', 'Zhang, Le', 'Zhao, Dandan', 'Qu, Fulian', 'Zhao, Weipeng', 'Wang, Yafei', 'Wu, Xiaoxiong', 'Da, Wanming', 'Wei, Sheng', 'Zhang, Yizhuo']","['Xia B', 'Tian C', 'Guo S', 'Zhang L', 'Zhao D', 'Qu F', 'Zhao W', 'Wang Y', 'Wu X', 'Da W', 'Wei S', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.', ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.', ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Immunology, H.

METHODS: A rapidly growing selected root line of L. leonii was grown in 2-L bioreactor for period of 40 days and the protocols for obtaining of the compound have been optimized. The pharmacological study included evaluation of the cytotoxicity of the compound in HL-60 cells (MTT-assay), its apoptogenic effects and its effects on caspase 3,8 and 9 activation. RESULTS: After 40 days of sterile run scale up of hairy root culture in bioreactor, 27.2g/L dry weight of root biomass was harvested from the bioreactor culture vessel, recording about nine times increase over initial inoculum (3.0g), with 1.55%+/-0.07 Justicidin B, greater than yields from 300ml flasks. Our findings are the first work toward the scale up of L. leonii hairy roots-based biotechnological production of Justicidin B, employing bioreactors for high biomass production to meet the industrial requirement. The results from the pharmacological evaluation have shown that the tested arylnaphtalene lignan is a potent cytotoxic and proapoptotic agent against HL-60. The induction of apoptosis proceeds via activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial cell-death signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: The potent activity at low micromolar concentration and the feasibility of biotechnological production of justicidin B implies that there is enormous scope in its further evaluation as possible antineoplastic drug candidate.","['Momekov, Georgi', 'Yossifov, Deyan', 'Guenova, Margarita', 'Michova, Albena', 'Stoyanov, Nikolay', 'Konstantinov, Spiro', 'Ionkov, Todor', 'Sacheva, Pavlina', 'Ionkova, Iliana']","['Momekov G', 'Yossifov D', 'Guenova M', 'Michova A', 'Stoyanov N', 'Konstantinov S', 'Ionkov T', 'Sacheva P', 'Ionkova I']","['Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacotherapy and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria.

Therefore, novel approaches and targets for chemotherapeutic treatment of malignancies are urgently required. Recent studies demonstrated the expression of several potassium channels in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Among them the voltage gated potassium channel Kv1.3 and the big-potassium (BK) channel were shown to directly function in cell death by serving as target for pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins. Here, we discuss the role of mitochondrial potassium channel Kv1.3 (mitoKv1.3) in cell death and its potential function in treatment of solid tumors, leukemia and lymphoma. Bax and Bak inhibit mitoKv1.3 by directly binding into the pore of the channel, by a toxin-like mechanism. Inhibition of mitoKv1.3 results in an initial hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane that triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS in turn induce a release of cytochrome c from the cristae of the inner mitochondrial membrane and an activation of the permeability transition pore, resulting in opening of the intrinsic apoptotic cell death. Since mitoKv1.3 functions downstream of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak, compounds that directly inhibit mitoKv1.3 may serve as a new class of drugs for treatment of tumors, even with an altered expression of either pro- or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. This was successfully proven by the in vivo treatment of mouse melanoma and ex vivo human chronic leukemia B cells with inhibitors of mitoKv1.3.","['Leanza, Luigi', 'Venturini, Elisa', 'Kadow, Stephanie', 'Carpinteiro, Alexander', 'Gulbins, Erich', 'Becker, Katrin Anne']","['Leanza L', 'Venturini E', 'Kadow S', 'Carpinteiro A', 'Gulbins E', 'Becker KA']","['Department of Biology, University of Padova, Viale G.

Naturally occurring chalcones possess a wide range of biological activities including anti-cancer effects. In this work, we evaluated the antiproliferative activity of three chalcones [4'-hydroxy-2',6'-dimethoxychalcone (1), cardamomin (2), 2',4'-dihydroxy-3',6'-dimethoxychalcone (3)], and four flavanones [(S)-(-)-pinostrobin (4), (S)-(-)-onysilin (5) and alpinetin (6)] toward nine cancer cell lines amongst which were multidrug resistant (MDR) types. METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay was used to detect the antiproliferative activity of the studied samples whilst flow cytometry for the mechanistic studies of the most active molecule (1). RESULTS: IC50 values in a range of 2.54 muM against CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells to 58.63 muM toward hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells were obtained with 1. The lowest IC50 values of 8.59 muM for 2 and 10.67 muM for 3 were found against CCRF-CEM cells leukemia cells, whilst the corresponding values were above 80 muM for 4 and 6. P-glycoprotein-expressing and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells were much more sensitive toward compound 1 than toward doxorubicin and low cross-resistance or even collateral sensitivity was observed in other drug-resistent cell lines to this compound. Normal liver AML12 cells were more resistant to the studied compounds than HepG2 liver cancer cells, indicating tumor specificity at least to some extent. Compound 1 arrested the cell cycle between Go/G1 phase, strongly induced apoptosis via disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the studied leukemia cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Chalcone 1 was the best tested cytotoxic molecule and further studies will be performed in order to envisage its possible use in the fight against multifactorial resistant cancer cells.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Nkuete, Antoine H L', 'Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Wiench, Benjamin', 'Wabo, Hippolyte K', 'Tane, Pierre', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Nkuete AH', 'Mbaveng AT', 'Wiench B', 'Wabo HK', 'Tane P', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.O.

Apoptotic phenotypes including apoptotic body formation, DNA laddering, caspase 3 activation and cleavage of PARP proteins were induced by CM(FB) treatment but only slightly induced by same concentration of CM(MY) treatment in human HL-60 leukemia cells. Cordycepin in CM(FB) (10.47 mg/g) is significantly higher ( approximately 15.2 times) than that of CM(MY) (0.69 mg/g). Using isobolographic analysis, the synergy of cytotoxicity was observed across different combined concentrations of CM(MY) and cordycepin. By complementing cordycepin into CM(MY) to the level comparable with CM(FB), we observed that CM(MY) (500 mug/ml) with cordycepin (4.8 mug/ml) induced apoptosis to a level similar to that induced by CM(FB) (500 mug/ml). Together, our results suggest that cordycepin possesses a synergistic cytotoxic effect with Cordyceps militaris-mediated apoptosis in human leukemia cells and therefore explaining a better anti-proliferating activity of CM(FB) over CM(MY).","['Chou, Shang-Min', 'Lai, Wan-Jung', 'Hong, Tzu-Wen', 'Lai, Jui-Ya', 'Tsai, Sheng-Hong', 'Chen, Yen-Hsun', 'Yu, Sz-Hsien', 'Kao, Cheng-Hsiang', 'Chu, Richard', 'Ding, Shih-Torng', 'Li, Tsai-Kun', 'Shen, Tang-Long']","['Chou SM', 'Lai WJ', 'Hong TW', 'Lai JY', 'Tsai SH', 'Chen YH', 'Yu SH', 'Kao CH', 'Chu R', 'Ding ST', 'Li TK', 'Shen TL']","['Department and Graduate Institute of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan; Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Department of Animal Science and Technology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Department and Graduate Institute of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study focuses on 15 patients treated between 1961 and 1996. Whole-body RT planning computed tomographic (CT) data were not available. We therefore generated representative whole-body CTs similar to patient anatomy. In addition, we developed a method enabling us to obtain information on the density distribution of ABM all over the skeleton. Dose could then be calculated in a series of points distributed all over the skeleton in such a way that their local density reflected age-specific data for ABM distribution. Dose to particular regions and dose-volume histograms of the entire ABM were estimated for all patients. RESULTS: Depending on patient age, the total number of dose calculation points generated ranged from 1,190,970 to 4,108,524. The average dose to ABM ranged from 0.3 to 16.4 Gy. Dose-volume histograms analysis showed that the median doses (D50%) ranged from 0.06 to 12.8 Gy. We also evaluated the inhomogeneity of individual patient ABM dose distribution according to clinical situation. It was evident that the coefficient of variation of the dose for the whole ABM ranged from 1.0 to 5.7, which means that the standard deviation could be more than 5 times higher than the mean. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with available long-term follow-up data, our method provides reconstruction of dose-volume data comparable to detailed dose calculations, which have become standard in modern CT-based 3-dimensional RT planning. Our strategy of using dose-volume histograms offers new perspectives to retrospective epidemiological studies.","['Veres, Cristina', 'Allodji, Rodrigue S', 'Llanas, Damien', 'Vu Bezin, Jeremi', 'Chavaudra, Jean', 'Mege, Jean Pierre', 'Lefkopoulos, Dimitri', 'Quiniou, Eric', 'Deutsh, Eric', 'de Vathaire, Florent', 'Diallo, Ibrahima']","['Veres C', 'Allodji RS', 'Llanas D', 'Vu Bezin J', 'Chavaudra J', 'Mege JP', 'Lefkopoulos D', 'Quiniou E', 'Deutsh E', 'de Vathaire F', 'Diallo I']","['Radiation Epidemiology Group, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR 1018, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; University Paris-Sud XI, Villejuif, France.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Group, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR 1018, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; University Paris-Sud XI, Villejuif, France.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Group, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR 1018, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; University Paris-Sud XI, Villejuif, France.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Group, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR 1018, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; University Paris-Sud XI, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR 759, Orsay, France.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR 1030, Villejuif, France.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Group, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR 1018, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; University Paris-Sud XI, Villejuif, France.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Group, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR 1018, Villejuif, France; Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; University Paris-Sud XI, Villejuif, France.

Despite even the most aggressive and well-developed strategies for care, most patients succumb to the disease. No currently available treatment has demonstrated consistent efficacy in terms of remission induction or long-term survival. This review will highlight some of the emerging strategies to treat high-risk AML with an emphasis on clinical trials of novel strategies currently enrolling patients. Targeted molecular therapies, novel cytotoxics, and immune-based therapies are under investigation for the management of high-risk AML. Some of the agents covered include tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted to AML specific oncoproteins, nanoparticle formulations of existing drugs, nucleoside analogs, monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antigen receptors, bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies, and vaccines. As our understanding of the biology of AML has improved, targeted therapy for AML has emerged, offering to change not only response rate, but also the nature of response. Differentiation, rather than necrosis or apoptosis, is often seen in response to targeted agents and may be seen more frequently in the future. Interventions that might be more widely used in the near future include FLT3 inhibitors and nanoparticle formulations of drugs already known to have activity in the disease. Long term immune therapy holds significant promise.","['Sasine, Joshua P', 'Schiller, Gary J']","['Sasine JP', 'Schiller GJ']","['UCLA Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Health Sciences, Room 42-121, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

In the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, population 4.6 million, CLL patients receive uniform evaluation and therapy with FISH testing performed in three jurisdictions. The aims of this study were to (i) validate CLL-FISH testing among the BC cytogenetic laboratories to ensure standardization of results and (ii) characterize population-level CLL-FISH abnormalities by pooling provincial data. From 2004 to 2011, 585 consecutive patients underwent pretreatment CLL-FISH testing at laboratory A (50.1%), laboratory B (32.3%), or laboratory C (17.6%). For validation purposes, 26 CLL-FISH abnormalities were tested by each laboratory's protocol, with 91% result concordance. Discordant results involved percent abnormalities at or near cutoff values; therefore, a 10% universal cutoff was established when pooling results. Applying the universal cutoff to the provincial cohort, CLL-FISH abnormalities were detected in 74.9%: 54.9% 13q-, 18.8% +12, 8.5% 11q-, and 7.7% 17p-. In this large population-based cohort of patients referred for CLL-FISH testing, frequencies of abnormalities detected by FISH analysis were highly consistent with those reported in single-institution and clinical trial populations.

The high frequency of rare structural chromosome abnormalities at relapse in our case series supports a role of genomic instability in the genesis of relapse, and suggests that reactive oxygen species-generating and DNA repair pathways might be therapeutic targets in FLT3-ITD AML.","['Gourdin, Theodore S', 'Zou, Ying', 'Ning, Yi', 'Emadi, Ashkan', 'Duong, Vu H', 'Tidwell, Michael L', 'Chen, Ching', 'Rassool, Feyruz V', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Gourdin TS', 'Zou Y', 'Ning Y', 'Emadi A', 'Duong VH', 'Tidwell ML', 'Chen C', 'Rassool FV', 'Baer MR']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

TPMT heterozygotes had significantly more frequent cytopenias and therefore required dose adjustments below target levels significantly more often than TPMT wild-type patients although the average dose range was similar for both genotypes. Event-free survival (EFS) for patients heterozygous for the more common TPMT*1/*3A variant allele (n = 99, 5-year EFS 88%) was better than for both wild-type TPMT*1/*1 (n = 1206, EFS 80%, P = 0.05) and TPMT*1/*3C patients (n = 17, EFS 53%, P = 0.002); outcomes supported by a multivariate Cox regression analysis. Poor compliance without subsequent clinician intervention was associated with a worse EFS (P = 0.02) and such non-compliance may have contributed to the poorer outcome for TPMT*1/*3C patients. Patients prescribed escalated doses had a worse EFS (P = 0.04), but there was no difference in EFS by dose intensity or duration of cytopenias. In contrast to reports from some USA and Nordic trials, TPMT heterozygosity was not associated with a higher rate of second cancers. In conclusion, TPMT*1/*3A heterozygotes had a better EFS than TPMT wild-type patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the incidence of melanoma in patients with a history of CLL or NHL, and their associated mortality. METHODS: Cohorts of Kaiser Permanente Southern California members with a history of CLL and NHL were identified. Age-adjusted incidence density rates of melanoma among patients with CLL or NHL were compared with rates of melanoma among the general population of Kaiser Permanente Southern California patients. The mortality of patients with melanoma was examined using Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate per 100,000 person-years for melanoma among patients with either CLL or NHL was 107 (95% confidence interval 84.4-129.6) versus 25.9 among the general population (95% confidence interval 84.4-129.6, P < .001). Patients with melanoma and a history of CLL or NHL had 2.46 greater odds of death compared with those without CLL or NHL (95% confidence interval 1.77-3.41). LIMITATIONS: This study was retrospective in nature; the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes used may contain diagnostic errors; and only overall survival was used in our analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of CLL or NHL have a higher incidence of melanoma. Patients with CLL or NHL who are subsequently given the diagnosis of melanoma have a higher mortality than patients with melanoma without a preceding diagnosis of CLL.","['Famenini, Shannon', 'Martires, Kathryn J', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Xavier, Marin F', 'Wu, Jashin J']","['Famenini S', 'Martires KJ', 'Zhou H', 'Xavier MF', 'Wu JJ']","['David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California.', 'Scripps Cancer Center, San Diego, California.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.

The innate immune system is the first line defense system in prevention of further bacterial and viral infections. Cytokines play key roles in the innate immune system. In this study, we used RT-qPCR technology to test the cytokine mRNA expression levels in various immune tissues, including the spleen, bursa of fabricius and cecal tonsil, in the days following ALV-J infection. The results indicated that in the infected group, the expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-18, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma significantly increased in the spleen and reached peak levels that were thousandfolds higher than baselines at 9-12 days post-infection (d.p.i.). The levels in the bursa of fabricius slightly increased, and the levels in the cecal tonsil were not significantly altered. Moreover, the pattern of the expression of these three cytokines in the spleens of the infected group was similar to the pattern of viremia of this group. These results suggest that the spleen plays an important role in the interaction between ALV-J infection and the innate immune system. This study contributes to the understanding of innate immune responses to ALV-J infection and also elucidates the mechanisms of the pathogenicity of ALV-J in chickens.","['Gao, Yanni', 'Liu, Yongzhen', 'Guan, Xiaolu', 'Li, Xiaofei', 'Yun, Bingling', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Cui, Hongyu', 'Liu, Changjun', 'Zhang, Yanping', 'Wang, Xiaomei', 'Gao, Yulong']","['Gao Y', 'Liu Y', 'Guan X', 'Li X', 'Yun B', 'Qi X', 'Wang Y', 'Gao H', 'Cui H', 'Liu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X', 'Gao Y']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, No. 427, Maduan Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang Province, PR China.

We previously reported on the identification of a natural product marinopyrrole A (1) that induces apoptosis in Mcl-1-dependent cells through Mcl-1 degradation. Here, we report the design and synthesis of novel marinopyrrole-based analogs and their evaluation as selective inhibitors of Mcl-1 as well as dual Mcl-1/Bcl-xL inhibitors. The most selective Mcl-1 antagonists were 34, 36 and 37 with 16-, 13- and 9-fold more selectivity for disrupting Mcl-1/Bim over Bcl-xL/Bim binding, respectively. Among the most potent dual inhibitors is 42 which inhibited Mcl-1/Bim and Bcl-xL/Bim binding 15-fold (IC50 = 600 nM) and 33-fold (500 nM) more potently than (+/-)-marinopyrrole A (1), respectively. Fluorescence quenching, NMR analysis and molecular docking indicated binding of marinopyrroles to the BH3 binding site of Mcl-1. Several marinopyrroles potently decreased Mcl-1 cellular levels and induced caspase 3 activation in human breast cancer cells. Our studies provide novel ""lead"" marinopyrroles for further optimization as selective Mcl-1 inhibitors and dual Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL inhibitors.","['Li, Rongshi', 'Cheng, Chunwei', 'Balasis, Maria E', 'Liu, Yan', 'Garner, Thomas P', 'Daniel, Kenyon G', 'Li, Jerry', 'Qin, Yong', 'Gavathiotis, Evripidis', 'Sebti, Said M']","['Li R', 'Cheng C', 'Balasis ME', 'Liu Y', 'Garner TP', 'Daniel KG', 'Li J', 'Qin Y', 'Gavathiotis E', 'Sebti SM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Drug Discovery, College of Pharmacy, Cancer Genes and Molecular Regulation Program, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 986805 Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, United States.', 'Department of Drug Discovery, Chemical Biology & Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, United States.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, 12901 Bruce B.

However, global HDAC enzymatic activity has never been investigated in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). We measured HDAC activity in protein extracts from CD19+ B-cells purified from 114 CLL patients with a median follow-up of 91 months (range: 11-376). HDAC activity was equivalent in CLL and normal B-cells but higher in patients who died during the study than in living patients (152.1 vs. 65.04 pmol; P = 0.0060). Furthermore, HDAC activity correlated with treatment-free survival (TFS; P = 0.0156) and overall survival (OS; P < 0.0001): patients with low HDAC activity (n = 75) had a median TFS and OS of 101 and > 376 months, respectively, whereas patients with high HDAC activity (n = 39) had a median TFS and OS of 47 and 137 months, respectively. Multivariate analyses indicated that HDAC activity is an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio = 7.68; P = 0.0017). Finally, HDAC activity increased after B-cell receptor stimulation using IgM, suggesting a role for microenvironment stimuli (n = 10; P = 0.0371). In conclusion, high HDAC activity in CLL B-cells is associated with shorter TFS and OS and is an independent marker of OS, refining the use of other prognostic factors. This work provides a biological base for the use of HDAC inhibitors in CLL treatment.","['Van Damme, Michael', 'Crompot, Emerence', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Mineur, Philippe', 'Dessars, Barbara', 'El Housni, Hakim', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile']","['Van Damme M', 'Crompot E', 'Meuleman N', 'Mineur P', 'Dessars B', 'El Housni H', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L', 'Stamatopoulos B']","['a Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy; Faculty of Medicine; Institut Jules Bordet ; Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) ; Brussels , Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,PMC4622440,['NOTNLM'],"['B2M, Beta-2-microglobulin', 'BCR, B cell receptor', 'CLL, Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'FCR Fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab', 'HDAC', 'HDAC, Histone deacetylase', 'HDACi, HDAC inhibitor', 'HR Hazard ratio', 'IgHV, Immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region', 'LDT, Lymphocyte doubling time', 'LPL, Lipoprotein lipase', 'MSC, Mesenchymal stromal cell', 'NF-kappaB, Nuclear factor kappaB', 'OS, Overall survival', 'SAHA, Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid', 'SIRT, Sirtuin', 'Sirtuin', 'TFS, Treatment-free survival', 'VPA, Valproic acid', 'ZAP70, Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'enzymatic activity', 'prognosis', 'sCD23, Soluble CD23']",2014/12/02 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15592294.2014.969628 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2014 Oct;9(10):1374-81. doi: 10.4161/15592294.2014.969628.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding has not been reported previously to the best of our knowledge.","['Kim, Jaehyup', 'Bu, Lihong', 'Koduru, Prasad R', 'Wilson, Kathleen S', 'Fuda, Franklin S', 'Kumar, Kirthi R', 'Timmons, Charles F', 'Slone, Tamra L', 'Luu, Hung S']","['Kim J', 'Bu L', 'Koduru PR', 'Wilson KS', 'Fuda FS', 'Kumar KR', 'Timmons CF', 'Slone TL', 'Luu HS']","[""1 Department of Pathology, Children's Medical Center, Parkland Health and Hospital System, and UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20141201,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage', 'cytogenetics', 'mixed phenotype acute leukemia']",2014/12/02 06:00,2015/03/24 06:00,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2350/14-07-1521-CR.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2015 Jan-Feb;18(1):76-9. doi: 10.2350/14-07-1521-CR.1.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), as a monotherapy or combination therapy, have been successfully used to treat APL primarily by targeting the degradation of the fusion protein. We previously observed that ATO treatment induced cell death in APL cell line HL-60 accompanied by inhibition of the human telomere reverse transcriptase (hTERT) activity, a critical enzyme responsible for the control of cell replication and transformation in cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which hTERT activity is inhibited by ATO in HL-60 cells. Our results showed that ATO down-regulated the expression of hTERT at both mRNA and protein levels. Further molecular analysis revealed that the expression of four transcription factors Sp1, c-Myc, NF-kappaB and USF2, which are located in the proximate promoter region (-1126 to -47) of hTERT, was also suppressed by ATO. Notably, we observed that down-regulation of these four factors by their siRNAs potentiates ATO-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Therefore, our results provide a novel mechanism of action of ATO for the treatment of APL.","['Zhang, Yao', 'Sun, Miao', 'Shi, Weiwei', 'Yang, Qingling', 'Chen, Changjie', 'Wang, Zhiwei', 'Zhou, Xin']","['Zhang Y', 'Sun M', 'Shi W', 'Yang Q', 'Chen C', 'Wang Z', 'Zhou X']","['Center for Gene Diagnosis, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Donghu Road 169, Wuhan 430071, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241000, China.', 'Clinical Laboratories of Bengbu Medical College, Anhui 233030, China.', 'Clinical Laboratories of Bengbu Medical College, Anhui 233030, China.', 'Clinical Laboratories of Bengbu Medical College, Anhui 233030, China.', 'Clinical Laboratories of Bengbu Medical College, Anhui 233030, China.', 'The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.

Here, we characterize the mechanisms initiated upon interruption of treatment. We observed that VPA treatment is followed by a decrease of the B cell counts and proviral loads (copies per blood volume). However, all sheep eventually relapsed after different periods of time and became refractory to further VPA treatment. Sheep remained persistently infected with BLV. B lymphocytes isolated throughout treatment and relapse were responsive to VPA-induced apoptosis in cell culture. B cell proliferation is only marginally affected by VPA ex vivo. Interestingly, in four out of five sheep, ex vivo viral expression was nearly undetectable at the time of relapse. In two sheep, a new tumoral clone arose, most likely revealing a selection process exerted by VPA in vivo. We conclude that the interruption of VPA treatment leads to the resurgence of the leukemia in BLV-infected sheep and hypothesize that resistance to further treatment might be due to the failure of viral expression induction. The development of more potent HDAC inhibitors and/or the combination with other compounds can overcome chemoresistance. These observations in the BLV model may be important for therapies against the related Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1.","['Gillet, Nicolas', 'Vandermeers, Fabian', 'de Brogniez, Alix', 'Florins, Arnaud', 'Nigro, Annamaria', 'Francois, Carole', 'Bouzar, Amel-Baya', 'Verlaeten, Olivier', 'Stern, Eric', 'Lambert, Didier M', 'Wouters, Johan', 'Willems, Luc']","['Gillet N', 'Vandermeers F', 'de Brogniez A', 'Florins A', 'Nigro A', 'Francois C', 'Bouzar AB', 'Verlaeten O', 'Stern E', 'Lambert DM', 'Wouters J', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. n.gillet@ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. fabian.vandermeers@ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. alix.debrogniez@doct.ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. florinsarnaud@hotmail.com.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. annamarianigro@hotmail.it.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. francois-carole@hotmail.com.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. amelbzr@yahoo.com.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. olivier.verlaeten@gmail.com.', 'Pharmaceutic Chemistry and Radiopharmacy Unit, Louvain Drug Research Institute, University of Louvain, Brussels 1000, Belgium. dr.eric.stern@gmail.com.', 'Pharmaceutic Chemistry and Radiopharmacy Unit, Louvain Drug Research Institute, University of Louvain, Brussels 1000, Belgium. didier.lambert@uclouvain.be.', 'Biological Chemistry, Facultes Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix, Namur 5000, Belgium. johan.wouters@fundp.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (GxABT), University of Liege, Liege 4000, Belgium. luc.willems@ulg.ac.be.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121008,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,PMC4235689,,,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['pathogens1020065 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens1020065 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2012 Oct 8;1(2):65-82. doi: 10.3390/pathogens1020065.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These bioactive compounds can cause acute poisoning, and some of them may promote cancer through chronic exposure. Direct ingestion of and contact with contaminated water is one of the many exposure routes to cyanotoxins. The aim of this article was to review the incidence of 13 cancers during a 10-year period in Serbia and to assess whether there is a correlation between the cancer incidences and cyanobacterial bloom occurrence in reservoirs for drinking water supply. The types of cancers were chosen and subjected to epidemiological analyses utilizing previously published data. Based on the epidemiological and statistical analysis, the group of districts in which the incidences of cancers are significant, and may be considered as critical, include Nisavski, Toplicki, and Sumadijski district. A significantly higher incidence of ten cancers was observed in the three critical districts as compared to the remaining 14 districts in Central Serbia. These elevated incidences of cancer include: brain cancer, heart, mediastinum and pleura cancer, ovary cancer, testicular cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, retroperitoneum and peritoneum cancer, leukemia, malignant melanoma of skin, and primary liver cancer. In addition, the mean incidence of five chosen cancers was the highest in the three critical regions, then in the rest of Central Serbia, while the lowest values were recorded in Vojvodina. Persistent and recurrent cyanobacterial blooms occur during summer months in reservoirs supplying water to waterworks in the three critical districts. People in Central Serbia mainly use surface water as water supply (but not all the water bodies are blooming) while in Vojvodina region (control region in this study) only groundwater is used. Among the 14 ""noncritical"" districts, reservoirs used for drinking water supply have been affected by recurrent cyanobacterial blooms in two districts (Rasinski and Zajecarski), but the waterworks in these districts have been performing ozonation for more than 30 years. We propose that the established statistical differences of cancer incidences in Serbia could be related to drinking water quality, which is affected by cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water reservoirs in certain districts. However, more detailed research is needed regarding cyanobacterial secondary metabolites as risk factors in tumor promotion and cancerogenesis in general.","['Svircev, Zorica', 'Drobac, Damjana', 'Tokodi, Nada', 'Luzanin, Zorana', 'Munjas, Ana Marija', 'Nikolin, Branislava', 'Vuleta, Dusan', 'Meriluoto, Jussi']","['Svircev Z', 'Drobac D', 'Tokodi N', 'Luzanin Z', 'Munjas AM', 'Nikolin B', 'Vuleta D', 'Meriluoto J']","['a Department of Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Sciences , University of Novi Sad , Novi Sad , Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Environ Sci Health C Environ Carcinog Ecotoxicol Rev,"Journal of environmental science and health.

We hereby describe what we believe to be the first reported case of t (14; 15) (q32; q13) associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods. PubMed, Embase, and OVID search engines were used to review the related literature and similar published cases. Case. A47-year-old female presented in December 2011 with AML (acute myelomonocytic leukemia) with normal cytogenetics; molecular testing revealed FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, while no mutations involving FLT3 D385/I836, NPM1 exon 12, or KIT exons 8 and 17 were detected. She was induced with 7 + 3 (cytarabine + idarubicin) and achieved complete remission after a second induction with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) followed by uneventful consolidation. She presented 19 months after diagnosis with relapsed disease. Of note, at relapse cytogenetic analysis revealed t (14; 15) (q32; q13), while FLT-3 analysis showed a codon D835 mutation (no ITD mutation was detected). She proved refractory to the initial clofarabine-based regimen, so FLAG-idarubicin then was used. She continued to have persistent disease, and she was discharged on best supportive care. Conclusion.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT) enzymes are implicated in the prevention of DNA damage by ROS. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between CAT C262T, GPX1 Pro198Leu, MnSOD Ala16Val, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms and the risk of CML. No association was observed between CML and variant genotypes of GPX1, MnSOD, GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms in any of the investigated cases. Our study suggests that the homozygous variant genotype of the GSTP1 Ile105Val gene polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of developing CML (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.08-5.7; P value = 0.02), while the heterozygous genotype of the CAT C262T polymorphism seems to have a protective effect against CML (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.39-0.89, P value = 0.01). In most cases, no association was found between laboratory parameters and prognostic factors and the variant genotype of investigated gene polymorphisms. We concluded that CAT, GPX, MnSOD, GSTM1, and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms are not associated with the risk of CML. Variant genotype of the GSTP1 Ile105Val gene polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of developing CML.","['Banescu, Claudia', 'Trifa, Adrian P', 'Voidazan, Septimiu', 'Moldovan, Valeriu G', 'Macarie, Ioan', 'Benedek Lazar, Erzsebeth', 'Dima, Delia', 'Duicu, Carmen', 'Dobreanu, Minodora']","['Banescu C', 'Trifa AP', 'Voidazan S', 'Moldovan VG', 'Macarie I', 'Benedek Lazar E', 'Dima D', 'Duicu C', 'Dobreanu M']","['Department of Medical Genetics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy Tirgu Mures, 38 Gh.

The silencing of DAPK1 can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation, indicating that it may have a role in tumor suppression. DAPK1 activity can be inhibited by the cytosine methylation that occurs in its promoter region. These methylation changes in the promoter region of DAPK1 have been reported in a range of solid and hematological malignancies. In the present study, DAPK1 methylation was investigated in chronic myeloid leukemia patients (n=43) using bisulfite conversion followed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The present study included a number of patients who were identified to be resistant to the common chemotherapeutic agent imatinib (STI571, Gleevec((R)), Glivec((R))), exhibiting at least one mutation in the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) gene. Thus, the patients in the present study were divided into two groups according to their response to imatinib therapy: Non-resistant (n=26) and resistant (n=17) to imatinib. Resistant patients were characterized by the presence of single or multiple mutations of the BCR-ABL gene: i) T315I, ii) M351T, iii) E255K, iv) T315I and M351T or v) T315I, M351T and E255K. The present study identified that: i) The incidence of DAPK1 methylation was significantly higher in the resistant patients compared with the non-resistant patients; ii) the extent of resistance varied between mutation types; and iii) there was no DAPK1 methylation in any of the healthy controls. These findings indicate that DAPK1 methylation may be associated with a signaling pathway for imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Celik, Selcen', 'Akcora, Dilara', 'Ozkan, Tulin', 'Varol, Nuray', 'Aydos, Sena', 'Sunguroglu, Asuman']","['Celik S', 'Akcora D', 'Ozkan T', 'Varol N', 'Aydos S', 'Sunguroglu A']","['Department of Basic Biotechnology, Institute of Biotechnology, Ankara University, Golbasi, Ankara 06830, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, Sihhiye, Ankara 06100, Turkey ; Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Burdur 15100, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Biotechnology, Institute of Biotechnology, Ankara University, Golbasi, Ankara 06830, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, Sihhiye, Ankara 06100, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, Sihhiye, Ankara 06100, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, Sihhiye, Ankara 06100, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141106,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC4246661,['NOTNLM'],"['DAPK1', 'DNA methylation', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib resistance', 'methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction']",2014/12/02 06:00,2014/12/02 06:01,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2014.2677 [doi]', 'ol-09-01-0399 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2015 Jan;9(1):399-404. doi: 10.3892/ol.2014.2677.

The activity of the key enzymes in polyamine catabolism was detected using chemiluminescence. TBP can induce apoptosis and significantly inhibit K562 cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TBP treatment significantly induced the enzyme activity of spermine oxidase and acetylpolyamine oxidase in K562 cells, and also enhanced the inhibitory effect of the antitumor drug doxorubicin on K562 cell proliferation. As a novel polyamine analog, TBP significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in K562 cells by upregulating the activity of the key enzymes in the polyamine catabolic pathways. TBP also increased the sensitivity of the K562 cells to the antitumor drug doxorubicin.

Interphase FISH (iFISH) is a way out here, however, testing many probes at the same time is protracted and expensive. Here multiplex-ligation-dependent-probe-amplification (MLPA) was used retrospectively in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples initially studied by banding cytogenetics and iFISH. Detection rates of iFISH and MLPA were compared and thus a cost-efficient scheme for routine diagnostics is proposed. RESULTS: Banding cytogenetics was done successfully in 67/85 samples. DNA was extracted from all 85 CLL samples. A commercially available MLPA probe set directed against 37 loci prone to be affected in hematological malignancies was applied. Besides, routine iFISH was done by commercially available probes for following regions: 11q22.3, 12p11.2-q11.1, 13q14.3, 13q34, 14q32.33 and 17p13.1. MLPA results were substantiated by iFISH using corresponding locus-specific probes. Aberrations were detected in 67 of 85 samples (~79%) applying banding cytogenetics, iFISH and MLPA. A maximum of 8 aberrations was detected per sample; however, one aberration per sample was found most frequently. Overall 163 aberrations were identified. 15 of those (~9%) were exclusively detected by banding cytogenetics, 95 were found by MLPA (~58%) and 100 (~61%) by routine iFISH. MLPA was not able to distinguish reliably between mono- and biallelic del(13)(q14.3q14.3), which could be easily identified as well as quantified by routine iFISH. Also iFISH was superior to MLPA in samples with low tumor cell load. On the other hand MLPA detected additional aberrations in 22 samples, two of them being without any findings after routine iFISH. CONCLUSIONS: Both MLPA and routine iFISH have comparable detection rates for aberrations being typically present in CLL. As MLPA can detect also rare chromosomal aberrations it should be used as an initial test if routine cytogenetics is not possible or non-informative. Still iFISH should be used additionally to distinguish mono- from biallelic deletions and also to determine rate of mosaicism for 13q14.2 to 13q14.3. In case MLPA is negative the corresponding CLL samples should be tested at least by iFISH using the standard probe set to.","['Alhourani, Eyad', 'Rincic, Martina', 'Othman, Moneeb Ak', 'Pohle, Beate', 'Schlie, Cordula', 'Glaser, Anita', 'Liehr, Thomas']","['Alhourani E', 'Rincic M', 'Othman MA', 'Pohle B', 'Schlie C', 'Glaser A', 'Liehr T']","['Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany ; Croatian Institute of Brain Research, Salata 12, 1000 Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141119,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,PMC4247644,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromosomal aberrations', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)', 'Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)']",2014/12/02 06:00,2014/12/02 06:01,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-014-0079-2 [doi]', '79 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2014 Nov 19;7(1):79. doi: 10.1186/s13039-014-0079-2. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes clinical and laboratory as well as epidemiological features of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma reported betwen 1982 and 1984 in the city of Ibadan, Nigeria. The observed pattern of distribution of childhood haematological malignancies in the city is more consistent with the observations of Ludwik Gross's experiments on environmental influences, such as malnutrition and infections, animal leukaemogenesis, and mirroring the consequences of the primordial pressures that have shaped human genetics and pathophysiology.","['Williams, Christopher Ko', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Luzzatto, Lucio', 'Saliu, Idris', 'Levine, Arthur', 'Greaves, Mel F']","['Williams CK', 'Foroni L', 'Luzzatto L', 'Saliu I', 'Levine A', 'Greaves MF']","['Department of Haematology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria ; Hematology Oncology Consultancy, Port Angeles, WA 98362, USA ; FHCRC/UW Centre for AIDS Research (CFAR), Seattle, WA 98104, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medicine School, London W12 ONN, England.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medicine School, London W12 ONN, England.', 'Department of Haematology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medicine School, London W12 ONN, England ; Viral Epidemiology Branch, Landow Building 3C19, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20205, USA.', 'Chester Beatty Laboratories, London SW3 6JB, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141106,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,PMC4239129,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood leukaemia', 'chloroma', 'environmental factors', 'leukaemogenesis', 'lifestyle', 'lymphoblastic', 'socio-economic']",2014/12/02 06:00,2014/12/02 06:01,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2014.478 [doi]', 'can-8-478 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2014 Nov 6;8:478. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2014.478. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first important clue to its pathogenesis the Philadelphia chromosome created by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t [9; 22] [q34; q11]). The development of the BCR-ABL-targeted imatinib mesylate represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of CML. Imatinib displays inhibitory activity against other kinase(s) that play a role in monocyte/macrophage development. Accordingly many studies revealed the role of cytokines in pathophysiology of myeloid neoplasia including participation of IL-1beta in the pathogenesis of CML. This study designed to assess the behavior of IL-1beta through newly diagnosed patients, different responders groups (optimal, suboptimal and failure cytogenetic response) and advanced stages (acceleration and crisis groups) of CML Iraqi patients whom receiving Imatinib mesylate (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), trying to elucidate the role of immunity in pathophysiology of CML disease development and treatments. In this study 96 Iraqi CML patients under imatinib mesylate treatment categorized by complete blood picture and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis into different response groups and stages, then used an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique to assess serum level of IL-1beta in each response group and advance stage (acceleration and transformed) of CML patients, in comparison to level in 32 healthy control subjects and 32 newly diagnosed CML. Out of 128 patients the mean serum of interleukin 1beta level (pg/ml) for the newly diagnosed, optimal responded, suboptimal responded, failure cytogenetic and advance stage of CML were 6.53 +/- 3.81, 18.47 +/- 4.29, 18.69 +/- 3.03, 5.73 +/- 2.44, and 18.10 +/- 3.10, respectively. While healthy was 12.17 +/- 3.44. The measurement of IL-1beta before and during treatment of CML patients may contribute to the early identification of responder and non responder patients, and help in the earlier choice and/or design of alternative therapeutic strategies.","['Matti, Bassam Francis', 'Saleem, Maysoon Ali', ""Sabir, Shahla'a Fadhil""]","['Matti BF', 'Saleem MA', 'Sabir SF']","['Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Clinical Hematology Department, Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'College of Medicine, Microbiology Department, Al-Mustansiriya University, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'National Center of Hematology, Laboratory Department, Al-Mustansiriya University, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140207,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC4243414,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib mesylate', 'Interleukin-1beta']",2014/12/02 06:00,2014/12/02 06:01,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2013/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-014-0339-7 [doi]', '339 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2014 Dec;30(4):247-52. doi: 10.1007/s12288-014-0339-7.

NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in inflammation and immunity and its activation is an important event for macrophage differentiation both in vivo and in vitro. We report here that NF-kappaB activation is critical for determining ATRA-induced lineage specific differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. Our data revealed that ATRA treatment to HL-60 cells enhanced IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and the activated NF-kappaB potentiated the ability of ATRA for differentiation and switched differentiation to macrophages instead of granulocytes. Serum withdrawal and LPS treatment dampened IkappaBalpha expression via MAPK activation and reactive oxygen species generation leading to NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and ATRA treatment further corroborated these effects in myeloid leukemia cells. Activated NF-kappaB enhanced the degree of ATRA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to macrophages, rather than granulocytes, as assessed by morphologic examination and expressions of differentiation markers such as CD11b, CD38, CD68, MMP9 and Btg2. Employing LLnL or dominant negative IkappaBalpha attenuated NF-kappaB associated enhanced cell maturation and differentiation switch thus suggesting NF-kappaB as one of the factors that determines ATRA induced lineage specificity of myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, MAPK activation was observed to be central both for the differentiation of promyelocytic cells to macrophages or granulocytes regulating NF-kappaB or C/EBPalpha expressions, respectively; however, MAPK-mediated signals are modulated under various conditions affecting lineage specificity. In summary, our present data demonstrate that activation of NF-kappaB directly affects differentiation program of promyelocytes to macrophages, rather than granulocyte, in response to ATRA treatment.","['Imran, Muhammad', 'Park, Joon Seong', 'Lim, In Kyoung']","['Imran M', 'Park JS', 'Lim IK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Molecular Medicine, Ajou University School of Medicine and Graduate School, Suwon 443-380, Republic of Korea; Biochemistry Section, Institute of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar 25120, KP, Pakistan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ajou University School of Medicine and Graduate School, Suwon 443-380, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Molecular Medicine, Ajou University School of Medicine and Graduate School, Suwon 443-380, Republic of Korea.

The efficacy of daunorubicin (DNR) in suppression of leukemic cell survival was investigated in the presence of tautomycin (TM) and calyculin A (CLA), specific membrane permeable inhibitors of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and -2A (PP2A), respectively. CLA (50 nM) or TM (1muM) suppressed viability of THP-1 and KG-1 myeloid leukemia cell lines to moderate extents; however, they significantly increased survival upon DNR-induced cell death. CLA increased the phosphorylation level of Erk1/2 and PKB/Akt kinases, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), decreased caspase-3 activation by DNR and increased the phosphorylation level of the inhibitory sites (Thr696 and Thr853) in the myosin phosphatase (MP) target subunit (MYPT1) as well as in a 25kDa kinase-enhanced phosphatase inhibitor (KEPI)-like protein. TM induced enhanced phosphorylation of pRb only, suggesting that this event may be a common factor upon CLA-induced PP2A and TM-induced PP1 inhibitory influences on cell survival. Silencing PP1 by siRNA in HeLa cells, or overexpression of Flag-KEPI in MCF-7 cells coupled with inducing its phosphorylation by PMA or CLA, resulted in increased phosphorylation of pRb. Our results indicate that PP1 directly dephosphorylates pRb, while PP2A might have an indirect influence via mediating the phosphorylation level of PP1 inhibitory proteins. These data imply the importance of PP1 inhibitory proteins in controlling the phosphorylation state of key proteins and regulating drug sensitivity and apoptosis in leukemic cells.","['Dedinszki, Dora', 'Kiss, Andrea', 'Markasz, Laszlo', 'Marton, Adrienn', 'Toth, Emese', 'Szekely, Laszlo', 'Erdodi, Ferenc']","['Dedinszki D', 'Kiss A', 'Markasz L', 'Marton A', 'Toth E', 'Szekely L', 'Erdodi F']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.

In T-cell ALL (T-ALL), chromosomal rearrangements are identified in up to 70% of the patients while the remaining patients show a normal karyotype. In the present study, a 16-year-old male was diagnosed with T-precursor cell ALL and a normal karyotype after standard GTG-banding, was studied retrospectively (>10 years after diagnosis) in frame of a research project by molecular approaches. In addition to molecular cytogenetics, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and high resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) were also applied. Thus, the following yet unrecognized balanced chromosomal aberrations were detected: der(3)t(3;5)(p23;q31.1), der(5)t(3;5)(p23;q35.3), der(5)t(5;10)(q31.1;p12.3) and der(10)t(5;10)(q35.3;p12.3).

A substitution of aspartate to valine at amino acid 816 (D816V) is one of the most commonly found oncogenic c-Kit mutations and is found in >90% of cases of mastocytosis and less commonly in germ-cell tumors, core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia and mucosal melanomas. The mechanisms by which this mutation leads to constitutive activation and transformation are not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that the D816V mutation causes a structural change in the activation loop (A-loop), resulting in weaker binding of the A-loop to the juxtamembrane domain. In this paper, we have investigated the role of Y823, the only tyrosine residue in the A-loop, and its role in oncogenic transformation by c-Kit/D816V by introducing the Y823F mutation. Although dispensable for the kinase activity of c-Kit/D816V, the presence of Y823 was crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, mutation of Y823 selectively downregulates the Ras/Erk and Akt pathways as well as the phosphorylation of STAT5 and reduces the transforming capacity of the D816V/c-Kit in vitro. We further show that mice injected with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V/Y823F display significantly reduced tumor size as well as tumor weight compared with controls. Finally, microarray analysis, comparing Y823F/D816V cells with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V, demonstrate that mutation of Y823 causes upregulation of proapoptotic genes, whereas genes of survival pathways are downregulated. Thus, phosphorylation of Y823 is not necessary for kinase activation, but essential for the transforming ability of the c-Kit/D816V mutant.","['Agarwal, S', 'Kazi, J U', 'Mohlin, S', 'Pahlman, S', 'Ronnstrand, L']","['Agarwal S', 'Kazi JU', 'Mohlin S', 'Pahlman S', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Translational Cancer Research, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Cancer Research, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Cancer Research, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'CREATE Health, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Cancer Research, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'CREATE Health, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Cancer Research, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141201,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2014/12/02 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014383 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.383 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Aug 27;34(35):4581-90. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.383.

To examine whether the Mdm2(SNP309-)(G) allele contributes to colorectal cancer, we generated cohorts of mice harboring either the G (minor allelic variant) or T (major allelic variant) allele and treated them with azoxymethane (AOM), a carcinogen that induces sporadic colorectal cancer. Mdm2(SNP309-G/G) mice displayed a significant reduction in survival following AOM treatment with more colonic lesions in a wider distribution throughout the lower and upper colon and an attenuated apoptotic response following exposure. AOM did not significantly induce stabilization of wild-type p53 or activate p53 downstream targets following AOM treatment, regardless of the genotype. Instead, Mdm2(SNP309-G/G) colons had significant changes in the expression of genes that regulate Mdm2 transcription (ERalpha and Sp1) as well as downstream targets of Mdm2.

Previous studies have investigated the effects of centipedegrass extract (CGE), which is mainly composed of maysin and its derivatives, and have demonstrated that it has various biological activities, including antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities, pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity, anti-adipogenic activity and insecticidal activity. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the anticancer effects of CGE in ALL cell lines and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects. Cell viability was measured by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue (MTT) assay. Apoptosis, cell cycle progression and mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim) were determined by flow cytometry. The effects of CGE on the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) were assessed by immunoblotting. PI3K, MAPK and caspase inhibitors were used to further confirm the molecular mechanisms involved. Our results clearly demonstrated that the proliferation of the ALL cells was significantly inhibited by CGE in a dosedependent manner. Apoptosis was accompanied by the induction of significant G1 cell cycle arrest. The resulting alteration of the Psim increased the activity of caspase3/7. The induction of apoptosis was enhanced by the combined treatment of CGE with a PI3K inhibitor or an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor, whereas the CGEinduced apoptosis was inhibited in the presence of caspase inhibitors, such as zVADfmk and zIETDfmk. Furthermore, CGE inhibited PI3K activity by decreasing the levels of phosphorylated (p)Akt, pBAD, and Bcl2 together with the levels of MAPKs, including pERK and pJNK, but demonstrated no effects on p38 MAPK. Thus, our data suggest that CGE may be a novel natural compound with potential for use as an antitumor agent in ALL.","['Bai, Hyoung-Woo', 'Badaboina, Srilatha', 'Park, Chul-Hong', 'Choi, Bo Yun', 'Na, Yun Hee', 'Chung, Byung Yeoup']","['Bai HW', 'Badaboina S', 'Park CH', 'Choi BY', 'Na YH', 'Chung BY']","['Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Jeongeupsi, Jeollabukdo 580185, Republic of Korea.', 'Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Jeongeupsi, Jeollabukdo 580185, Republic of Korea.', 'Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Jeongeupsi, Jeollabukdo 580185, Republic of Korea.', 'Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Jeongeupsi, Jeollabukdo 580185, Republic of Korea.', 'Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Jeongeupsi, Jeollabukdo 580185, Republic of Korea.', 'Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (ARTI), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Jeongeupsi, Jeollabukdo 580185, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141126,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,,,,2014/12/02 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2014.2012 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2015 Feb;35(2):511-8. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2014.2012.

For each course, serum samples for NTBI detection were taken prior to chemotherapy, during treatment and during subsequent bone marrow myelosuppression: NTBI was assessed by HPLC. Appearance of NTBI was observed from the start of induction treatment and was still detectable during bone marrow myelosuppression; the recovery of the bone marrow function coincided with the disappearance of NTBI. This kinetic was observed in all subsequent high doses chemotherapy courses, independently from confounding variables such as transfusional iron intake and transferrin saturation. NTBI seems to be a consequence of chemotherapy induced lysis of bone marrow cells and, partly, of hepatocytes after cytotoxic injury. The subsequent persistence of NTBI throughout bone marrow myelosuppression is related to the transient suspension of erythropoietic activity. Moreover, NTBI levels >2muM at the beginning of iatrogenic myelosuppression were associated with higher risk of sepsis caused by Gram negative Bacilli (RR 2.571), also compared with other infectious complications (RR 1.954).","['Belotti, Angelo', 'Duca, Lorena', 'Borin, Lorenza', 'Realini, Silvia', 'Renso, Rossella', 'Parma, Matteo', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Pogliani, Enrico', 'Cappellini, Maria Domenica']","['Belotti A', 'Duca L', 'Borin L', 'Realini S', 'Renso R', 'Parma M', 'Pioltelli P', 'Pogliani E', 'Cappellini MD']","['Department of Haematology, Ospedale San Gerardo, University of Milano Bicocca, Via Pergolesi 33, 20900 Monza, Italy.

To answer this question, we retrospectively reviewed our cytogenetic archives and identified 31 patients with isolated +15. Four patients presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), +15 was the major clone (56-95% of interphases) in BM and the clonal size of +15 was correlated with blast burden and disease status. For the remaining 27 patients, +15 was a minor clone (3-24% of interphases) in BM. Eighteen patients had a history of cytotoxic therapies and developed +15 after a median latency interval of 34 months. Six patients had BM involvement by lymphoma or myeloma, and +15 was exclusively detected in myeloid and erythroid cells, not in lymphoma or myeloma cells. With a median follow-up of 28 months, none of these 27 patients had clinical or morphological evidence of myelodysplastic syndromes. We conclude that +15 can be associated with AML, but more often isolated +15 presents as a minor clone in BM, and may not be disease associated.

The severity of these common adverse effects is directly related to the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) incompatibility. In addition to the key role of classic HLA matching in influencing HSCT outcome, several lines of evidence suggest an important role for nonclassic major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, HLA-E. The interaction of HLA-E with NKG2A, its main receptor on natural killer cells, modulates cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production, an important role in innate immune responses. In addition, the HLA-E molecule can present peptides to different subtypes of T cells that may either support graft-versus-leukemia effects or be involved in bridging innate and acquired immunity. To date, the role of HLA-E and its polymorphisms in HSCT outcomes such as graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related mortality, and improved survival has been published by a number of groups. In addition, these data suggest an association between HLA-E polymorphisms and relapse. Whether the engagement of the HLA-E molecule in the modulation of donor T cells is involved in the graft-versus-leukemia effect, or whether a different mechanism of HLA-E dependent reduction of relapse is involved, requires further investigation.","['Hosseini, Ehteramolsadat', 'Schwarer, Anthony P', 'Ghasemzadeh, Mehran']","['Hosseini E', 'Schwarer AP', 'Ghasemzadeh M']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran; Department of Immunology, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.

The anticancer effect of diosgenin has been reported in various tumor cells, including leukemia, gastric, colorectal, and breast cancer. However, the activity of diosgenin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying mechanism have not been completely investigated. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and associated mechanisms of diosgenin in HCC cells. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the presence of cell cycle arrest and apopotic cells. Diosgenin significantly inhibited the growth of Bel-7402, SMMC-7721 and HepG2 HCC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Diosgenin treatment for 24 h induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of hepatoma cells. Diosgenin inhibited Akt phosphorylation and upregulated p21 and p27 expression, but did not alter the expression of p53, suggesting diosgenin-induced upregulation of p21 and p57 is p53-independent in HCC cells. Diosgenin induced HCC cell apoptosis by activating caspase cascades -3, -8 and -9. However, diosgenin did not affect Bcl-2 and Bax levels. In conclusion, results of the present study suggest that diosgenin may be an active anti-HCC agent obtained from natural plants and provide new insights in understanding the mechanisms of diosgenin.","['Li, Yongjian', 'Wang, Xiaorong', 'Cheng, Silu', 'Du, Juan', 'Deng, Zhengting', 'Zhang, Yani', 'Liu, Qun', 'Gao, Jingdong', 'Cheng, Binbin', 'Ling, Changquan']","['Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Cheng S', 'Du J', 'Deng Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu Q', 'Gao J', 'Cheng B', 'Ling C']","['Department of Oncology, Suzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215009, P.R.

NCR1 (NKp46, CD355) has been considered a pan species NK cell marker and is expressed on most or all NK cells in all species investigated except for the pig which has both a NCR1(+) and a NCR1(-) population. In this study peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 14 healthy dogs, 37 dogs with a clinical diagnosis, including a dog diagnosed with LGL leukemia, and tissue samples from 8 dogs were evaluated for NCR1(+) expression by a cross reacting anti bovine NCR1 antibody. CD3(-)NCR1(+) cells were found in the blood of 93 % of healthy dogs and comprised up to 2.5 % of lymphocytes in PBMC. In a selection of healthy dogs, sampling and immunophenotyping were repeated throughout a period of 1 year revealing a substantial variation in the percentage of CD3(-)NCR1(+) over time. Dogs allocated to 8 disease groups had comparable amounts of CD3(-)NCR1(+) cells in PBMC to the healthy individuals. All organs examined including liver, spleen and lymph nodes contained CD3(-)NCR1(+) cells. Circulating CD3(-)NCR1(+) cells were further characterized as CD56(-)GranzymeB(+)CD8(-). A CD3(+)NCR1(+) population was observed in PBMC in 79 % of the healthy dogs examined representing at the most 4.8 % of the lymphocyte population. In canine samples examined for CD56 expression, CD56(+) cells were all CD3(+) and NCR1(-). To our knowledge, this is the first examination of NCR1 expression in the dog. The study shows that this NK cell associated receptor is expressed both on populations of CD3(+) and CD3(-) blood lymphocytes in dogs and the receptor is found on a CD3(+) GranzymeB(+) CD8(+) leukemia. Our results support that CD56 is expressed only on CD3(+) cells in dogs and shows that NCR1 defines a different CD3(+) lymphocyte population than CD56(+)CD3(+) cells in this species. CD3(-)NCR1(+) cells may represent canine NK cells.","['Grondahl-Rosado, Christine', 'Bonsdorff, Tina B', 'Brun-Hansen, Hege C', 'Storset, Anne K']","['Grondahl-Rosado C', 'Bonsdorff TB', 'Brun-Hansen HC', 'Storset AK']","['Department of Food Safety and Infection Biology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Biosciences, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141202,Netherlands,Vet Res Commun,Veterinary research communications,8100520,,,,2014/12/02 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11259-014-9624-z [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Res Commun. 2015 Mar;39(1):19-30. doi: 10.1007/s11259-014-9624-z.

We report on 1179 patients with a median age of 48 years who were randomized upfront. In the control arm, sibling HCT was scheduled in the first complete remission for intermediate-risk or high-risk AML and matched unrelated HCT in complex karyotype AML. In the experimental arm, matched unrelated HCT in first remission was offered also to patients with an FLT3-ITD (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication) allelic ratio >0.8, poor day +15 marrow blast clearance and adverse karyotypes. Further, allogeneic HCT was recommended in high-risk AML to be performed in aplasia after induction chemotherapy. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, superiority of the experimental transplant strategy could not be shown with respect to overall survival (OS) or event-free survival. As-treated analyses suggest a profound effect of allogeneic HCT on OS (HR 0.73; P=0.002) and event-free survival (HR 0.67; P<0.001). In high-risk patients, OS was significantly improved after allogeneic HCT in aplasia (HR 0.64; P=0.046) and after HCT in remission (HR 0.74; P=0.03). Although superiority of one study arm could not be demonstrated in the ITT analysis, secondary analyses suggest that early allogeneic HCT is a promising strategy for patients with high-risk AML.","['Schetelig, J', 'Schaich, M', 'Schafer-Eckart, K', 'Hanel, M', 'Aulitzky, W E', 'Einsele, H', 'Schmitz, N', 'Rosler, W', 'Stelljes, M', 'Baldus, C D', 'Ho, A D', 'Neubauer, A', 'Serve, H', 'Mayer, J', 'Berdel, W E', 'Mohr, B', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Parmentier, S', 'Rollig, C', 'Kramer, M', 'Platzbecker, U', 'Illmer, T', 'Thiede, C', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Ehninger, G']","['Schetelig J', 'Schaich M', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Hanel M', 'Aulitzky WE', 'Einsele H', 'Schmitz N', 'Rosler W', 'Stelljes M', 'Baldus CD', 'Ho AD', 'Neubauer A', 'Serve H', 'Mayer J', 'Berdel WE', 'Mohr B', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Parmentier S', 'Rollig C', 'Kramer M', 'Platzbecker U', 'Illmer T', 'Thiede C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G']","['1] Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany [2] DKMS, German Bone Marrow Donor Center, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Stadtisches Klinikum Nord, Medizinische Klinik 5, Nurnberg, Germany.', 'Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH, Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Palliativmedizin, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Asklepios Klinik St Georg, Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Stammzelltransplantation, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Medizinische Klinik 5, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik A, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Charite Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Abteilung Innere Medizin V, Hamatologie, Onkologie und Rheumatologie, Universitat Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Kliniken fur Innere Medizin, Hamatologie/Onkologie und Immunologie, Universitatsklinikum Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik II, Klinikum der J.W.

Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the only viral protein that is expressed in all EBV-associated malignant tissues. The N- and C-terminal domains of EBNA1, which are connected by internal glycine/alanine-rich short repeat sequences of various sizes, show sequence divergence across EBV strains isolated from around the world. At least five subtypes have been described, according to the amino acid at residue 487: P-ala, P-thr, V-val, V-pro, and V-leu. Whether the variations of EBNA-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of EBV or simply reflect the geographical distribution of EBV remain to be investigated. Furthermore, the cell effects conferred by EBNA1 subtypes that differ from that of the B95.8 prototype, which belongs to the P-ala subtype, remain to be elucidated. In this study, PCR was amplified with the full-length V-val EBNA1 gene from the CG3 cell line, an EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a Taiwanese chronic myeloid leukemia patient. Plasmids expressing His-tagged EBNA1 fusion proteins in E. coli were constructed and used to raise antibodies in rabbit. The V-val EBNA1 gene was then cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector and successfully expressed in the transfected cultured cells. Expression of V-val EBNA1 rendered 293 cells able to undergo serumindependent cell proliferation, providing them with anti-apoptotic abilities, which are two characteristics of cancer cells. These data suggested that use of EBNA1 originally derived from tumor cells, rather than the more commonly utilized prototype, when investigating the potential role of EBNA1 in the oncogenesis of EBV-associated malignancies, is crucial.","['Chao, Mei', 'Wang, Hsiao-Ning', 'Lu, Yi Jin', 'Chang, Yu-Sun', 'Yu, Jau-Song']","['Chao M', 'Wang HN', 'Lu YJ', 'Chang YS', 'Yu JS']","['Division of Microbiology, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Kwei-Shan, Tao-Yang 333, Taiwan R.O.C.', 'Division of Microbiology, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Kwei-Shan, Tao-Yang 333, Taiwan R.O.C.', 'Division of Microbiology, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Kwei-Shan, Tao-Yang 333, Taiwan R.O.C.', 'Division of Microbiology, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Kwei-Shan, Tao-Yang 333, Taiwan R.O.C.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Kwei-Shan, Tao-Yang 333, Taiwan R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141125,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,,,2014/12/02 06:00,2015/08/12 06:00,['2014/12/02 06:00'],"['2014/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2014.3625 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2015 Feb;33(2):958-66. doi: 10.3892/or.2014.3625.

Erythroderma may also occur in a broad range of reactive and malignant conditions including T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). We report a case initially diagnosed as SS but ultimately diagnosed as T-PLL based upon skin involvement. CASE REPORT: A 70-year-old man was referred by his hematologist for management of SS. Physical examination revealed lymphadenopathies and mild diffuse erythema without infiltration. His WBC count was elevated at 8.3 G/L. A peripheral blood smear showed Sezary-like cells. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed prolymphocytic T-cells staining positively for CD2, CD3, CD4 and CD7. Cytogenetic studies showed chromosomal abnormalities in terms of number and structure with missing chromosomes 6 and13, as well as deletion of chromosome 17. Finally, a diagnosis of T-PLL was made. Pentostatin was initiated pending treatment with alemtuzumab, but the patient's overall condition deteriorated rapidly and he died 10 days later. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of LPLT is based upon a number of factors. In the case presented herein, the clinically atypical nature of the skin lesions prompted the dermatologist to review the diagnosis. The morphology of the circulating T-lymphocytes and their immunologic and phenotypic characteristics finally ruled out the diagnosis of Sezary syndrome, while their association with compatible cytogenetic anomalies enabled a diagnosis of prolymphocytic leukemia to be made instead. CONCLUSION: Prolymphocytic leukemia involves complex differential diagnosis with regard to Sezary syndrome, posing potential pitfalls for hematologists and dermatologists.","['Dessart, P', 'Lemaire, P', 'Le Du, K', 'Sandrini, J', 'Prophette, B', 'Maillard, H']","['Dessart P', 'Lemaire P', 'Le Du K', 'Sandrini J', 'Prophette B', 'Maillard H']","['Service de dermatologie, centre hospitalier, 194, avenue Rubillard, 72000 Le Mans, France.', ""Laboratoire d'hematologie-hemostase, centre hospitalier, 194, avenue Rubillard, 72000 Le Mans, France."", ""Service d'hematologie, centre Jean-Bernard, 9, rue Beauverger, 72000 Le Mans, France."", ""Laboratoire d'anatomopathologie, centre hospitalier, 194, avenue Rubillard, 72000 Le Mans, France."", ""Laboratoire d'anatomopathologie, centre hospitalier, 194, avenue Rubillard, 72000 Le Mans, France."", 'Service de dermatologie, centre hospitalier, 194, avenue Rubillard, 72000 Le Mans, France.

However, patients with leukemia often have weakened immune function, especially more seriously compromised cellular immune response, and appear to be at greater risk for tuberculosis infection during the transplantation process. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with leukemia accompanying active tuberculosis infection. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed records of 7 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with leukemia concomitant with active tuberculosis infection and who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in our hospital from January 2006 to December 2012. RESULTS: Among these 7 patients (4 males and 3 females; median age: 38 years; range: 30-46 years), the mean duration of anti-TB treatment before transplantation was 3 months (range: 2-4.5 months). All patients acquired engraftment, with an implantation rate of 100%. After transplantation, the mean duration of anti-TB treatment was 12 months. All patients had response after receiving anti-TB treatment. One patient died of leukemia relapse 6 months after the transplantation, but no tuberculosis infection-related death was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leukemia concomitant with active tuberculosis infection can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if they receive an effective anti-TB treatment regimen. The anti-TB treatment regimen had no effect against hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and was well-tolerated. All post-transplanted patients experienced no relapse of tuberculosis during the immune-suppression period. The findings in the present investigation deserve further in-depth study.","['Liu, Mingjuan', 'Yang, Caie', 'Liu, Lihui', 'Shi, Bing', 'Hu, Wenqing', 'Ye, Liping', 'Zhang, Yongqing']","['Liu M', 'Yang C', 'Liu L', 'Shi B', 'Hu W', 'Ye L', 'Zhang Y']","[""Department of Hematology, 309 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, 309 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, 309 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, 309 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, 309 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, 309 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, 309 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China (mainland).""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141130,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,PMC4260619,,,2014/12/01 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/12/01 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['891380 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.891380 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2014 Nov 30;20:2484-8. doi: 10.12659/MSM.891380.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antitubercular Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tuberculosis/*complications/drug therapy']",['0 (Antitubercular Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To develop a new myeloablative conditioning regimen incorporating fludarabine (Flu) and cytarabine (Ara-c). SETTING: A tertiary blood disease hospital in Tianjin, China. METHODS: A Bu/Cy preparative regimen was used, modified by Flu 90 mg/m(2) and Ara-c 6 g/m(2) in 57 unselected patients (median age 37 years) with hematological myeloid malignancies. The patients were to receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Thirteen patients had high-risk leukemia, fifty patients had HLA matched sibling donors while seven patients had HLA mismatched sibling donors. Cy was given 50 mg/kg/day for 2 days while Bu was given 3.2 mg/kg/day intravenously for 3 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Post-transplant donor chimerism, relapse tendency and minimal residual disease. RESULTS: Extramedullar toxicity was relatively limited; the incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) within 100 days was 3.5 %. The incidence of grade II-IV, grade III-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD of the evaluable patients were 21.1, 8.8 and 36.4 %, respectively. With a median follow up of 59 (13-96.5) months, TRM and relapse rate (RR) at eight years were 24.1 +/- 5.8 and 14.7 +/- 4.8 %, respectively. Disease free survival at eight years was 67.9 +/- 6.2 % for the entire group, 60.0 +/- 8.9 % for patients with AML, 77.3 +/- 8.9 % for patients with CML, 70.0 +/- 6.5 and 42.9 +/- 18.7 % or matched sibling and mismatched sibling HSCT respectively. CONCLUSION: The new regimen was associated with a low relapse rate, low incidence and severity of graft versus host disease and satisfactory survival for patients with myeloid malignancies.","['Cai, Xiaojin', 'Wei, Jialing', 'He, Yi', 'Yang, Dongling', 'Jiang, Erlie', 'Huang, Yong', 'Han, Mingzhe', 'Feng, Sizhou']","['Cai X', 'Wei J', 'He Y', 'Yang D', 'Jiang E', 'Huang Y', 'Han M', 'Feng S']","['Center of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Blood Disease Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Peking Union College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141129,Netherlands,Int J Clin Pharm,International journal of clinical pharmacy,101554912,,,,2014/11/30 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/11/30 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11096-014-0036-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharm. 2015 Feb;37(1):44-52. doi: 10.1007/s11096-014-0036-5.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of two consecutive Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG) ALL trials (1995-2004) with a focus on late relapse, which was divided into two categories: late relapse (6-24 months from the end of therapy, n = 48) and very late relapse (>24 months from the end of therapy, n = 57). Forty-three patients (29 late relapse and 14 very late relapse) received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at second remission. The event-free survival (EFS) probabilities of late relapse and very late relapse were 54.5 +/- 7.3 and 64.8 +/- 6.8 % at 7 years, respectively (P = 0.36), and were not significantly different. However, the second relapse incidence of late relapse (34.7 +/- 7.1 %) was higher than that of very late relapse (15.5 +/- 5.1 %, P = 0.03). The second relapse risk was low for very late relapse ALL, which suggests that these patients should be treated without allogeneic HSCT.","['Kato, Motohiro', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Saito, Akiko M', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Ogawa, Chitose', 'Goto, Hiroyuki', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro', 'Ohara, Akira']","['Kato M', 'Manabe A', 'Saito AM', 'Koh K', 'Inukai T', 'Ogawa C', 'Goto H', 'Tsuchida M', 'Ohara A']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan, katom-tky@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141129,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,,2014/11/30 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/11/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1710-z [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jan;101(1):52-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1710-z.

Infrequently, patients with a monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis clinically resembling classic B-CLL have been found to harbor leukemic B cells lacking expression of the CD5 antigen. Little information is available concerning such CLL-like lymphoproliferative syndromes. Here, we provide phenotypic and clinical characteristics of 13 patients with CD5-negative chronic lymphoproliferative disorders selected from among 400 B-CLL patients followed up at a single academic center. Phenotypic analysis was carried out by flow cytometry using a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies including activation, costimulatory, adhesion, and growth factor receptor molecules. Moreover, intracellular staining and stimulation experiments were performed to investigate whether CD5 antigen was either retained in the cytoplasm of clonal B cells or not expressed due to defective cellular activation, respectively. Overall, CD5-negative leukemic cells were found to express significantly different levels of several membrane molecules, including CD95, CD69, CD23, CD25, CD80, and CD20, compared to ""classic"" CLL B cells. CD5 antigen was not detected in the cytoplasm of CD5-negative clonal B cells, nor could it be induced following in vitro activation. CD3+ T cell proportions were found to be less affected in CD5-negative patients than in classic B-CLL. Although these data suggest that CD5-negative clonal B cells are phenotypically different from classic B-CLL, clinical outcomes were similar to those shown by B-CLL patients, with most of the patients experiencing a long-lasting disease requiring chemotherapeutic intervention at some time during the disease course.","['Romano, Ciro', 'Sellitto, Ausilia', 'Chiurazzi, Federico', 'Simeone, Luigia', 'De Fanis, Umberto', 'Raia, Maddalena', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi', 'Lucivero, Giacomo']","['Romano C', 'Sellitto A', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Simeone L', 'De Fanis U', 'Raia M', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Lucivero G']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Second University of Naples Polyclinic Hospital, Piazza Miraglia, 3, 80138, Naples, Italy, ciro.romano@unina2.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141129,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,,2014/11/30 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/11/30 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1703-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jan;101(1):67-74. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1703-y.

The extract in a concentration of 100 mug/ml induced the appearance of cells with a subdiploid DNA content (sub-G1 phase cells), which indicated induction of apoptosis. The antiproliferative effect of Hippophae rhamnoides L. extract on acute myeloid leukemia cells was at least partially determined by activation of the S phase checkpoint, which probably led to deceleration of the cell cycle and apoptosis induction.","['Zhamanbaeva, G T', 'Murzakhmetova, M K', 'Tuleukhanov, S T', 'Danilenko, M P']","['Zhamanbaeva GT', 'Murzakhmetova MK', 'Tuleukhanov ST', 'Danilenko MP']","['Department of Biophysics and Biomedicine, Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty, Kazakhstan, gulzhan_t.82@mail.ru.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141130,United States,Bull Exp Biol Med,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,0372557,,,,2014/11/30 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2014/11/30 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10517-014-2734-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Exp Biol Med. 2014 Dec;158(2):252-5. doi: 10.1007/s10517-014-2734-3.

METHODS: Gene expression profile GSE28460 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, including 49 diagnostic and relapse bone marrow samples with childhood B-precursor ALL. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by paired t-test. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs and transcription factors (TFs) enrichment analysis were performed, followed by construction of co-expressed, DEGs, and susceptibility gene protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Based on these three networks, relevant regulatory network modules and the important DEGs in the modules were identified. RESULTS: Total of 947 DEGs were identified. Up-regulated DEGs enriched 20 pathways including cell cycle, and down-regulated DEGs significantly enriched Jak-STAT signaling pathways. CDK1 and BRCA1 were found to have more hubs in both co-expressed network and PPI network. Besides, total of five modules in INTS10, MCM, BRCA1, GYPA, and VCAN1 families were identified and a pathway of INTS10-INTS6-POLR2A-MAGI2 was selected. CONCLUSION: Cell cycle and Jak-STAT signaling pathway were closely associated with relapse of childhood B-precursor ALL. The DEGs, such as PTTG1, PIK3CA, CDK1, and BRCA1 may be the potential targets for childhood ALL diagnosis and treatment.","['Li, Jun', 'Zhai, Xiaowen', 'Wang, Hongsheng', 'Qian, Xiaowen', 'Miao, Hui', 'Zhu, Xiaohua']","['Li J', 'Zhai X', 'Wang H', 'Qian X', 'Miao H', 'Zhu X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141128,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Bioinformatics analysis', 'Molecular mechanism', 'Network module']",2014/11/29 06:00,2016/04/28 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000214 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Aug;20(7):377-83. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000214.

Tumor recognition by NK cells was found to be partly triggered by molecules termed natural cytotoxic receptors (NCRs). Adoptive transfer of genetically-engineered tumor-reactive T-lymphocytes can mediate remarkable tumor regressions mostly in melanoma and leukemia patients. Yet, the application of such treatments to other cancers is needed and dependent on the isolation of receptors that could facilitate efficient recognition of these malignancies. Herein, we aimed at combining NK tumor recognition capability with the genetic modification of T-cells to provide the latter with a means to recognize several tumors in a non-MHC restricted way. Consequently, we generated and evaluated several chimeric receptors based on the extracellular domain of NCR1 (NKp46) fused to multiple signaling moieties and assess their antitumor activity when retrovirally expressed in T-cells. Following co-culture with different tumors, primary human T-lymphocytes expressing a chimeric NCR1 molecule recognized target cells derived from lung, cervical carcinoma, leukemia and pancreatic cancer. In addition, this receptor mediated an upregulation of surface activation markers and significant antitumor cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. These results have meaningful implications for the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer using gene-modified T-cells.","['Tal, Yair', 'Yaakobi, Shlomo', 'Horovitz-Fried, Miryam', 'Safyon, Einav', 'Rosental, Benyamin', 'Porgador, Angel', 'Cohen, Cyrille J']","['Tal Y', 'Yaakobi S', 'Horovitz-Fried M', 'Safyon E', 'Rosental B', 'Porgador A', 'Cohen CJ']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, The Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan 52900 Israel.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, The Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan 52900, Israel.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, The Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan 52900, Israel.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, The Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan 52900, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, and the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, and the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, The Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan 52900, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC4279421,,,2014/11/29 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1919 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.1919 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Nov 15;5(21):10949-58. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.1919.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NGFR protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-positive patients respond well to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. Resistance to imatinib in HES/CEL has been described mainly due to the T674I mutation in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, which is homologous to the imatinib-resistant T315I mutation in BCR-ABL. Development of novel TKIs is imperative to overcome resistance to imatinib. We synthesized S116836, a novel TKI. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of S116836 in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-expressing cells. The results showed that S116836 potently inhibited PDGFRalpha and its downstream signaling molecules such as STAT3, AKT, and Erk1/2. S116836 effectively inhibited the growth of the WT and T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-expressing neoplastic cells in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts. Moreover, S116836 induced intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as well as the death receptor pathway, coincided with up-regulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim-EL through the Erk1/2 pathway.

PATIENT AND METHODS: We evaluated the prognosis of iAMP21 among patients from the ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) 2000 trial with 46 of 2 637 (2%) patients iAMP21+. RESULTS: 8-year event-free-survival (EFS, 64 +/- 8% vs. 81 +/- 1%, p=0.0026) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 29 +/- 8% vs. 14 +/- 1%, p=0.008) of the iAMP21 cases were significantly worse compared with non-iAMP21 patients. Within the MRD low-risk group, iAMP21 cases (n=14) had an inferior 8-year EFS (76 +/- 12% vs. 92 +/- 1%, p=0.0081), but no increased CIR (10 +/- 10% vs. 6 +/- 1%, p=0.624). Within the MRD intermediate-risk group, iAMP21 cases (n=27) had a worse 8-year EFS (56 +/- 11% vs. 78 +/- 2%, p=0.0077) and CIR (44 +/- 11% vs. 20 +/- 2%, p=0.003) with 6/10 relapses occurring after 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, we believe that there is no necessity for enrolling all iAMP21 patients into the high-risk arm of ongoing ALL-BFM trials because MRD low-risk patients have a moderate relapse risk under current therapy. Whether the increased relapse risk in MRD intermediate-risk patients can be avoided by late treatment intensification remains to be answered by the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 trial randomly using protracted pegylated L-asparaginase during delayed intensification and early maintenance.","['Attarbaschi, A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, R', 'Mann, G', 'Moricke, A', 'Konig, M', 'Mecklenbrauker, A', 'Teigler-Schlegel, A', 'Bradtke, J', 'Harbott, J', 'Gohring, G', 'Stanulla, M', 'Schrappe, M', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Haas, O A']","['Attarbaschi A', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Mann G', 'Moricke A', 'Konig M', 'Mecklenbrauker A', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Bradtke J', 'Harbott J', 'Gohring G', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Haas OA']","[""Department of pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Oncogenetic Laboratory, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Oncogenetic Laboratory, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Medical School of Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School of Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School of Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141128,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,,,2014/11/29 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0034-1387795 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2014 Nov;226(6-7):338-43. doi: 10.1055/s-0034-1387795.

However, the findings might be group-specific. METHOD: Patient characteristics, actual therapy given and long-term course of the disease in 155 pediatric patients (including non-randomized) with first relapse and 10 primary nonresponders treated in Germany were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall 4-year survival rates after relapse were similar in the 2 treatment groups L-DNR/FLAG and FLAG (0.43 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.06, p(log-rank)=0.47). The rate of randomization was low (65%) and 5% of the 101 randomized patients changed the treatment arm. Therefore, induction was based in 40% patients on an individual decision with preference for L-DNR/FLAG. There were less patients with favorable cytogenetics and morphology in the L-DNR/FLAG-group (p<0.04). Response to the first re-induction course at day 28 tended to be more unfavorable with FLAG only. In this patient group protocol intensifications were more frequent as compared to the L-DNR/FLAG-group (p=0.07), and late CR could be achieved after intensification in 9/18 poor responding patients. CONCLUSION: The initial selection bias of relapse patients with unfavorable risk factors to the disadvantage of the L-DNR/FLAG-group and the more drug- and time-intensive treatment after 1(st) re-induction given in the FLAG-group may have nullified the initial beneficial effect of L-DNR containing re-induction therapy and led to similar and relatively favorable survival rates in both treatment groups in Germany.","['Creutzig, U', 'Semmler, J', 'Kaspers, G L', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Zimmermann, M']","['Creutzig U', 'Semmler J', 'Kaspers GL', 'Reinhardt D', 'Zimmermann M']","[""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."", 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20141128,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,,,2014/11/29 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0034-1385918 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2014 Nov;226(6-7):323-31. doi: 10.1055/s-0034-1385918.

The chronic renal infections that we routinely encounter encompass chronic pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, and eosinophilic cystitis. Patients with diabetes, malignancy and leukaemia are frequently immunocompromised and more prone to fungal infections viz. angioinvasive aspergillus, candida and mucor. Tuberculosis and parasitic infestation of the kidney is common in tropical countries. Imaging is not routinely indicated in uncomplicated renal infections as clinical findings and laboratory data are generally sufficient for making a diagnosis. However, imaging plays a crucial role under specific situations like immunocompromised patients, treatment non-responders, equivocal clinical diagnosis, congenital anomaly evaluation, transplant imaging and for evaluating extent of disease. We aim to review in this article the varied imaging spectrum of renal inflammatory lesions.","['Das, Chandan J', 'Ahmad, Zohra', 'Sharma, Sanjay', 'Gupta, Arun K']","['Das CJ', 'Ahmad Z', 'Sharma S', 'Gupta AK']","['Chandan J Das, Zohra Ahmad, Sanjay Sharma, Arun K Gupta, Department of Radiodiagnosis, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi 110029, India.', 'Chandan J Das, Zohra Ahmad, Sanjay Sharma, Arun K Gupta, Department of Radiodiagnosis, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi 110029, India.', 'Chandan J Das, Zohra Ahmad, Sanjay Sharma, Arun K Gupta, Department of Radiodiagnosis, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi 110029, India.', 'Chandan J Das, Zohra Ahmad, Sanjay Sharma, Arun K Gupta, Department of Radiodiagnosis, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,World J Radiol,World journal of radiology,101538184,PMC4241493,['NOTNLM'],"['Cystitis', 'Imaging modalities', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Pyonephrosis', 'Renal infection', 'Xanthogranulomatous']",2014/11/29 06:00,2014/11/29 06:01,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4329/wjr.v6.i11.865 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Radiol. 2014 Nov 28;6(11):865-73. doi: 10.4329/wjr.v6.i11.865.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the pronounced predominance of concomitant myeloid neoplasms, the much more unusual coexistence of lymphoproliferative diseases has also been reported. Imatinib mesylate (IM) has a role in the treatment of SM in the absence of the KITD816V mutation. In the setting of SM-AHNMD, eradicating the nonmast cell malignant clone greatly affects prognosis. We report a case of an adult patient with SM associated with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

However, the clinical applications of the agent to treat solid tumors are largely compromised by the drug resistance. Our previous study demonstrated that resveratrol, a plant-derived natural product, could potentiate the toxicity of arsenite in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells at relatively high concentration, indicating that combination of resveratrol and As2O3 may be a helpful strategy to solve the drug resistance of As2O3 in tumor cells. To test this possibility, in the present study, we determined the combined effects of resveratrol and As2O3 in cultured A549 cells. Our results showed that co-treatment of resveratrol with As2O3 resulted in a synergistic augmentation of cytotoxicity and apoptosis in cells at the tested concentration. To further reveal the detailed mechanism of this synergistic effect on cytotoxicity and apoptosis, apoptosis-related proteins, DNA and chromosomal damage, and the level of oxidative stress were also evaluated. Our data revealed that co-treatment with resveratrol and As2O3 caused more genotoxicity and serious oxidative stress in A549 cells than that of single agent treatment. Moreover, resveratrol and As2O3 could also corporately enhance the release of cytochrome c and the expressions of death receptor Fas and FasL. Together, our results suggest that resveratrol and As2O3 synergistically increase the apoptotic cell death in A549 cells through induction of oxidative stress, indicating that the combination of resveratrol with As2O3 may be a promising strategy to increase the clinical efficacy of As2O3 in the treatment of lung tumor.","['Gu, Shiyan', 'Chen, Chengzhi', 'Jiang, Xuejun', 'Zhang, Zunzhen']","['Gu S', 'Chen C', 'Jiang X', 'Zhang Z']","[""Department of Environmental Health, West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, No. 16, Section 3, Renmin Nan Road, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141129,United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,,,,2014/11/29 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12011-014-0186-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2015 Feb;163(1-2):112-23. doi: 10.1007/s12011-014-0186-2.

However, the anti-leukemic activities of N. chinensis have not been well examined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of N. chinensis on differentiation and proliferation in the human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried roots and stems of N. chiensis are extracted using hot water and then freeze-dried. The yield of extract was 12.82% (w/w). The HL-60 cells were treated with 25-200 mug/ml of N. chinensis for 72 h or 100 mug/ml of N. chinensis for 24-72 h. RESULTS: Nardostachys chinensis significantly inhibited cell viability dose dependently with an IC50 of 100 mug/ml in HL-60 cells. Nardostachys chinensis induced differentiation of the cells as measured by reduction activity of NBT and expression of CD11b but not of CD14 as analyzed by flow cytometry, which indicates a differentiation toward the granulocytic lineage. Nardostachys chinensis also induced growth inhibition through G0/G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle of HL-60 cells. Among the G0/G1 phase in the cell cycle-related protein, the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27(Kip1) was increased in N. chinensis-treated HL-60 cells, whereas the expression levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E, and cyclin A were decreased. Interestingly, N. chinensis markedly enhanced the binding of p27(Kip1) with CDK2 and CDK6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that N. chinensis is capable of inducing cellular differentiation and growth inhibition through p27(Kip1) protein-related G0/G1 phase arrest in HL-60 cells.","['Ju, Sung-Min', 'Lee, Jun', 'Kang, Jun-Gue', 'Jeong, Sun-Oh', 'Park, Jang-Ho', 'Pae, Hyun-Ock', 'Lee, Guem-San', 'Kim, Won-Sin', 'Lyu, Yeoung-Su', 'Jeon, Byung-Hun']","['Ju SM', 'Lee J', 'Kang JG', 'Jeong SO', 'Park JH', 'Pae HO', 'Lee GS', 'Kim WS', 'Lyu YS', 'Jeon BH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University , Iksan, Jeonbuk , Republic of Korea .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141128,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-leukemic effect', 'HL-60 cells', 'cell-cycle arrest', 'nardosinone']",2014/11/29 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2014.952834 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2015 Jul;53(7):1002-9. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2014.952834.

Establishment of Novel 8-Color Flow Cytometry Approach.,,10.1002/cytob.21210 [doi],"Backround: Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection is an essential tool for therapy response assessment in a considerable number of hematooncologic disorders including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Flow cytometry (FCM) ranks among the most effective approaches which allow rapid sample processing and compete successfully with highly sensitive molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Since FCM is ordinarily applied to detect MRD in B-lineage diseases like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a similar method could be used in MCL. We decided to test our novel 8-color FCM approach in MCL MRD detection. Methods: Employing an 8-color FCM protocol designed by us, the expression of 24 selected surface antigens in a cohort of 30 patients with newly diagnosed leukemic MCL and 20 normal controls were compared to one another to establish markers that can reliably distinguish normal B lymphocytes from the MCL population. The sensitivity of the designed protocol was tested using serial dilution studies. Results: Although MCL presents high immunophenotypic variability the combination of CD20/23/5/19/200/62L/3/45 appears to be very favorable in flow cytometric MRD measurement. Conclusions: Our 8-color FCM protocol could easily detect MRD in MCL patients and reaches a sensitivity of up to 2x10(-4) . This article is protected by copyright.

A systematic review.,149-60,10.1111/ctr.12495 [doi],"Fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplications (ITDs) has been used as a powerful adverse prognostic indicator for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in any age group. Evidence is mixed regarding the effects of allogeneic transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR) for patients with FLT3/ITD AML. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with FLT3/ITD AML receiving HSCT. A search of PubMed, Embase, and OVID yielded 1706 abstracts, two researchers screening the trials based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessed the methodology quality independently. Meta-analysis showed that compared with chemotherapy, both allo-HSCT and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) can reduce the relapse rate (p < 0.01) and improve both the OS (p < 0.01) and DFS (p < 0.01). But when compared allo-HSCT with auto-HSCT, the OS (p = 0.27) and DFS (p = 0.19) have no statistical significance, and only the relapse indicator has statistical significance, p < 0.01. Based on the results, we can conclude that allo-HSCT is an efficient therapy approach for patients with FLT3/ITD AML. Chemotherapy cannot change the poor prognosis. Auto-HSCT can improve OS and DFS, but it cannot reduce the relapse rate.","['Ma, Yingying', 'Wu, Yazhou', 'Shen, Zhaohua', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Zeng, Dongfeng', 'Kong, Peiyan']","['Ma Y', 'Wu Y', 'Shen Z', 'Zhang X', 'Zeng D', 'Kong P']","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, ChongQing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20150102,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3/ITD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic transplantation', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'meta-analysis']",2014/11/29 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ctr.12495 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2015 Feb;29(2):149-60. doi: 10.1111/ctr.12495.

The direct medical costs were calculated from healthcare claims obtained from the Seoul National University Hospital, and the direct non-medical and the indirect costs were calculated from national statistics. The mean direct medical cost was $55,039, direct non-medical cost was $6394, and indirect cost was $7503 from transplantation to one yr after transplantation in the RIC group and $72,916, $6993, and $9057 in the MAC group, respectively, based on the exchange rate of Korean won 1060 = US$1.

This study aimed to examine the changes in SO2, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with Gram-negative bacterial inflammation. METHODS: Fifty-five ALL children were enrolled in this study, including 30 males and 25 females, aged 3-13 years, and the median age was 7.8 years. All these children who accepted chemotherapy for ALL were divided into the control group (before chemotherapy), the infection group (after chemotherapy with infection), and the recovery group (the infection was controlled after 1 week). The serum level of SO2 was detected using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence assay, and NF-kappaB and IL-8 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human THP-1 cells were cultured, induced, and differentiated into macrophages, which were divided into five groups and each group was cultured with different stimulators: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, LPS+L-aspartate-beta-hydroxamate (HDX) group, LPS+SO2 group, SO2, and control groups. NF-kappaB level and IL-8 protein contents by ELISA were examined in each group. RESULTS: In comparison with those of the control group, levels of serum SO2, NF-kappaB, and IL-8 of the infection group were significantly increased (P < 0.05), while those of the recovery group were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was found between levels of serum SO2 and intracellular NF-kappaB/IL-8, and the correlation coefficients were 0.671 and 0.798 (P < 0.05), respectively. According to the results found in human THP-1 cells, levels of NF-kappaB and IL-8 in LPS group were significantly increased compared with those of the control group (P < 0.05); when compared with those in LPS group, levels of NF-kappaB in LPS+HDX group further increased significantly (P < 0.05); however, the NF-kappaB levels of LPS+SO2 group decreased significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SO2 may play an anti-inflammatory role during the process of inflammation by inhibiting the activation and transcription of NF-kappaB.","['Wu, Wanshui', 'Jia, Yongrui', 'Du, Shuxu', 'Tang, Hong', 'Sun, Yangling', 'Sun, Liming']","['Wu W', 'Jia Y', 'Du S', 'Tang H', 'Sun Y', 'Sun L']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Health Science Center, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.

But traditional manual ALIP recognition has many shortcomings such as prone to false alarms, neglect of distribution law before three immature precursor cells gathered, and qualitative analysis instead of quantitative one. So, it is very important to develop a novel automatic method to identify and localize immature precursor cells for computer-aided diagnosis, to disclose their patterns before ALIP with the development of AML. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (1) After preprocessing the image with Otsu method, we identify both precursor cells and trabecular bone by multiple morphological operations and thresholds. (2) We localize the precursors in different regions according to their distances with the nearest trabecular bone based on chamfer distance transform, followed by discussion for the presumptions and limitations of our method. The accuracy of recognition and localization is evaluated based on a comparison with visual evaluation by two blinded observers.","['Cao, Guitao', 'Li, Ling', 'Chen, Weiting', 'Yu, Yehua', 'Shi, Jun', 'Zhang, Guixu', 'Liu, Xuehua']","['Cao G', 'Li L', 'Chen W', 'Yu Y', 'Shi J', 'Zhang G', 'Liu X']","['Software Engineering Institute, East China Normal University, 3663 North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China, gtcao@sei.ecnu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141128,United States,Med Biol Eng Comput,Medical & biological engineering & computing,7704869,,,,2014/11/29 06:00,2015/09/15 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11517-014-1223-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Biol Eng Comput. 2015 Mar;53(3):215-26. doi: 10.1007/s11517-014-1223-1.

Early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) is a subtype of T-ALL with poor prognosis. Although the genetic landscape of ETP-ALL has been determined, genetic alterations related to the relapse of ETP-ALL have not been fully investigated. Here, we report the first patient with relapsed pediatric ETP-ALL to exhibit a homozygous JAK3 activating mutation, V674A, caused by acquired uniparental disomy (UPD). Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis revealed acquired UPD (aUPD) at the 19p13.3-p12 locus only in leukemic cells at relapse. Sanger sequence of the JAK3 gene, which was located at 19p13.1 and frequently mutated in ETP-ALL, was performed in paired leukemic samples to determine homozygous JAK3 V674A mutation only in relapsed leukemic cells. In contrast, leukemic cells at initial diagnosis harbored hemizygous JAK3 V674A mutation. Further, whole-exome sequencing revealed mutations in 18 genes only in relapsed samples, although none of these was recurrent in T-ALL. These findings suggest that aUPD at 19p13.1 is partly associated with relapse in this patient.

HSCT, particularly with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation conditioning, is known to cause secondary premature ovarian failure, resulting in infertility. To preserve post-transplant fertility, several methods have been proposed, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) with embryo cryopreservation.

We evaluated use of the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for the diagnosis of systemic disease in paediatric mastocytosis. In addition, we identified unique clinico-histopathological features within the biopsies. One hundred and thirteen children with paediatric mastocytosis were evaluated at the National Institutes of Health between 1986 and 2013. Complete bone marrow evaluations were performed in 50 cases. Seven children had repeat procedures. Bone marrows were analysed by histopathology, flow cytometry and for KIT D816V. Bone marrow biopsies displayed mild atypical haematopoietic maturation, increased haematogones and hypocellularity in a sub-set of patients with urticaria pigmentosa, diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis and indolent systemic mastocytosis. Hypocellularity was most pronounced in those with urticaria pigmentosa. Haematogones were highest, on average, in patients with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis or mastocytomas. There was no evidence of peripheral blood cytopenias, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm or leukaemia within this cohort. The WHO criteria are applicable for the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis in paediatrics. Although unsuspected bone marrow findings typically seen in myeloproliferative disorders are frequent in paediatric mastocytosis, patients within this study remained clinically stable without progression to a more aggressive variant.","['Carter, Melody C', 'Metcalfe, Dean D', 'Clark, Alicia S', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Maric, Irina']","['Carter MC', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Clark AS', 'Wayne AS', 'Maric I']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20141128,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow', 'childhood', 'mastocytosis', 'myeloproliferative', 'paediatrics']",2014/11/29 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/11/29 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13231 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Mar;168(6):865-73. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13231.

The ethno-medicinal uses of other species have been established, however, scientific validation of this species has not yet been done and as such this paper is aimed at identifying the anti-cancer activity of V divaricata against leukaemia, breast and prostate cancer cell lines. METHODS: Leaves and stems of V divaricata were dried and milled into powder. The crude hexane and methanol extracts of the leaves and stems were obtained and bio-assayed using WST-1 cell proliferation assay against leukaemia, breast and prostate cancer cell lines. RESULTS: The crude hexane and methanol extracts of V divaricata were able to significantly retard the growth of the MCF-7 (breast), HL-60 (leukaemia) and the PC-3 (prostate) cancer cell lines. The crude methanol extract of the stem was the strongest, exhibiting anti-proliferation activity with IC50 values of 10.14, 12.63 and 9.894 microg/ml for the HL-60, MCF-7 and PC-3 cancer cell lines, respectively, with the most potent toward prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: The medicinal use of V divaricata as an anti-cancer agent was corroborated as the crude hexane and methanol extracts demonstrated potent anti-proliferation activity and as such hold potential for further research and development into a drug to prevent or treat various cancers.","['Lowe, H I-C', 'Daley-Beckford, D', 'Toyang, N J', 'Watson, C', 'Hartley, S', 'Bryant, J']","['Lowe HI', 'Daley-Beckford D', 'Toyang NJ', 'Watson C', 'Hartley S', 'Bryant J']","['Bio-Tech R&D Institute, Kingston, Jamaica; Educational and Scientific Corporation, Wellington, Florida, USA. lowebiotech@gmail.com, henrylowe@cwjamaica.com.', 'Bio-Tech R&D Institute, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'Educational and Scientific Corporation, Wellington, Florida, USA; Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Bio-Tech R&D Institute, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'Bio-Tech R&D Institute, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140721,Jamaica,West Indian Med J,The West Indian medical journal,0417410,PMC4663936,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2014/11/28 06:01,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7727/wimj.2013.232 [doi]'],ppublish,West Indian Med J. 2014 Aug;63(4):285-8. doi: 10.7727/wimj.2013.232.

We show here that A-MLV is internalized not by caveolae or other pinocytic mechanisms but by macropinocytosis. Thus, A-MLV infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for caveolin or dynamin, and NIH 3T3 cells knocked down for caveolin expression, was unaffected. Conversely, A-MLV infection of NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells was sensitive to amiloride analogues and actin-depolymerizing drugs that interfere with macropinocytosis. Further manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton through conditional expression of dominant positive or negative mutants of Rac1, PAK1, and RhoG, to increase or decrease macropinocytosis, similarly correlated with an augmented or inhibited infection with A-MLV, respectively. The same experimental perturbations affected the infection of viruses that use clathrin-coated-pit endocytosis or other pathways for entry only mildly or not at all. These data agree with immunofluorescence studies and cryo-immunogold labeling for electron microscopy, which demonstrate the presence of A-MLV in protrusion-rich areas of the cell surface and in cortical fluid phase (dextran)-filled macropinosomes, which also account for up to a half of the cellular uptake of the cell surface-binding lectin concanavalin A. We conclude that A-MLV use macropinocytosis as the predominant entry portal into cells. IMPORTANCE: Binding and entry of virus particles into mammalian cells are the first steps of infection. Understanding how pathogens and toxins exploit or divert endocytosis pathways has advanced our understanding of membrane trafficking pathways, which benefits development of new therapeutic schemes and methods of drug delivery. We show here that amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) pseudotyped with the amphotropic envelope protein (which expands the host range to many mammalian cells) gains entry into host cells by macropinocytosis. Macropinosomes form as large, fluid-filled vacuoles (up to 10 mum) following the collapse of cell surface protrusions and membrane scission. We used drugs or the introduction of mutant proteins that affect the actin cytoskeleton and cell surface dynamics to show that macropinocytosis and A-MLV infection are correlated, and we provide both light- and electron-microscopic evidence to show the localization of A-MLV in macropinosomes. Finally, we specifically exclude some other potential entry portals, including caveolae, previously suggested to internalize A-MLV.","['Rasmussen, Izabela', 'Vilhardt, Frederik']","['Rasmussen I', 'Vilhardt F']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark vilhardt@sund.ku.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141126,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC4300753,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02343-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02343-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Feb;89(3):1851-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02343-14.

BAALC transcript level in AML patients was significantly up-regulated compared with normal controls (P < 0.001). Patients with high BAALC expression had significantly older age than those with low BAALC expression (P = 0.021). The percentage of blasts in bone marrow of the BAALC high-expressed patients was significantly higher than that in the low-expressed patients (P < 0.001). The incidence of BAALC overexpression was significantly higher in M0/M1 (8/9, 89 %) and M2 subtypes (33/48, 68 %) than in M3 subtype (6/27, 22 %) (P < 0.001).

Pax5 expression is essential in B-cell precursors for normal differentiation and maturation of B-cells. On the other hand, it inhibits the differentiation and progress toward other lineages. The expression of this factor is involved in several aspects of B-cell differentiation, including commitment, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, BCR signal transduction and B-cell survival, so that the deletion or inactivating mutations of Pax5 cause cell arrest in Pro-B-cell stage. In recent years, point mutations, deletions and various rearrangements in Pax5 gene have been reported in several types of human cancers. However, no clear relationship has been found between these aberrations and disease prognosis. Specific expression of Pax5 in B-cells can raise it as a marker for the diagnosis and differentiation of B-cell leukemias and lymphomas as well as account for remission or relapse. Extensive studies on Pax5 along with other genes and immunomarkers are necessary for decisive results in this regard.","['Shahjahani, Mohammad', 'Norozi, Fatemeh', 'Ahmadzadeh, Ahmad', 'Shahrabi, Saeid', 'Tavakoli, Farzaneh', 'Asnafi, Ali Amin', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Shahjahani M', 'Norozi F', 'Ahmadzadeh A', 'Shahrabi S', 'Tavakoli F', 'Asnafi AA', 'Saki N']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141127,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0360-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2015 Jan;32(1):360. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0360-6.

Gene expression is controlled to a great extent by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). Our current knowledge on where and how TFs bind and associate to regulate gene expression is incomplete. A structure-based computational algorithm (TF2DNA) is developed to identify binding specificities of TFs. The method constructs homology models of TFs bound to DNA and assesses the relative binding affinity for all possible DNA sequences using a knowledge-based potential, after optimization in a molecular mechanics force field. TF2DNA predictions were benchmarked against experimentally determined binding motifs. Success rates range from 45% to 81% and primarily depend on the sequence identity of aligned target sequences and template structures, TF2DNA was used to predict 1321 motifs for 1825 putative human TF proteins, facilitating the reconstruction of most of the human gene regulatory network. As an illustration, the predicted DNA binding site for the poorly characterized T-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (TLX3) TF was confirmed with gel shift assay experiments. TLX3 motif searches in human promoter regions identified a group of genes enriched in functions relating to hematopoiesis, tissue morphology, endocrine system and connective tissue development and function.","['Pujato, Mario', 'Kieken, Fabien', 'Skiles, Amanda A', 'Tapinos, Nikos', 'Fiser, Andras']","['Pujato M', 'Kieken F', 'Skiles AA', 'Tapinos N', 'Fiser A']","['Department of Systems and Computational Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY 10461, USA Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY 10461, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY 10461, USA Macromolecular Therapeutics Development, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY 10461, USA.', 'Molecular Neuroscience Laboratory, Geisinger Clinic, 100 North Academy Avenue, Danville, PA 17822, USA.', 'Molecular Neuroscience Laboratory, Geisinger Clinic, 100 North Academy Avenue, Danville, PA 17822, USA.', 'Department of Systems and Computational Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY 10461, USA Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY 10461, USA andras.fiser@einstein.yu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20141126,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,PMC4267649,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['gku1228 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku1228 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Dec 16;42(22):13500-12. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku1228.

Most microRNAs (miRNAs) are 5'-monophosphorylated as a result of sequential endonucleolytic processing by Drosha and Dicer from longer RNA polymerase II (RNAP II)-transcribed primary transcripts. In contrast, bovine leukemia virus (BLV) expresses subgenomic RNAP III transcripts that give rise to miRNAs independent of Drosha processing. Here, we demonstrate that each BLV pre-miRNA is directly transcribed by RNAP III from individual, compact RNAP III type II genes. Thus, similar to manmade RNAP III-generated short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), the BLV pre-miRNAs are initially 5'-triphosphorylated. Nonetheless, the derivative 5p miRNAs and shRNA-generated 5p small RNAs (sRNAs) possess a 5'-monophosphate. Our enzymatic characterization and small RNA sequencing data demonstrate that BLV 5p miRNAs are co-terminal with 5'-triphosphorylated miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). Thus, these results identify a 5'-tri-phosphatase activity that is involved in the biogenesis of BLV miRNAs and shRNA-generated sRNAs. This work advances our understanding of retroviral miRNA and shRNA biogenesis and may have implications regarding the immunostimulatory capacity of RNAP III transcripts.","['Burke, James M', 'Bass, Clovis R', 'Kincaid, Rodney P', 'Sullivan, Christopher S']","['Burke JM', 'Bass CR', 'Kincaid RP', 'Sullivan CS']","['The University of Texas at Austin, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Center for Synthetic and Systems Biology, Center for Infectious Disease and Department of Molecular Biosciences, 1 University Station A5000, Austin TX 78712-0162, USA.', 'The University of Texas at Austin, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Center for Synthetic and Systems Biology, Center for Infectious Disease and Department of Molecular Biosciences, 1 University Station A5000, Austin TX 78712-0162, USA.', 'The University of Texas at Austin, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Center for Synthetic and Systems Biology, Center for Infectious Disease and Department of Molecular Biosciences, 1 University Station A5000, Austin TX 78712-0162, USA.', 'The University of Texas at Austin, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Center for Synthetic and Systems Biology, Center for Infectious Disease and Department of Molecular Biosciences, 1 University Station A5000, Austin TX 78712-0162, USA chris_sullivan@austin.utexas.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141126,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,PMC4267658,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['gku1247 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku1247 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Dec 16;42(22):13949-62. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku1247.

MicroRNAs have florid biological functions and have critical roles in the pathogenesis and prognosis in AML. Expression levels of some single microRNAs are influential for prognosis, but a system integrating several together and considering the weight of each should be more powerful. We thus analyzed the clinical, genetic and microRNA profiling data of 138 de novo AML patients of our institute. By multivariate analysis, we identified that high expression of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p were independent poor prognostic factors, whereas that of hsa-miR-203 had a trend to be a favorable factor. We constructed a scoring system from expression of these three microRNAs by considering the weight of each. The scores correlated with distinct clinical and biological features and outperformed single microRNA expression in prognostication. In both ours and another validation cohort, higher scores were associated with shorter overall survival, independent of other well-known prognostic factors. By analyzing the mRNA expression profiles, we sorted out several cancer-related pathways highly correlated with the microRNA prognostic signature. We conclude that this 3-microRNA scoring system is simple and powerful for risk stratification of de novo AML patients.","['Chuang, M-K', 'Chiu, Y-C', 'Chou, W-C', 'Hou, H-A', 'Chuang, E Y', 'Tien, H-F']","['Chuang MK', 'Chiu YC', 'Chou WC', 'Hou HA', 'Chuang EY', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '1] Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan [2] Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', '1] Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan [2] Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core, Center of Genomic Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141127,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014333 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.333 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1051-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.333.

We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34(+) cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1-BCLAF1-SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34(+) cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.","['Dolatshad, H', 'Pellagatti, A', 'Fernandez-Mercado, M', 'Yip, B H', 'Malcovati, L', 'Attwood, M', 'Przychodzen, B', 'Sahgal, N', 'Kanapin, A A', 'Lockstone, H', 'Scifo, L', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Papaemmanuil, E', 'Smith, C W J', 'Campbell, P J', 'Ogawa, S', 'Maciejewski, J P', 'Cazzola, M', 'Savage, K I', 'Boultwood, J']","['Dolatshad H', 'Pellagatti A', 'Fernandez-Mercado M', 'Yip BH', 'Malcovati L', 'Attwood M', 'Przychodzen B', 'Sahgal N', 'Kanapin AA', 'Lockstone H', 'Scifo L', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Smith CW', 'Campbell PJ', 'Ogawa S', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Cazzola M', 'Savage KI', 'Boultwood J']","['LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, RDM, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, RDM, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, RDM, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, RDM, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '1] Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy [2] Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, RDM, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Translational Haematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, RDM, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Center for Human Genetics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven/University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Downing Site, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK.', 'Cancer Genomics Projects, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Translational Haematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', '1] Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy [2] Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."", 'LLR Molecular Haematology Unit, NDCLS, RDM, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141127,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC4430703,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014331 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.331 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1092-103. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.331.

Comparable OS was observed following alloHSCT and autoHSCT in patients with intermediate-risk AML (60+/-4 vs 54+/-5%).

Collectively, these results show that alloHSCT is to be preferred over chemotherapy as PRT in patients with intermediate- and poor-risk AML aged 40-60 years, whereas autoHSCT remains a treatment option to be considered in patients with intermediate-risk AML.","['Cornelissen, J J', 'Versluis, J', 'Passweg, J R', 'van Putten, W L J', 'Manz, M G', 'Maertens, J', 'Beverloo, H B', 'Valk, P J M', 'van Marwijk Kooy, M', 'Wijermans, P W', 'Schaafsma, M R', 'Biemond, B J', 'Vekemans, M-C', 'Breems, D A', 'Verdonck, L F', 'Fey, M F', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, M', 'Janssen, J J W M', 'Huls, G', 'Kuball, J', 'Pabst, T', 'Graux, C', 'Schouten, H C', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Vellenga, E', 'Ossenkoppele, G', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Cornelissen JJ', 'Versluis J', 'Passweg JR', 'van Putten WL', 'Manz MG', 'Maertens J', 'Beverloo HB', 'Valk PJ', 'van Marwijk Kooy M', 'Wijermans PW', 'Schaafsma MR', 'Biemond BJ', 'Vekemans MC', 'Breems DA', 'Verdonck LF', 'Fey MF', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M', 'Janssen JJ', 'Huls G', 'Kuball J', 'Pabst T', 'Graux C', 'Schouten HC', 'Gratwohl A', 'Vellenga E', 'Ossenkoppele G', 'Lowenberg B']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University medical center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University medical center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Team, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'HOVON Data Center and Department of Trials and Statistics, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University medical center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal medicine, Isala Hospital, Zwolle, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Haga Hospital, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital St Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Stuivenberg Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Departments of Immunology and Hematology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University medical center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Departments of Immunology and Hematology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Mont-Godinne, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Team, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University medical center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20141127,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014332 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.332 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1041-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.332.

KLF2 mutation was found in 40 (42%) of 96 SMZLs, but rarely in other B-cell lymphomas. The majority of KLF2 mutations were frameshift indels or nonsense changes, with missense mutations clustered in the C-terminal zinc finger domains. Functional assays showed that these mutations inactivated the ability of KLF2 to suppress NF-kappaB activation by TLR, BCR, BAFFR and TNFR signalling. Further extensive investigations revealed common and distinct genetic changes between SMZL with and without KLF2 mutation. IGHV1-2 rearrangement and 7q deletion were primarily seen in SMZL with KLF2 mutation, while MYD88 and TP53 mutations were nearly exclusively found in those without KLF2 mutation. NOTCH2, TRAF3, TNFAIP3 and CARD11 mutations were observed in SMZL both with and without KLF2 mutation. Taken together, KLF2 mutation is the most common genetic change in SMZL and identifies a subset with a distinct genotype characterised by multi-genetic changes. These different genetic changes may deregulate various signalling pathways and generate cooperative oncogenic properties, thereby contributing to lymphomagenesis.","['Clipson, A', 'Wang, M', 'de Leval, L', 'Ashton-Key, M', 'Wotherspoon, A', 'Vassiliou, G', 'Bolli, N', 'Grove, C', 'Moody, S', 'Escudero-Ibarz, L', 'Gundem, G', 'Brugger, K', 'Xue, X', 'Mi, E', 'Bench, A', 'Scott, M', 'Liu, H', 'Follows, G', 'Robles, E F', 'Martinez-Climent, J A', 'Oscier, D', 'Watkins, A J', 'Du, M-Q']","['Clipson A', 'Wang M', 'de Leval L', 'Ashton-Key M', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Vassiliou G', 'Bolli N', 'Grove C', 'Moody S', 'Escudero-Ibarz L', 'Gundem G', 'Brugger K', 'Xue X', 'Mi E', 'Bench A', 'Scott M', 'Liu H', 'Follows G', 'Robles EF', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Oscier D', 'Watkins AJ', 'Du MQ']","['Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Institute of Pathology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Cellular Pathology, Southampton University Hospitals National Health Service Trust, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', ""1] Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK [2] Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", ""1] Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK [2] Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', ""Department of Molecular Genetics, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", ""Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", ""Molecular Malignancy Laboratory, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", ""Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", 'Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', ""1] Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."", 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141127,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014330 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.330 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1177-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.330.

This study aimed at analyzing motor performance at the end of the acute treatment phase and reveals potential risk factors for motor deficits. A childhood cancer population with different tumor entities was assessed with the MOON test, which allows for comparison with age- and gender-matched reference values of healthy children, at the end of the acute treatment phase. Forty-seven patients were tested at 7.0 +/- 2.6 months after diagnosis. Significant reductions of motor performance affected muscular explosive strength (P < 0.001), handgrip strength (P < 0.001), muscular endurance of legs (P = 0.035), hand-eye coordination (P < 0.001), static balance (P = 0.003), speed (P = 0.012), and flexibility (P < 0.001). Loss of upper extremity coordination did not achieve statistical significance. Associations between single motor deficits and the tumor entity, age, body mass index, and inactivity during treatment were revealed, whereas no associations were found for gender and vincristine application. CONCLUSION: Overall, motor performance was low in the patient group studied. We recommend that individualized exercise interventions to attenuate motor deficits and promote physical activity are needed during cancer treatment in order to enhance motor performance and improve social participation during and after cancer therapy.","['Gotte, Miriam', 'Kesting, Sabine V', 'Winter, Corinna C', 'Rosenbaum, Dieter', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Gotte M', 'Kesting SV', 'Winter CC', 'Rosenbaum D', 'Boos J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, A1, 48149, Munster, Germany, miriam.goette@ukmuenster.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141128,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-014-2460-x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2015 Jun;174(6):791-9. doi: 10.1007/s00431-014-2460-x.

We examined the functional role of Mer in the CNS in preclinical models and performed correlative studies in 64 t(1;19)-positive and 93 control pediatric ALL patients. ALL cells were analyzed in coculture with human glioma cells and normal rat astrocytes: CNS coculture caused quiescence and protection from methotrexate toxicity in Mer(high) ALL cell lines, which was antagonized by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Mer. Mer expression was upregulated, prosurvival Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling were activated, and secretion of the Mer ligand Galectin-3 was stimulated. Mer(high) t(1;19) primary cells caused CNS involvement to a larger extent in murine xenografts than in their Mer(low) counterparts. Leukemic cells from Mer(high) xenografts showed enhanced survival in coculture. Treatment of Mer(high) patient cells with the Mer-specific inhibitor UNC-569 in vivo delayed leukemia onset, reduced CNS infiltration, and prolonged survival of mice. Finally, a correlation between high Mer expression and CNS positivity upon initial diagnosis was observed in t(1;19) patients.

In this study we investigated whether Wnt signaling pathways played roles in 6-BT-induced differentiation of AML cells. METHODS: We induced differentiation of HL-60 leukemic cells and primary AML cells in vitro using 6-BT. Real-time PCR (qPCR), western blot, and luciferase assays were used to examine the molecules' expression and biological activity in canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. AML cell differentiation was measured by the Nitroblue tetrozolium (NBT) reduction assay. RESULTS: 6-BT regulated the expression of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling molecules in HL-60 cells. Both 6-BT and all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA) reduced canonical Wnt signaling and activated noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling in HL-60 cells. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which activated canonical Wnt signaling, partly abolished the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 6-BT. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), resulting in inactivation of non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling, abolished 6-BT-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Several molecules in the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway were detected in bone marrow samples from AML patients, and the expression of FZD4, FZD5, Wnt5a and RHOU were significantly reduced in newly diagnosed AML samples compared with normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling were involved in 6-BT-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, and played opposite roles in this process. Wnt signaling could be involved in the pathogenesis of AML not only by regulating self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, but also by playing a role in the differentiation of AML cells.","['Zang, Shaolei', 'Liu, Na', 'Wang, Hongchun', 'Wald, David N', 'Shao, Na', 'Zhang, Jingru', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ji, Chunyan', 'Tse, William']","['Zang S', 'Liu N', 'Wang H', 'Wald DN', 'Shao N', 'Zhang J', 'Ma D', 'Ji C', 'Tse W']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P,R, China. jichunyan@sdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141127,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC4289047,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/08/21 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-886 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-886 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Nov 27;14:886. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-886.,,IM,"['Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects']","['0 (6-benzylthioinosine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ethanol suppresses normal hematopoiesis resulting in leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia and may also predispose to the development of diseases such as myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute leukemia. Currently the exact mechanisms by which ethanol perturbs hematopoiesis are unclear. The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family plays a major role in the metabolism of reactive aldehydes derived from ethanol in the liver and other organs. At least one of the ALDH isoforms, ALDH1A1, is expressed at high levels in HSCs in humans, mice, and other organisms. Recent data indicate that ALDH1A1 and possibly other ALDH isoforms may metabolize reactive aldehydes in HSCs and other hematopoietic cells as they do in the liver and elsewhere. In addition, loss of these ALDHs leads to perturbation of a variety of cell processes that may predispose HSCs to disorders in growth and leukemic transformation. From these findings, we suggest a hypothesis that the cytopenias and possible increased risk of MDS and acute leukemia in heavy alcohol users is due to polymorphisms in genes responsible for metabolism of alcohol derived reactive aldehydes and repair of their DNA adducts in HSCs and other hematopoietic cells. In the article, we will summarize the biological properties of hematopoietic cells and diseases related to ethanol consumption, discuss molecular characteristics of ethanol metabolism, and describe a model to explain how ethanol derived reactive aldehydes may promote HSC damage.","['Smith, Clay', 'Gasparetto, Maura', 'Jordan, Craig', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Vasiliou, Vasilis']","['Smith C', 'Gasparetto M', 'Jordan C', 'Pollyea DA', 'Vasiliou V']","['Division of Hematology, University of Colorado, Mail Stop F704, 1665 Aurora Court, Room 4320, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA, Clayton.Smith@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/03/24 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-09614-8_20 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2015;815:349-59. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-09614-8_20.,,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Ethanol/*toxicity', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced']","['3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It depletes serum asparagine (an amino acid necessary for synthesis of cellular proteins), deprives leukemic blast cells of asparagine, and eventually results in cell death. To gain benefit from asparaginase, asparagine depletion must be ensured by giving intensive therapy and completing the full course of treatment. Three formulations of asparaginase exist; two are derived from Escherichia coli, a native form and pegylated form, and one is derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinia asparaginase). Like many large proteins, asparaginases are immunogenic, and some patients develop antibodies to asparaginase. Antibodies may result in clinical hypersensitivity or subclinical hypersensitivity without symptoms, and both can result in a reduction in asparaginase activity and may affect therapeutic benefit. Clinical hypersensitivity is the most common reason for patients to stop asparaginase treatment. Subclinical hypersensitivity can only be identified by laboratory testing; therapeutic monitoring of asparaginase activity is used as a surrogate measure for asparagine depletion.","['Asselin, Barbara L', 'Fisher, Vicki']","['Asselin BL', 'Fisher V']","['University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.', 'Oncology Medical Science Liaisons Team, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin J Oncol Nurs,Clinical journal of oncology nursing,9705336,,['NOTNLM'],"['Erwinia asparaginase', 'antibodies', 'asparaginase', 'hypersensitivity', 'subclinical hypersensitivity']",2014/11/28 06:00,2016/09/24 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['R663W25574452130 [pii]', '10.1188/14.CJON.E107-E112 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2014 Dec;18(6):E107-12. doi: 10.1188/14.CJON.E107-E112.,,,"['Asparaginase/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies demonstrated that Beclin-1 participated in tumorgenesis and was highly expressed in colorectal cancer cells, primary duodenal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and overexpression of Beclin-1 could induce autophagic cell death in leukemia cells. However, the exact effects and molecular mechanisms of Beclin-1-mediated autophagy in osteosarcoma are still unknown up to now. Here, we evaluated the role of Beclin-1 in human osteosarcoma cell lines in vivo and in vitro. In order to characterize the endogenous expression of Beclin-1 in osteosarcoma cell lines, we performed real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. We further analyzed the level of Beclin-1 in osteosarcoma cells after chemotherapy and investigated the impact of autophagy inhibition on chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. We used the small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against Beclin-1 to infect the osteosarcoma cell line with relatively high Belcin-1 expression. Furthermore, we determine the functional relevance of Beclin-1 knockdown to osteosarcoma cell growth, migration, and invasion, and investigate the expression levels of matrix metallopeptidase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85alpha (PI3Kp85alpha), and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT). As a result, HOS osteosarcoma cells exhibited higher Beclin-1 expression. Anticancer agents including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate each induced Beclin-1 up-regulation in human osteosarcoma cells, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin-1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion indicated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenylthetrazolium bromide, would healing, and transwell assays. Cell apoptosis induced by anticancer agents was markedly increased. Knockdown of Beclin-1 or inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (an inhibitor of autophagy and PI3K) rendered them significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy. Addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK partly reversed the cisplatin-induced cell death. When Beclin-1 expression was inhibited, the expression of PI3Kp85alpha, p-AKT, and MMP-9 was downregulated in HOS cells. In addition, the tumor volumes in subcutaneous nude mouse models in Beclin-1-deleted HOS cells were significantly smaller than those of control group. These results suggested that knockdown of Beclin-1 by siRNA exerts inhibitory effects on growth and migration of osteosarcoma cells possibly via blockade of the PI3K/AKT signaling. Beclin-1 knockdown rendered them significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy through activating apoptosis pathway. The results of this study suggest that Beclin-1 plays an important role in proliferation and tumor progression in osteosarcoma and inhibition autophagy can increase the efficacy of anticancer agent therapy.","['Zhang, Wei', 'Li, Qianyi', 'Song, Chao', 'Lao, Lifeng']","['Zhang W', 'Li Q', 'Song C', 'Lao L']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China, WZhangDoctor@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141127,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,,,2014/11/28 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/11/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2868-y [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Apr;36(4):2531-9. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2868-y.
