This abnormality resulted from reciprocal translocation in 17 cases [with chromosomes 4 (n = 5), 10 (n = 2), and variable chromosomes (n = 10)], from deletions in three cases, and from a duplication in one case. The 17 children with 11q23 translocations had higher leukocyte counts (P less than .01) and were more likely to be black (P less than .01) and younger (P = .08) as compared with each of the following non-11q23 translocation groups: t(1;19), t(9;22), random translocations, and cases without translocations. Event-free survival at 3 years for the 11q23 translocation group did not differ significantly from that of the t(1;19), t(9;22), or random translocation groups. Leukemic cells from ten of the 21 patients with an 11q23 structural chromosomal abnormality had an immunophenotype indicative of B-lineage ALL (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD2-, CD3-); this was confirmed by the presence of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in seven cases. In eight of these ten B-lineage cases, the blasts were negative for expression of the CD10 antigen, indicating a primitive stage of B-cell development. Four cases were classified as T-cell ALL, and seven others were characterized by blasts that failed to react with our panel of lineage-associated monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Myeloid antigens were expressed by leukemic cells in three of the cases that were tested. The initial clinical features associated with translocations involving the 11q23 chromosomal region may define a distinct subtype of ALL. Whether the constellation of findings relates to a breakpoint at 11q23 per se or to the specific translocation will require further study.","['Raimondi, S C', 'Peiper, S C', 'Kitchingman, G R', 'Behm, F G', 'Williams, D L', 'Hancock, M L', 'Mirro, J Jr']","['Raimondi SC', 'Peiper SC', 'Kitchingman GR', 'Behm FG', 'Williams DL', 'Hancock ML', 'Mirro J Jr']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['CA-01013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA Probes', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1989/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78968-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1627-34.,,,,,,,,,

After up to 4 h of culture, the label was found mostly in phosphatidylcholine. After 8 h, labelling of phosphatidylethanolamine gradually exceeded that of phosphatidylcholine, until at 24 h, approximate equilibrium labelling of the lipid fractions was attained and 45% of the label was found in phosphatidylethanolamine, 35% in phosphatidylcholine, 18% in the phosphatidylserine/inositide fraction and the remainder in the neutral lipid fraction. Stimulation of cells with A23187 after 30 min of labelling caused release of [3H]arachidonic acid which was accountable by a decrease in radioactivity of phosphatidylcholine, whereas stimulation of cells after 24 h of labelling caused the release of radioactive arachidonic acid, which was accompanied by a decrease of label in both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Incubation of the labelled cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate prior to ionophore addition enhanced both the release of [3H]arachidonic acid and its metabolites and the decrease in label of the same phospholipids as those affected by ionophore alone. Under our conditions, the enhancement effects of phorbol ester were greatest after 2-5 min of preincubation, prior to ionophore addition. The results suggest that in basophilic leukemia cells, arachidonic acid release proceeds from several pools of phospholipids and that the activity of the phospholipase(s) involved is modulated by protein kinase C.","['Froissart, P', 'Unligil, P', 'Aubry, H', 'Proulx, P']","['Froissart P', 'Unligil P', 'Aubry H', 'Proulx P']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/04/26 00:00,1989/04/26 00:01,['1989/04/26 00:00'],"['1989/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(89)90352-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(89)90352-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Apr 26;1002(3):376-81. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(89)90352-4.,,,,,,,,,

In addition, this system can also be applied to analyze the patho-physiological roles of the introduced gene product within the mouse whole body. Therefore, this system is one of the best approaches to analyze the mechanism of oncogenesis. The chromosomal translocation is one of the mechanisms leading to the activation of oncogene. In the case of lymphoid cell tumors, the reciprocal translocation between chromosome No. 8 and No. 14 is frequently observed. With this translocation, c-myc gene can be activated by the enhancer of immunoglobulin heavy chain (E mu). We and others have demonstrated that the E mu-myc gene could induce lymphomas in transgenic mice. Following these observation we have currently many examples that activated oncogene can induce variety tumors, giving basic knowledge about the relationship between activated oncogene and cell-type specificity of tumor. On the other hand, molecular mechanism of oncogenesis which is caused by viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is totally unknown. One main reason is the absence of animal model for these diseases. To overcome this problem, we have attempted and succeeded to produce a transgenic mouse model which consistently produces HBV. Using these mice, it will be possible to elucidate the molecular mechanism of development of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.","['Yamamura, K']",['Yamamura K'],['Institute for Medical Genetics Kumamoto University Medical School.'],['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Attempts to overcome this problem have included specific CNS-directed treatment in the form of direct intrathecal drug injection, cranial irradiation, and alteration in the dose and schedule of systemic agents to enhance their CNS penetration. Use of these treatments and strategies has led to the effective prevention and control of meningeal leukemia. Intrathecal therapy, primarily with methotrexate or cytosine arabinoside, is a form of regional chemotherapy that can achieve very high drug concentrations at the target site [i.e., in the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)] with a low total dose. Therefore, there is minimal systemic toxicity. The dose and schedules, clinical pharmacology, and toxicities of the commonly used intrathecal agents are discussed in detail in this article. Another approach to overcoming the limited penetration of antileukemic drugs into the CNS has been the use of high-dose systemic therapy. Methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside in high doses have produced favorable clinical responses in patients with overt meningeal disease, and pharmacokinetic studies have documented cytotoxic concentrations of these drugs within the cerebrospinal fluid. A clear understanding of the CNS pharmacology of the antileukemic drugs is required in order to use these agents in the safest and most efficacious manner for the treatment of meningeal leukemia.","['Balis, F M', 'Poplack, D G']","['Balis FM', 'Poplack DG']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiotepa/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-198921000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1989 Spring;11(1):74-86. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198921000-00017.,74,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha exerts direct cytotoxicity toward some tumor cells in vitro and produces hemorrhagic tumor necrosis in vivo. In human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells, human recombinant TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) exhibits a small early proliferative effect (within 48 h), followed by marked cytostatic activity at 96 h after the addition of rTNF-alpha. Cytostasis is contiguous with an induction of cell differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage lineage. The cell proliferation effects and the induction of the differentiated phenotype are preceded by an approximate 5-fold increase in c-fos mRNA levels within 90 min after rTNF-alpha treatment of log phase HL-60 cells. Nuclear in vitro transcription assays indicate that the effect of rTNF-alpha on c-fos mRNA abundance is controlled at the transcriptional level. We have also used a postembedding immunocolloidal gold electron microscopy technique to localize and semiquantitate pp55c-fos proto-oncoprotein levels in the nucleus of both control and rTNF-alpha-treated HL-60 leukemia cells. In response to rTNF-alpha, we have observed a rapid and transient accumulation of pp55c-fos in discrete nuclear substructures within 2 h after treatment. C-fos staining appears in clusters, which are preferentially localized over semi-condensed chromatin and interchromatin granules.

Compound 10 was significantly less inhibitory toward the phosphorylase with a Ki value of 141 microM; its lack of substrate activity was attributed to rapid nonenzymatic degradation. The 50% growth inhibitory concentrations (48 h) of 9 were 300 and 200 microM in L1210 and L5178Y cells, respectively; for 10, these respective values were 2 and 0.7 microM.

Characterization of the human CD8 alpha gene.,3312-9,"We have determined the organization and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the human T cell surface glycoprotein CD8 alpha. This gene spans approximately 8 kb and is organized into six exons which encode separate functional domains of the protein. Exon 1 encodes the 5' untranslated region and leader peptide, exon II the Ig V-like region, exon III the hinge-like region, exon IV the transmembrane domain, and exons V and VI the cytoplasmic tail. Alternative splicing that excludes nucleotide sequences from exon IV results in a transcript which encodes a secreted form of the protein. This transcript accounts for approximately 15% of the total CD8 alpha mRNA in human T cell leukemia lines and in normal human tissues. Secreted CD8 alpha protein can be detected in culture supernatants of T cell leukemia lines and PHA-stimulated PBMC by immunoprecipitation with the anti-CD8 alpha mAb OKT8 or with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for the 28 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of CD8 alpha. The secreted CD8 alpha protein forms homodimers; when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 27 or 54 kDa under reducing or non-reducing conditions, respectively. Human secreted CD8 alpha may serve an immunoregulatory role for the interactions of T cells with their targets in vivo.","['Norment, A M', 'Lonberg, N', 'Lacy, E', 'Littman, D R']","['Norment AM', 'Lonberg N', 'Lacy E', 'Littman DR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CD8 Antigens', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 May 1;142(9):3312-9.,,,,,"['GENBANK/M26313', 'GENBANK/M26314', 'GENBANK/M26315']",,,,

This finding led us to make the hypothesis that HMM activity could correlate with HMPMM ability to interact irreversibly with DNA and proteins in tumors.","['Dubois, J', 'Atassi, G', 'Hanocq, M', 'Abikhalil, F']","['Dubois J', 'Atassi G', 'Hanocq M', 'Abikhalil F']","['Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Institut de Pharmacie, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Triazines)', 'Q8BIH59O7H (Altretamine)']",IM,"['Altretamine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Hydroxylation', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Triazines/*pharmacokinetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Jan-Feb;9(1):255-9.,,,,,,,,,

Both these sources are utilised by tumors and other tissues with a high demand for polyamines to ensure their polyamine requirement. Consequently, combined treatment of tumor-bearing animals with an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (e.g. alpha-difluoromethylornithine) and polyamine oxidase (e.g. N,N'- bis-allenylputrescine) has an antitumoral effect superior to that of either drug alone. In the present work, it was demonstrated that the alimentary tract is a third important source of polyamines which maintains tumor growth. Gastrointestinal polyamines are of alimentary origin, and are also formed by aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. They can be reduced by feeding a polyamine deficient diet together with antibiotics that are suitable for decontaminating the gastrointestinal tract. This treatment combined with the administration of the mentioned inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase and polyamine oxidase completely prevents Lewis lung carcinoma from growing, and prolongs considerably the average life span of L1210 leukemia mice. The results of the polyamine analyses of tumors, leukemia cells and tissues are compatible with the notion that the effective blocking of the three main putrescine sources (intracellular decarboxylation of ornithine, formation of putrescine from N1-acetylspermidine, and the gastrointestinal tract) produces a very strong cytostatic effect. It is expected that the clinical efficacy of polyamine antimetabolites can be considerably improved by measures analogous to those applied in this pilot study.","['Sarhan, S', 'Knodgen, B', 'Seiler, N']","['Sarhan S', 'Knodgen B', 'Seiler N']","['Merrell Dow Research Institute, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', '1YVR349GN4 (MDL 72527)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biogenic Polyamines/analysis/*physiology', 'Digestive System/*metabolism', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Putrescine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Jan-Feb;9(1):215-23.,,,,,,,,,

Neoplasms belonging to distinct clinicopathologic categories of T cell neoplasia often exhibit characteristic immunophenotypic profiles. Approximately 80% of lymphoblastic lymphomas and 20% of acute lymphoblastic leukemias express phenotypes consistent with prethymic and intrathymic stages of T cell differentiation, including intranuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas of mycosis fungoides type usually express pan-T cell antigens CD2, CD5, and CD3, often lack the pan-T cell antigen CD7, and usually express the mature, peripheral helper subset phenotype, CD4+ CD8-. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas of nonmycosis fungoides type and peripheral T cell lymphomas often lack one or more pan-T cell antigens and, in addition, occasionally express the anomalous CD4+ CD8+ or CD4- CD8- phenotypes. T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease is divisable into two broad categories: those cases that are CD3 antigen positive and exhibit clonal T cell receptor beta chain (TCR-beta) gene rearrangements and those cases that are CD3 antigen negative and exhibit the TCR-beta gene germline configuration. Human T cell lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) associated Japanese, Carribean, and sporadic adult T cell leukemia/lymphomas usually express pan-T cell antigens, the CD4+ CD8- phenotype, and various T cell-associated activation antigens, including the interleukin-2 receptor (CD25). Immunophenotypic criteria useful in the immunodiagnosis of T cell neoplasia include, in increasing order of utility, T cell predominance, T cell subset antigen restriction, anomalous T cell subset antigen expression, and deletion of one or more pan-T cell antigens. Only in exceptional circumstances do normal, non-neoplastic T cell populations express the CD4- CD8- or the CD4+ CD8+ phenotype and/or lack one or more pan-T cell antigens. T cell receptor beta chain gene rearrangement analysis represents an accurate, objective, and sensitive molecular genetic marker of T cell lineage and clonality that allows discrimination among non-T cell, polyclonal T cell and monoclonal T cell populations. Non-T cells exhibit the TCR-beta gene germline configuration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Knowles, D M']",['Knowles DM'],"['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['CA48236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Skin Diseases/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/ultrastructure']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1989 Apr;134(4):761-85.,214,,,,,PMC1879785,,,

Data from 71 matched historical control patients who had received conventional treatment were used for survival analysis. Hematologic response (reversal of cytopenias) was achieved by 18% of the control patients versus 73% of the IFN-treated patients. This response was associated with virtual elimination of the need for transfusions and splenectomy as well as dramatic decreases in the frequency of fatal infections (22.5% vs. 1.6%) and the 12-month mortality rate (28% vs. 3.1%). Direct costs per patient per year for medical care (transfusions, antibiotic treatment, splenectomy, and chemotherapy) of those receiving IFN alfa-2b were 2.8-fold lower than costs for medical care of control patients ($5,027 vs. $14,046). Indirect costs, which reflect the present value of future earnings lost due to premature death, were 13.3-fold lower for IFN-treated patients than for control patients ($4,771 vs. $63,507).

In this contribution we show that L-tryptophan interferes with some biological effects of the antileukemic and anti-human immunodeficiency virus agent avarol, possibly by different mechanisms. Avarol has been shown to be able to modulate posttranscriptional events of mRNA synthesis, resulting in an increase of the base-sequence complexities of the nonabundant and rare mRNA classes. Here it is demonstrated that this change in mRNA abundancy distribution is accompanied by an increase in the level of some specific, low abundant mRNAs (ras and c-myc). Addition of L-tryptophan was found to abolish avarol-caused gene relaxation in L1210 mouse leukemia cells. In addition, L-tryptophan suppressed the induction of gamma-interferon mRNA production in human peripheral blood lymphocytes.

After T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplantation (TD-BMT), these cells have an activated pattern of target cell killing; they also secrete lymphokines including gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and may have a significant role as a primary defense against viral reactivation and in the elimination of residual host malignancy. We studied 43 patients with hematologic malignancy, treated by allogeneic TD-BMT, autologous nondepleted BMT, or chemotherapy alone to investigate (a) the mechanisms underlying the generation of these activated killer cells, (b) the range of conditions under which they are produced, and (c) their surface phenotype. We showed that gamma-IFN-secreting activated killer cells with the capacity to kill MHC-nonidentical NK-resistant targets are generated 4 to 6 weeks after either allogeneic TD-BMT or autologous BMT but do not appear after treatment with chemotherapy. Production therefore is not owing to T-cell depletion per se or to host donor alloreactivity, nor is it caused by stimulation by alloantigens contained in blood product support since no significant difference exists between allograft and chemotherapy patients in the number of units of blood platelet support given in the posttreatment period. Because most patients had no evidence of stimulation from virus reactivation/infection, the phenomenon of activation therefore appears to represent posttransplant immune disregulation following repopulation of the host immune system with lymphoid subsets derived exclusively from blood and marrow. Activated killing is predominantly mediated by the CD16+ CD3- subset, but substantial activity remains in the CD16- CD3+ cell fraction. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) that block interaction with class-I MHC molecules at the level of target cell (W6/32 anti-HLA class I) or effector cell (CD8) do not inhibit killing by CD16- CD3+ cells. Activated killer cells may contribute to the lower risk of relapse after marrow transplantation as compared with intensive chemotherapy.","['Reittie, J E', 'Gottlieb, D', 'Heslop, H E', 'Leger, O', 'Drexler, H G', 'Hazlehurst, G', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Prentice, H G', 'Brenner, M K']","['Reittie JE', 'Gottlieb D', 'Heslop HE', 'Leger O', 'Drexler HG', 'Hazlehurst G', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Prentice HG', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, England.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cricetinae', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*surgery/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Diseases/etiology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75564-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Apr;73(5):1351-8.,,,,,,,,,

The mean interval between the end of treatment and investigation was 4.6 years. The mean age at onset of the disease was 3.2 years and at investigation 10.7 years. The average attained height equalled -0.3 SD at onset, and -1.0 SD at the time of investigation. Secretion of growth hormone was substantially reduced compared with controls and did not increase during puberty. A prompt rise in growth hormone secretion was seen after injection of growth hormone releasing hormone, but the mean maximum growth hormone concentration was, however, only 25 mU/l. There was no correlation between the 24 hour secretion and growth hormone response to growth hormone releasing hormone, or the time since irradiation. These results confirm earlier work that suggested that girls who had received treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, that included cranial irradiation, have a comparative growth hormone insufficiency characterised by normal prepubertal growth and slow growth during puberty because of an inability to respond to the increased demands for growth hormone at that time.","['Moell, C', 'Garwicz, S', 'Westgren, U', 'Wiebe, T', 'Albertsson-Wikland, K']","['Moell C', 'Garwicz S', 'Westgren U', 'Wiebe T', 'Albertsson-Wikland K']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9034-39-3 (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Body Height', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Puberty', 'Time Factors']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.64.2.252 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1989 Feb;64(2):252-8. doi: 10.1136/adc.64.2.252.,,,,,,PMC1791878,,,

Although exposure to the cytotoxic agents is believed to be the causative factor, the reason only certain individuals develop the second malignancy is unknown. Some studies have suggested that these individuals might be predisposed to cancer because of an inherent sensitivity to the alkylating agents used in cancer therapy. We have reported that these individuals with therapy-related acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (t-ANLL) have reduced endogenous levels of the repair protein O6-alkylguanine alkyltransferase (AGT). To further investigate the etiology of this disease, alkylation-induced sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) formation in individuals who developed second malignancies, was compared to other patient groups and normal controls. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with (1) t-ANLL, (2) primary forms of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL de novo), (3) patients with primary malignancies at risk of developing secondary disease, and (4) unexposed, healthy controls were treated in vitro with N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine or mitomycin C. Baseline and mutagen-induced frequencies of SCEs were determined. These studies failed to detect any increased sensitivity in those patients who developed second malignancies as compared to controls or patients with de novo forms of the same disease. Also, no correlation between sensitivity to the alkylating agent N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine and endogenous levels of the AGT repair protein was found.

The study reported here has examined TPA-induced signaling mechanisms responsible for the regulation of TNF gene expression in these cells. Run-on assays demonstrated that TPA increases TNF mRNA levels by transcriptional activation of this gene. The induction of TNF transcripts by TPA was inhibited by the isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative H7 but not by HA1004, suggesting that this effect of TPA is mediated by activation of protein kinase C. TPA treatment also resulted in increased arachidonic acid release. Moreover, inhibitors of phospholipase A2 blocked both the increase in arachidonic acid release and the induction of TNF transcripts. These findings suggest that TPA induces TNF gene expression through the formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Although indomethacin had no detectable effect on this induction of TNF transcripts, ketoconazole, an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, blocked TPA-induced increases in TNF mRNA levels. Moreover, TNF mRNA levels were increased by the 5-lipoxygenase metabolite leukotriene B4. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase metabolite prostaglandin E2 inhibited the induction of TNF transcripts by TPA. Taken together, these results suggest that TPA induces TNF gene expression through the arachidonic acid cascade and that the level of TNF transcripts is regulated by metabolites of the pathway, leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2.","['Horiguchi, J', 'Spriggs, D', 'Imamura, K', 'Stone, R', 'Luebbers, R', 'Kufe, D']","['Horiguchi J', 'Spriggs D', 'Imamura K', 'Stone R', 'Luebbers R', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],['CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.1.252-258.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Jan;9(1):252-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.1.252-258.1989.,,,,,,PMC362167,,,

An intact lipoxygenase pathway, and the synthesis of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), which requires reduced glutathione, is essential for in vitro growth of normal myeloid progenitors (CFU-GM). We tested the effects of nordihydroguiaretic acid (NDGA) and caffeic acid (CA), inhibitors of lipoxygenase; buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which inhibits glutathione synthesis; and Acivicin, a glutamine antagonist, on these cell lines and compared the effects with those seen on CFU-GM. In semisolid culture, all three cell lines were inhibited by NDGA, CA, and BSO in a dose-dependent manner similar to that in CFU-GM but were relatively resistant to Acivicin. In liquid culture, all three cell lines exhibited relative resistance to inhibition by both BSO and Acivicin, with KG-1 also demonstrating relative resistance to inhibition by NDGA and CA. The inhibition of HL-60 by CA could be completely reversed by the addition of exogenous leukotriene D4. The dependence on the lipoxygenase pathway may be altered to varying degrees in different leukemic lines and may depend on culture conditions. Whether these changes may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia or merely represent secondary metabolic changes is yet to be determined.","['Miller, A M', 'Cullen, M K', 'Kobb, S M', 'Weiner, R S']","['Miller AM', 'Cullen MK', 'Kobb SM', 'Weiner RS']","['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida.']",['eng'],['CA 44838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Caffeic Acids)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'U2S3A33KVM (caffeic acid)']",IM,"['Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Caffeic Acids/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*pathology', 'Leukotrienes/pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase/*physiology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0022-2143(89)90098-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1989 Mar;113(3):355-61.,,,,,,,,,

It was used as a source of homogenous monocytic cells as a model to determine whether a variety of highly purified or recombinant cytokines could induce HLA-DR expression and the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) alone induced HLA-DR. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin (LT) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone were able to induce IL-1 but not HLA-DR. When IFN-gamma was combined with TNF, induction of HLA-DR and IL-1 was enhanced in a synergistic manner. These effects were detectable at a pretranslational level as synergistic effects were observed on DR alpha mRNA and IL-1 beta mRNA levels. The results demonstrate the specificity of IFN-gamma as the inductive stimulus for HLA-DR expression by THP-1 cells. As IFN-gamma and TNF are products of activated T cells, the synergistic role for these molecules in macrophage activation is discussed.","['Portillo, G', 'Turner, M', 'Chantry, D', 'Feldmann, M']","['Portillo G', 'Turner M', 'Chantry D', 'Feldmann M']","['Charing Cross Sunley Research Centre, Hammersmith, London.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1989 Feb;66(2):170-5.,,,,,,PMC1385082,,,

These effects are dose-dependent since only doses of TsF at 20 micrograms or greater are effective. A similar effect was found when A10F was administered to DBA/2 mice 10 days prior to challenge with two unrelated tumors (L1210 and M-1).

This study used a detailed economic analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness of several techniques for platelet crossmatching and that of HLA-matched single-donor platelets. The crossmatch methods evaluated were a microlymphocytotoxicity test (LCT), an immunofluorescence technique (PSIFT), a radioactive antiglobulin test (PRAT), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The analysis was based on the need to support 100 refractory patients with acute leukemia with a presumed requirement of 500 transfusions. The relative costs for a successful crossmatch were: PRAT less than LCT less than LCT + PRAT less than PSIFT less than ELISA. In the comparison of the crossmatch methods, an increase in costs was generally associated with an increase in the number of successful transfusion episodes. However, decreasing marginal gains were seen. The HLA-matched single-donor platelets were relatively cost-inefficient in comparison to the crossmatch-compatible platelets.

Stably transfected cells expressing varying levels of cell-surface class I HLA have been selected by fluorescent activated cell sorting and tested for susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis by freshly isolated peripheral blood NK cells from nine normal volunteers as well as by cloned human NK effectors and tumor cells from a patient with an NK cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Expression of class I HLA did not alter the susceptibility of K562 or MOLT-4 target cells to NK-mediated cytolysis by any of the effectors tested. In addition, the class I HLA-expressing transfectant cells were identical to mock transfected cells in their ability to compete for lysis in cold target inhibition assays. Treatment of both mock-transfected and class I HLA-transfected K562 cells with IFN-gamma resulted in decreased susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis which was independent of the total level of class I HLA expression. These results demonstrate that the level of target cell class I HLA expression is not sufficient to determine susceptibility or resistance to NK-mediated cytolysis of the classical NK targets K562 and MOLT-4.","['Leiden, J M', 'Karpinski, B A', 'Gottschalk, L', 'Kornbluth, J']","['Leiden JM', 'Karpinski BA', 'Gottschalk L', 'Kornbluth J']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48105.']",['eng'],['CA37827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Transfection']",1989/03/15 00:00,1989/03/15 00:01,['1989/03/15 00:00'],"['1989/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Mar 15;142(6):2140-7.,,,,,,,,,

It is assumed that LAK cells lyse their targets solely by direct cell to cell contact, possibly involving the degranulation and exocytosis of pore-forming elements, similar to that observed with cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells. Reported here are studies demonstrating that LAK cells release factor(s) that are cytotoxic for a human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, when stimulated with tumor cells. The factor(s) are slow acting and maximum cytotoxicity is observed only in a 72-h cytotoxic assay. The ability of LAK cells to secrete cytotoxic factor(s) is dependent on both the ratio of LAK cells to stimulating tumor cells as well as the length of their coincubation. A number of similarly slow acting cytokines that are cytostatic and/or cytotoxic for tumor cells have been described. We tested the ability of specific polyclonal antibodies directed against TNF, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma to neutralize the cytotoxic supernatant activity. Only antibodies specific for IFN-gamma and TNF were neutralizing. We measured the amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF in the cytotoxic supernatants and determined that increased amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF were released after LAK cell-tumor cell interactions compared to supernatants of LAK cells alone or tumor cell alone. Comparable concentrations of human rIFN-gamma and rTNF resulted in similar levels (50 to 90%) of MCF-7 cell cytotoxicity as those observed with the stimulated LAK cell supernatants. We thus concluded that the majority of the cytotoxic activity released by LAK cells when stimulated with tumor cells was attributed to the synergistic activities of IFN-gamma and TNF. The significance of these observations in relation to the possible mechanisms by which LAK cells mediate cytolysis is discussed.","['Chong, A S', 'Scuderi, P', 'Grimes, W J', 'Hersh, E M']","['Chong AS', 'Scuderi P', 'Grimes WJ', 'Hersh EM']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.']",['eng'],['GM 34121/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-2', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1989/03/15 00:00,1989/03/15 00:01,['1989/03/15 00:00'],"['1989/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Mar 15;142(6):2133-9.,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomally abnormal clones were identified in 35 of 61 patients studied: all with NHL, all with HCL, three of eight with WM, and eight of 29 with plasma cell disorder. The most recurrent chromosomal abnormality, observed in 26 of the 35 patients whose chromosomes were abnormal, was a rearrangement involving chromosome 14, in which an additional segment was attached at band 32 in the long arm to form a 14q+ marker chromosome. This rearrangement was seen in 17 patients with NHL, three with HCL, one with WM, and five with plasma cell disorder. In NHL, the rearrangement correlates with histological subclasses: t(14;18) in all four patients with malignant lymphoma (ML)-follicular, mixed small cleaved and large cell; t(8;14) or its variant form, t(8;22), in all six with ML-small noncleaved cell; and t(11;14) in two of three with ML-diffuse, mixed small and large cell.

The donor sites for these 14q+ were assigned to oncogene loci: c-myc (8q24), bcl-1 (11q13), and bcl-2 (18q21).

In the adult, T cells bearing the gamma delta TCR are a minority and they have the phenotype CD3+, CD4-, CD8-/+. By using appropriate probes, rearrangements of the TCR alpha, beta, and gamma genes have been extensively investigated in a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders. Because the TCR delta gene has been cloned only recently, no comparable information exists with respect to this in human leukemias. We report the analysis of the TCR delta gene configuration in 21 T-cell acute and chronic leukemias, 40 B-cell leukemias, 4 acute myeloid leukemias of difficult classification, and 12 normal controls. The TCR delta genes were structurally modified in all T-cell disorders and in germ-line configuration in all controls and all but one case of non-T-cell leukemias tested. In one case of T-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CD3+, CD4-, CD8+) we found rearrangement and expression of TCR gamma and delta (but not alpha and beta), suggesting that leukemic transformation took place in a cell bearing a TCR gamma delta rather than a TCR alpha beta. In two cases of pre-T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, only delta was rearranged out of the three TCR genes tested. This finding is in keeping with the suggestion that the TCR delta gene might be the first to rearrange in T cell ontogeny, and that its mode of rearrangement may play a role in the subsequent choice of the cell between production of a TCR alpha beta or gamma delta. Thus, TCR delta chain gene analysis can provide novel information of the clonal nature of T-cell disorders, particularly if the analysis of the beta and gamma genes has not been helpful.","['Foroni, L', 'Laffan, M', 'Boehm, T', 'Rabbitts, T H', 'Catovsky, D', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Foroni L', 'Laffan M', 'Boehm T', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Catovsky D', 'Luzzatto L']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Post Graduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76307-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb;73(2):559-65.,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the configuration of the TCR-alpha gene was examined using newly developed genomic J alpha probes capable of detecting TCR-alpha gene rearrangements involving joining (J)alpha regions up to 85 kilobase (kb) from constant (C)alpha. In this study, TCR-alpha gene rearrangements were detected in 16 of the 29 patients. Thus, the frequency of TCR-alpha gene rearrangements in B precursor ALL was as high as with TCR-gamma (15 of 29) and was higher than observed for TCR-beta (nine of 29). Truncated transcripts were frequently observed in cells with rearrangements of the TCR-beta or alpha gene. In contrast, TCR-gamma transcripts were detected in only one patient despite the high incidence of TCR-gamma gene rearrangements. Results presented here suggest that although expression of TCR genes was weak in B-precursor ALL cells compared with T-lineage cells, these genes experience both transcriptional and recombinational crossover in B-precursor ALL. The results also suggest that neither transcription nor gene rearrangement, when examined alone, are sufficient to assign T or B lymphocyte lineage in lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Hara, J', 'Benedict, S H', 'Champagne, E', 'Mak, T W', 'Minden, M', 'Gelfand, E W']","['Hara J', 'Benedict SH', 'Champagne E', 'Mak TW', 'Minden M', 'Gelfand EW']","['Division of Basic Sciences, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO 80206.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Infant', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76300-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb;73(2):500-8.,,,,,,,,,

Comparison with dihydrofolate reductases from other sources.,2625-33,"The transient state kinetics of catalysis for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from several enzyme sources including highly purified recombinant human enzyme (rHDHFR) have been examined. Like DHFR from Escherichia coli, the enzyme from Lactobacillus casei, and isoenzyme 2 from Streptococcus faecium exhibit a slow increase in activity upon addition of substrates to enzyme. No slow hysteresis of this type was detected with recombinant human DHFR (rHDHFR) or DHFR from chicken or bovine liver or L1210 mouse leukemia cells (MDHFR). In contrast, both rHDHFR and MDHFR exhibited a very rapid decrease in activity (t1/2 = 30 and 20 ms, respectively) during a phase that occurred after the first turnover of the enzyme but before establishment of the steady state. This intermediate phase was not observed for the bacterial enzymes or the avian enzyme, nor was it observed with a mutant of rHDHFR in which Phe-31 has been replaced by leucine. For rHDHFR the intermediate phase is not a consequence of product inhibition, substrate depletion, or enzyme instability. It may therefore be concluded that this unusual transient state kinetic behavior results from the existence of two conformers of the enzyme, one of which has a higher turnover number than the other with the equilibrium shifting in favor of the less active conformer during the course of catalysis. The equilibrium is particularly favorable for the less active conformer when NADP is present in the active site of rHDHFR, whereas bound tetrahydrofolate favors the more active conformer. The more active conformer has a 6-fold higher Km for dihydrofolate than does the less active conformer. The existence of these conformers is likely to produce cooperative behavior by rHDHFR in vivo.","['Appleman, J R', 'Beard, W A', 'Delcamp, T J', 'Prendergast, N J', 'Freisheim, J H', 'Blakley, R L']","['Appleman JR', 'Beard WA', 'Delcamp TJ', 'Prendergast NJ', 'Freisheim JH', 'Blakley RL']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 31922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactobacillus casei/enzymology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Ligands', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Streptococcus/enzymology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/*metabolism']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)81659-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Feb 15;264(5):2625-33.,,,,,,,,,

Synchronized (G0/G1 or G1/S) and unsynchronized cultures are susceptible to this phenomenon. BTC prevents two requirements from being met. (1) It deprives the cytosol of the acetyl CoA necessary for operation of the cholesterogenesis pathway, thereby depleting the supply of mevalonate (MVA) implicated as a requirement for triggering DNA synthesis. (2) It behaves as a nonmetabolizable divalent cation chelator, reducing the availability of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which, in whole cells are both required for DNA synthesis. Such inhibitions are reversible. In whole cells, removal of the inhibitor yields rapid and complete recovery of DNA synthesis. During the prolonged presence of BTC, the addition of MVA plus the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 allows partial recovery of DNA synthesis. In isolated, DNA synthesizing nuclei, on the other hand, the slight inhibition of DNA synthesis by BTC is reversed merely by addition of Mg2+. We conclude that the uninterrupted production of citrate-derived MVA via the mitochondria, at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (i.e., subsequent to peak cholesterol synthesis), is mandatory for initiating the duplication of the cell genome. Consequently, by its mitochondrial site of action, BTC can severely limit the otherwise continuous supply of MVA during late G1, which in turn, prevents entry into the S phase, and thereby cell proliferation.","['Rao, S', 'Coleman, P S']","['Rao S', 'Coleman PS']","['Department of Biology, New York University 10003.']",['eng'],['CA 28677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Citrates)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Tricarboxylic Acids)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '569-51-7 (benzene 1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene Derivatives/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Citrates/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tricarboxylic Acids/pharmacology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-4827(89)90062-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1989 Feb;180(2):341-52. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(89)90062-1.,,,,,,,,,

Is the infrequent expression of T/B cell markers sufficient to establish a lymphoid origin for Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg cells?,203-12,"Most Hodgkin's mononuclear cells and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells are characterized by the expression of the antigen CD30, but not of T or B cell markers. A few H-RS cells, however, may express a limited number of T or B cell markers. Whether this expression is sufficient to allow the conclusion that H-RS cells are derived from T and/or B cells has been debated vigorously. The present study examined whether CD30 and aberrant T and B cell markers are expressed in cell lines that are well documented as being derived from the granulocyte/monocyte/histiocyte lineage. These cells included HL-60, KG-1, ML-1, THP-1, and U-937. Four other cell lines derived from patients with leukemias/lymphomas of monocytic or granulocytic origins also were studied. These cells included BV173, CML-Brown, CTV-2, and SU-DHL-1. If aberrant expression is detected, by analogy one may expect that rare T or B cell marker expression may occur in H-RS cells, because abundant evidence has indicated that H-RS cells may be related to cells in histiocyte lineage. In all nine of the cell lines studied, it was confirmed that numerous monocyte/granulocyte markers were expressed. The marker expression was enhanced after cells were induced to differentiate with phorbol ester (TPA) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It was noted that several T and B cell markers also were expressed by these cells. Unlike the expression of monocyte/granulocyte markers, the expression of T or B cell markers was not affected, or only minimally affected, by treatment of the cells with TPA or TNF. Five of the cell lines (BV173, CML-Brown, CTV-2, SU-DHL-1, and THP-1) were shown to be CD30-positive. In CTV-2 and BV173, the expression of CD30 was greatly increased after induction with phorbol ester or TNF. Based on these studies, the following conclusions were reached: 1) The expression of aberrant B or T cell markers is not an uncommon finding in granulocyte/monocyte/histiocyte-related neoplastic cells. 2) The expression of granulocyte/monocyte markers in these cells is related to the state of cell differentiation, whereas the expression of T or B cell markers is not. 3) CD30 is not necessarily a proliferation-related antigen, and its expression is not a sole property of T or B cells, but can be present in granulocyte/monocyte/histiocyte-related cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hsu, S M', 'Hsu, P L']","['Hsu SM', 'Hsu PL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston.']",['eng'],['CA 47462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Histiocytes/physiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*cytology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Monocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1989 Jan;134(1):203-12.,,,,,,PMC1879540,,,

When peripheral blood blasts were cultured in suspension in flat-bottomed vessels at low cell numbers (15.6-500 x 10(3)/ml), the rate of DNA synthesis [( 3H]thymidine incorporation) was proportional to cell density. When cells were cultured under otherwise identical conditions in round-bottomed vessels, to induce cell crowding, the rate of DNA synthesis was independent of cell numbers and was significantly augmented (p less than or equal to 0.01). Physical separation of cells in round-bottomed (crowded) cultures by latex beads reduced DNA synthesis to the same rate as that in flat-bottomed (non-crowded) cultures. In contrast, addition of mitomycin-treated autologous blasts had little effect in crowded cultures but increased DNA synthesis in non-crowded cultures. DNA synthesis was also enhanced: by reducing culture volume to concentrate any diffusible factors produced by the cells or by blast cell conditioned medium from autologous blasts grown under crowded conditions. Cells cultured in suspension for 72 hr under crowded/non-crowded conditions both formed blast cell colonies in methyl cellulose; however, the number of colonies derived from crowded cultures was greater. These results indicate that cell proximity promotes proliferation of blasts and blast cell progenitors; both close cell contact and autostimulatory soluble factors are important in regulating growth of AML blasts.","['Reilly, I A', 'Kozlowski, R', 'Russell, N H']","['Reilly IA', 'Kozlowski R', 'Russell NH']","['University Department of Haematology, City Hospital, Nottingham, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['*Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Culture Media', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Feb;3(2):145-50.,,,,,,,,,

We have found that a 24-h treatment of the promonocytic leukemia cell line U937 with rIFN-gamma decreases the expression of the CD4 Ag by 50% as measured by cytofluorographic analysis. The decrease in CD4 expression was dependent on the concentration of rIFN-gamma, with maximal effects occurring at 20 to 200 U/ml. The decrease appeared to be due to actual loss of the CD4 molecule from the cell surface rather than masking of a particular epitope, inasmuch as similar results were obtained with the OKT4 and OKT4A antibodies. The effect of rIFN-gamma to decrease CD4 expression was not due to a general loss of cell surface Ag, because the binding of OKM1 and anti-HLe-1 increased after rIFN-gamma treatment. Treatment of rIFN-gamma also decreased cell surface CD4 expression on the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, and on the monocytic cell line THP-1, although the extent of the decrease was less than on U937 cells. Freshly isolated normal peripheral blood monocytes treated for 48 h with rIFN-gamma bound much less OKT4 or OKT4A antibody than cells incubated in the absence of rIFN-gamma. Moreover, treatment with rIFN-gamma reduced the percentage of peripheral blood monocytes that were positive for the CD4 Ag. In contrast with the decrease in CD4 levels on rIFN-gamma-treated monocytes, treatment with rIFN-gamma had no effect on CD4 levels on peripheral blood T lymphocytes or T cell lines.","['Faltynek, C R', 'Finch, L R', 'Miller, P', 'Overton, W R']","['Faltynek CR', 'Finch LR', 'Miller P', 'Overton WR']","['Biological Carcinogenesis Development Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21701.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, HIV)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, HIV', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jan 15;142(2):500-8.,,,,,,,,,

Both the differentiation and the enhancement of PA activity in cultures of DMSO-induced cells were blocked by treating the cells with 1 microM dexamethasone. A highly significant correlation (rs = 0.93) was found between the number of hemoglobinized cells and the rate of PA secretion, indicating that the increase in PA activity coincides with late events of the differentiation process. FL cells specifically adhere to fibronectin-coated surfaces but tend to lose this property during the differentiation process.

The flanking breakpoints of SP3 and API are therefore useful for rapidly localizing new markers to the neurofibromatosis critical region, while the breakpoints of the two translocation patients provide unique opportunities for reverse genetic strategies to clone the NF1 gene.","['Ledbetter, D H', 'Rich, D C', ""O'Connell, P"", 'Leppert, M', 'Carey, J C']","['Ledbetter DH', 'Rich DC', ""O'Connell P"", 'Leppert M', 'Carey JC']","['Institute for Molecular Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],['HD20619/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1989 Jan;44(1):20-4.,,,,,,PMC1715462,,,

The use of this methodology to treat human tumors is currently thwarted by technological difficulties in applying the findings obtained with murine models to human disease. Two of these difficulties are described in this study. The first is that Imm+ variants lose most of their immunogenicity after treatment with X-irradiation or mitomycin C. The second is that mutagen-treated tumor cells must be cloned so as to select for Imm+ variants, for the presence of as few as 0.001 per cent tumorigenic cells within the bulk population will result in the failure of the protective effect of the Imm+ variants. Because of these and other difficulties with mutagen-induced Imm+ variants, we have developed a different approach to producing such variants using transfection of tumor cells with foreign genes. In contrast to mutagen induced Imm+ variants, these variants have been shown to retain their immunogenicity after X-irradiation.","['Sella, A', 'Hunt, B', 'Frost, P']","['Sella A', 'Hunt B', 'Frost P']","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['CA41525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Clin Exp Metastasis,Clinical & experimental metastasis,8409970,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02057184 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Metastasis. 1989 Jan-Feb;7(1):97-105. doi: 10.1007/BF02057184.,,,,,,,,,

The cyclical chemotherapy combined with surgery and radiotherapy gave very good results. However, the contribution of chemotherapy to paediatric neuro-oncology was not as great is it was to other branches of paediatric oncology (acute leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, Wilms' tumour). One of the reasons is that although brain tumours are usually solid in children the existence of different histological types contributes to the fact that they are not very frequent or are rare. Consequently, for many types the necessary number of representative controlled studies is lacking. On the other hand, the leading paediatric oncology associations in the world (Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG), International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and Paediatric Oncology Group (POG)) have applied the prospective clinical programmes of treatment of these tumours later than in other malignant diseases.

Rapid measurement of viability, such as can be achieved employing fluorescent probes of metabolic function in combination with instrumental analysis, is highly desirable. However, we observe that exposure to chemicals (of unrelated type) complicates the interpretation of viability data and, in the case of perturbed cells, questions the validity of viability growth assays based on intrinsic enzyme activity. Viability commonly is determined flow cytometrically (FCM) by the carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA)/propidium iodide (PI) assay. Nonfluorescent CFDA is taken up by diffusion and converted via cytoplasmic esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis to carboxyfluorescein (CF), a negatively charged fluorescent molecule that is retained (incompletely) by the cell. As such, if CF fluorescence intensity is a relative measure of enzyme activity, it also can be considered an index of cellular vigor (metabolic rate). It is generally accepted that the viable cell excludes both basic dyes, such as PI, and acidic dyes, such as trypan blue, and uptake is indicative of irreversible cellular injury presaging cell death. We observe that, following incubation for 4 h with 0.5-1.0 microM tributyltin (TBT), a potent environmental toxicant, murine erythroleukemic cells (MELC) exhibit enhanced (supranormal) CF fluorescence compared to control cells. Apparent cell volume (ACV) is unaltered, and because such cells exclude PI, they are considered viable in terms of the CFDA/PI assay. However, rate of growth (increase in cell number over 48 h) is depressed, suggesting that supranormal CF fluorescence, even in the absence of PI uptake, is indicative of cellular perturbation. In effect, although CF fluorescence is the product of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction and, therefore, an indicator of vital function (enzyme activity), it apparently is not a reliable index of cellular vigor. At higher TBT concentrations (greater than 1.0, but less than 50.0 microM), the cells exhibit both increased CF fluorescence and PI fluorescence and are growth inhibited. MELC exposed to the cancer chemotherapeutic agents adriamycin, m-AMSA, or crisnatol (Burroughs Wellcome 770U82) also exhibit increased cellular CF fluorescence. However, rate of growth is decreased and ACV increased.

The same band was also observed in analysis with a 5' DQ probe, a 5'-flanking sequence of DQ52, thus suggesting the use of DQ52. By analyzing EcoRI- and PvuII-digested genomic DNA, the above-observed band was demonstrated to be the result of DQ52-JH2 joining. This was further confirmed utilizing a T cell leukemia line with known DQ52-JH joinings. We then quantitatively estimated the frequencies of JH segment usages in joining with DQ52, through plaque hybridization assays. Three hundred and fifty JH4-positive clones were obtained from 7 x 10(5) plaques by plaque hybridization. Forty-eight randomly selected non-germline clones were purified and the use of JH segments was determined through Southern blot analysis. Nine clones used JH1, 29 used JH2, 9 used JH3, and 1 used JH4, thus indicating an apparent preferential usage of JH2 segment. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA of progenitor B cells in culture showed a dominant band of DQ52-JH2 joining 1 week after initiation of culture. This may indicate that the dominant DQ52-JH2 joining in thymocytes is representative of early D-J joinings in progenitor B cells.","['Suzuki, H', 'Abe, M', 'Nishikawa, S', 'Nakayama, E', 'Shiku, H']","['Suzuki H', 'Abe M', 'Nishikawa S', 'Nakayama E', 'Shiku H']","['Department of Oncology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/1.6.643 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1989;1(6):643-6. doi: 10.1093/intimm/1.6.643.,,,,,,,,,

Such genes would normally act to suppress the cancer phenotype at the cellular or organism level. The gene determining susceptibility to hereditary retinoblastoma (RB) appears to operate in exactly this fashion, and is the first cancer suppressor gene to be molecularly cloned. The RB gene contains 27 exons dispersed over more than 200 kb and ubiquitously expresses a 4.7 kb mRNA. From sequence analysis of RB cDNA clones, the predicted RB protein has 928 amino acids. The RB protein is a nuclear phosphoprotein capable of binding to DNA and forming a complex with oncoproteins of several DNA tumor viruses. Consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern, RB gene inactivation was found in many other cancers such as osteosarcoma, breast carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma and prostate carcinoma. A cloned RB gene was introduced, via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, into such tumor cells that have inactivated endogenous RB genes. Expression of the exogenous RB gene consistently suppressed their tumorigenicity in nude mice, suggesting that RB may act as a general cancer suppressor. In an attempt to address the potential cellular function of this gene, we have observed that RB protein phosphorylation oscillates with cell-cycle and the unphosphorylated form is present predominantly in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, when cells were induced to differentiate only the unphosphorylated form of RB could be detected, suggesting that RB protein was modulated through phosphorylation, may play an important role in these cellular functions. A hypothesis is proposed to explain how RB participates in cell proliferation and differentiation and its role in tumorigenesis.","['Lee, W H']",['Lee WH'],"['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],['EY05758/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Eye Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteosarcoma/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/physiology', 'Retinoblastoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1989;20:159-70.,,,,,,,,,

Primary rabbit corneal epithelial cell cultures were established, and the cells plated prior to each experiment. 3H-thymidine incorporation was measured after the addition of drug or vehicle to these confluent cells, and dose-response curves were generated. Marked inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation was reached at chemotherapeutic concentrations achieved clinically for cytosine arabinoside (10(-7) M), methotrexate (10(-3) M), and 5-fluorouracil (10(-6) M). A 10(-4) M concentration of 2-deoxycytidine, a naturally occurring competitive inhibitor of cytosine arabinoside, protected cells up to a concentration of 10(-5) M. We utilized these data to undertake an in vivo prophylaxis study in 13 leukemia patients receiving high-dose iv cytosine arabinoside. Topical deoxycytidine 10(-4) M and 1% prednisolone phosphate, given 12 hours prior to the start of antileukemic therapy, were effective in reducing symptoms and signs of keratitis; both were better than historical placebo-treated eyes. Ophthalmic preservatives were studied in vitro at concentrations used clinically: benzalkonium chloride (BAC) (0.004-0.02%) was the most toxic, thimerosal (TMS) (0.001-0.004%) intermediate, and chlorobutanol (CHB) (0.2-0.5%) the least toxic. Antiviral agents (final concentration) included: trifluridine (TFT) (1.0%), ethyldeoxuridine (EDU) (2.0%), and idoxuridine (IDU) (0.1%). Dose but not time-dependent concentrations of these 3 agents were noted to cause toxicity; however, (E)-5(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) (0.1%) was non-toxic. Similarly, tobramycin and amikacin were significantly less toxic than gentamicin and neomycin in this system. These in vitro cytotoxicity data correlate well with previous in vivo and pre-clinical corneal epithelial toxicity studies.

A review of the features of ALL patients seen in University College Hospital, Ibadan, during different periods over the past three decades revealed not only the predicted changes but also an increasing proportion of pediatric and female patients. Except for an unusual number of patients with the rare L3 morphological variant seen within the last 2 years, little else changed in the clinical and laboratory features of the disease. Atrophy of the thymus resulting from malnutrition is thought to inhibit the occurrence of common-ALL in the first decade of life. This inhibition is removed by improved nutrition, thus allowing more cases of common-ALL to develop in children. The trend in Nigeria has been observed earlier among Arabs in the Gaza Strip in the Sinai Peninsula. If the hypothesis is correct, undernutrition occurring for a long enough time in a previously well-nourished population should lead to changes opposite to those observed.

More and more institutions are initiating bone marrow transplant programs. During the 33-year period between 1955 and 1987, more than 20,000 patients received allogeneic bone marrow transplants; more than 50% of these were performed in the 3 years, 1985-1987. Transplantation is an effective therapy for acute leukemia; in some instances it is the preferred treatment. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, severe aplastic anemia, and some genetic and immune deficiency diseases, bone marrow transplantation provides the only possibility for cure. Bone marrow transplantation is associated with serious problems such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), graft failure, interstitial pneumonitis and, until recently, the requirement for an HLA-identical sibling donor. In the past few years, an increasing number of transplants have been performed using HLA-partially matched related or unrelated donors with some success, the level of which is yet to be determined. The development of acute GvHD (8) and interstitial pneumonitis (9, 10) can often be predicted by risk factor assessment. Special precautions can then be taken for patients at high risk of these complications.

These results must be adjusted with other risk factors such as age, sex mismatch, disease status, CMV serology, and GvHD. The use of donors who differ from genotypically matched related donors is currently under investigation. Mismatched related transplants give disappointing results except in the case of 1 HLA mismatch. Unrelated HLA-matched donor panels have recently been established in various countries with 200 transplants performed with a DFS of approximately 40%. Researchers are currently trying to reduce the RR by intensifying the conditioning regimen or using the graft-versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic T cells, reducing GvHD by the use of monoclonal antibodies, and improving the engraftment by the use of growth factors.

Our findings suggest that activation of viral and cellular gene expression by Tax is achieved through a cascade of events that involves multiple protein-protein associations and that the specificity of these associations is conferred through different domains of the Tax protein.","['Ruben, S M', 'Perkins, A', 'Rosen, C A']","['Ruben SM', 'Perkins A', 'Rosen CA']","['Department of Molecular Oncology and Virology, Roche Research Center, Nutley, NJ 07110.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,New Biol,The New biologist,9000976,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,New Biol. 1989 Dec;1(3):275-84.,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of orbital aspergillosis should include surgical reduction of the local fungal inoculum, supplementation of intravenous antifungal agents with local delivery to minimize systemic toxicity, and attempts to reverse the immunosuppression.

In the remaining ten patients, there were no detectable Ph1 chromosomes despite molecular evidence for the presence of rearrangements in the major breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of chromosome 22 in all cases. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to location of the breakpoints within the bcr. When these two groups of patients were combined, there was a significant excess of breakpoints in one segment of the bcr when compared to the distribution of breakpoints seen in 119 patients with simple 9;22 translocations. The difference in breakpoint distributions did not appear to be entirely attributable to differences between groups in disease duration at the time of study.

In addition the roughness coefficients (describing the summarized measure of contour folding of an individual cell) were calculated and computer evaluated. Cytoplasmic contour shape of smeared lymphocytes in the 6-10 harmonic range discriminates well between lymphocytes of healthy subjects and those of each CLL stage. This discrimination was the result of richer folding of CLL lymphocytes. Nuclear contour shape of lymphocytes in the 6-10 harmonic range fails to discriminate between lymphocytes of healthy subjects and those of CLL, but it discriminates well between lymphocytes of various stages of CLL, with the exception of stages I/II and III/IV. When Fourier analysis was carried out on lymphocytes of combined stages I + II and III + IV, the shape differences were even more accentuated.

A total of 771 leukaemias was studied, matched for age, sex, year of diagnosis and district of residence to 1,432 controls registered with a solid tumour excluding lymphoma; 231 general population controls aged 18 and over from one part of the study area were also used. The potential for residential exposure to power frequency magnetic fields from power-lines and transformer substations was assessed indirectly from the distance, type and loading of the equipment near each subject's residence. Only 0.6% of subjects lived within 100 m of an overhead power-line, and the risk of leukaemia relative to cancer controls for residence within 100 m was 1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-3.88); within 50 m the relative risk was 2.0 but with a wider confidence interval (95% CI 0.4-9.0). Over 40% of subjects lived within 100 m of a substation, for which the relative risk of leukaemia was 0.99. Residence within 25 m carried a risk of 1.3 (95% CI 0.8-2.0). Weighted exposure indices incorporating measures of the current load carried by the substations did not materially alter these risks estimates. For persons aged less than 18 the relative risk of leukaemia from residence within 50 m of a substation was higher than in adults (PR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.7-3.4).","['Coleman, M P', 'Bell, C M', 'Taylor, H L', 'Primic-Zakelj, M']","['Coleman MP', 'Bell CM', 'Taylor HL', 'Primic-Zakelj M']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Phenomena', 'England', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Power Plants', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1989.362 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1989 Nov;60(5):793-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1989.362.,,['Br J Cancer. 1990 Jun;61(6):942.

After transfer into murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) expression from the human beta-globin gene responds to inducers of erythroid maturation in parallel to the endogenous murine globin genes. After infection of human BFU-E, RNA expression from the virally-transferred beta-globin gene was measured at 2.5%-5% of the endogenous beta-globin level. The most improved globin vectors can transfer the human beta-globin gene into pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells in mouse bone marrow. Mice reconstituted with infected marrow show human beta-globin RNA and protein expression in peripheral blood cells for over 4 months. In these animals, both myeloid and lymphoid cells carry the integrated provirus at a level of about 1 copy per cell. In serial transplantation experiments, bone marrow from these animals is capable of repopulating secondary and tertiary recipient animals which go on to show long-term human beta-globin expression. Retroviral vectors thus provide a practical way to refine models of globin gene regulation through in vivo tests and to evaluate the feasibility of protocols for gene addition therapy.","['Gelinas, R E', 'Bender, M A', 'Miller, A D', 'Novak, U']","['Gelinas RE', 'Bender MA', 'Miller AD', 'Novak U']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['CA-30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-37073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4613-0623-8_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1989;271:135-48. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-0623-8_15.,,,,,,,,,

Among leukemia patients, those with AML, ALL, ATL or CLL had various plasma fibronectin levels that were higher in some cases, while lower in others, as compared to normal control values. An elevation of the fibronectin level was noted often in APL, while lower fibronectin values were observed in many instances of CML. In these types of leukemia, acute exacerbation as well as supervention of infection tended to be associated with lower than normal levels of fibronectin. An especially marked depression of fibronectin occurred, when leukemia was complicated by sepsis or DIC, in which a good parallel was noted between the progress of disease and the fibronectin level. In lymphoproliferative diseases, the fibronectin value varied widely, but low fibronectin levels were frequently associated with intercurrent infection or an extreme deterioration of the general physical conditions.","['Kageyama, T', 'Ohyabu, H', 'Ohshiba, S']","['Kageyama T', 'Ohyabu H', 'Ohshiba S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Bull Osaka Med Coll,Bulletin of the Osaka Medical College,8917028,['0 (Fibronectins)'],IM,"['Fibronectins/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Osaka Med Coll. 1989 Nov;35(1-2):71-6.,,,,,,,,,

This hypothesis was derived from the following observations: 1. Exposure of the MELC to micromolar concentrations of TBT results in increased resistance to detergent-mediated cytolysis; 2. Exposure of porcine renal microsomal membrane preparations to similar concentrations results in inhibition of vanadate-mediated crystallization of Na+,K(+)-ATPase, a process requiring protein mobility within the membrane; 3. Flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopic analyses indicate that MELC exposed to submicromolar concentrations of TBT exhibit increased cellular carboxyfluorescein retention; and 4. Nuclei prepared from TBT-treated cells by detergent-mediated cytolysis exhibit increased axial light loss, 90 degrees light scatter, fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence, and the presence of adherent proteinaceous tags. The DNA distribution histogram of such nuclei also is perturbed.","['Massaro, E J', 'Zucker, R M', 'Elstein, K H', 'Ting-Beall, H P', 'Easterling, R E']","['Massaro EJ', 'Zucker RM', 'Elstein KH', 'Ting-Beall HP', 'Easterling RE']","['Developmental and Cell Toxicology Division, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Trialkyltin Compounds)', '3301-79-9 (6-carboxyfluorescein)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '4XDX163P3D (tributyltin)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Crystallization', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Ethanol', 'Fluoresceins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Swine', 'Trialkyltin Compounds/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02917268 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 1989 Jul-Sep;21:305-12. doi: 10.1007/BF02917268.,,,,,,,,,

The maximal expression level (greater than 80% positive cells) obtained with FK plus IL-1 or FK plus TNF alpha could not be obtained by increasing the concentration of either agent alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Tac protein expression is correlated with increased steady-state Tac mRNA levels. Other agents that increase intracellular cAMP, such as prostaglandin E (PGE) or isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX), also synergized with IL-1 or TNF alpha (but not with FK). The findings suggest that cAMP plays a role in regulating Tac expression in YT cells, and that IL-1, TNF, and FK use distinct signal transduction mechanisms, all resulting in the same end point effect, namely, induction of Tac mRNA and cell surface protein expression.","['Scholz, W', 'Altman, A']","['Scholz W', 'Altman A']","['Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['AR-35411/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Prostaglandins E/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0898-6568(89)90055-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0898-6568(89)90055-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 1989;1(4):367-75. doi: 10.1016/0898-6568(89)90055-7.,,,,,,,,,

The increase in tumour mass occurred within 6 months of starting treatment. At surgery, four patients were found to have differentiated teratoma and have been followed for 15 months to 5 years without relapse. Two patients who also had some areas of embryonal carcinoma in the resected specimens had post-operative chemotherapy and are alive disease free at 8 and 24 months respectively. Two patients died: one post-operatively of uncontrolled haemorrhage secondary to aortic rupture and the second of acute myeloid leukaemia following 8 years of intermittent therapy for unresectable differentiated teratoma.

This is similar to other ""inhibitory"" treatments (i.e., treatments that result in sub-optimal hemoglobin production) that have been previously reported. Therefore, although benzyl alcohol and dexamethasone both partly inhibit the induction of total hemoglobin production, they have opposite effects on the induced hemoglobin phenotype: benzyl alcohol decreases the hemoglobin minor/hemoglobin major ratio while dexamethasone increases it. The mechanism(s) of the alteration in the hemoglobin phenotype is unknown as is the mechanism of induction by any of the various inducing agents or of the inhibition of induction by any treatment. However, it appears that if the signal for the induction of hemoglobin minor is sufficiently potent (as it is during butyrate or hemin induction), it cannot be overcome by benzyl alcohol at a ""non-toxic"" concentration.","['Scher, W', 'Scher, B M', 'Hellinger, N', 'Waxman, S']","['Scher W', 'Scher BM', 'Hellinger N', 'Waxman S']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Benzyl Alcohols)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9087-70-1 (Aprotinin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'LKG8494WBH (Benzyl Alcohol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aprotinin/pharmacology', 'Benzyl Alcohol', 'Benzyl Alcohols/*pharmacology', 'Benzyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 1989 Jul-Sep;3(3):91-7.,,,,,,,,,

When K562 cells were irradiated with X-rays and cultured for 18 hours, they showed increased sensitivity to lysis by blood lymphocytes and purified large granular lymphocytes (LGL). The X-ray-induced augmentation was observed as little as 2 Gy irradiation, reaching maximum at 5 to 20 Gy. The doses of X-rays did not influence the viability and spontaneous release of the target cells. On the other hand, irradiation with X-rays of NK cells at 5 to 15 Gy resulted in a transient increase in NK activity at 1 hour, and then the activity declined and was completely lost after 24 hours. However, when LGL were cultured with interferon immediately after irradiation, they maintained elevated NK activity. These results suggest the possible use of low doses of X-ray irradiation in combination with biological response modifiers for treatment of cancer.","['Uchida, A', 'Mizutani, Y', 'Nagamuta, M', 'Ikenaga, M']","['Uchida A', 'Mizutani Y', 'Nagamuta M', 'Ikenaga M']","['Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*radiation effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08923978909005381 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 1989;11(2-3):507-19. doi: 10.3109/08923978909005381.,,,,,,,,,

Alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) alone has clearly a substantial antitumoral effect in many hematological diseases. During the coming decade an improved effect will probably be seen by combination of alpha-IFN with cytostatics and other biologic therapeutics as well as by finding the optimal conditions when alpha-IFN should be used. Using unconjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAb) only, an overall response rate of 38% was noted in patients with advanced disease. MAb therapy might be improved by using other Ig molecules, combination with cytokines and by finding an optimal dosage schedule. Only a few patients with hematological malignancies have been treated with IL-2/LAK cells. An overall response rate of 41% was seen in heavily pretreated patients. In all biologic therapeutics, an improved efficacy will be noted if patients with a low tumor burden and an intact immune system are treated. Immunization/vaccination with ""tumor antigen"" will probably contribute to an improved prognosis, especially in patients with minimal residual disease. There are several good candidates to be used as tumor antigens in hematological malignancies i.e. the idiotypic receptors on T and B cells. Biotherapy in hematological tumors has come to stay.

It is now shown that the cross-reactive antigenic epitope shared by these three molecules is determined solely by the protein portion of these glycoproteins, and that the N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate moieties of these glycoproteins do not directly or sterically contribute to the antigenic cross-reactivity. When CD46 molecules (mol.wt = 66 and 56 kDa) from human thymocytes were stripped of sialic acid with neuraminidase, or stripped of N-linked carbohydrate with endoglycosidase F, the E4.3 MoAb was still able to bind and immunoprecipitate the protein core of CD46 (mol.wt = 56 and 44 kDa). Similarly, polyclonal antisera to GaLV and MPMV precipitated deglycosylated CD46, although at a reduced efficiency. The cross-reacting E4.3 MoAb, anti-GaLV and anti-MPMV antisera also immunoprecipitated HuLy-m5 primary translation protein lacking N- or O-linked carbohydrate from the in vitro translation products of human thymocyte mRNA. Thus, the antigenic cross-reactivity of CD46 molecules with GaLV gp70 and MPMV gp70 is both specific and due to protein structure rather than to carbohydrate; the findings suggest that retroviruses may have acquired a functional epitope from human CD46 or that an endogenous retroviral sequence of human may partially or completely encode the CD46 antigen.","['Purcell, D F', 'Deacon, N J', 'McKenzie, I F']","['Purcell DF', 'Deacon NJ', 'McKenzie IF']","['Department of Pathology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic., Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Mcp protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (lentil lectin)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cross Reactions', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase', '*Plant Lectins', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1989.42 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1989 Oct;67 ( Pt 5):279-89. doi: 10.1038/icb.1989.42.,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that the contribution of RNA to total nucleic acid content of the soluble fraction should be taken into consideration when nuclei are digested with low concentrations of MNase.","['Telford, D J', 'Stewart, B W']","['Telford DJ', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Unit, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Int J Biochem,The International journal of biochemistry,0250365,"['0 (Chromatin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Liver/ultrastructure', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retinoblastoma', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0020-711x(89)90009-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Biochem. 1989;21(11):1235-40. doi: 10.1016/0020-711x(89)90009-8.,,,,,,,,,

Incubations were designed in such a way that the intracellular concentrations of cytostatic drugs in vitro paralleled those in vivo. Leukemic cells were isolated from 53 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. 13 of these patients died early due to supportive care failure and were not evaluable for the predictive drug testing. Of the remaining 40 patients, 25 entered a complete remission (CR) and 15 had a resistant disease (RD). According to the patients randomization to therapy the cells were incubated with anthracyclines and Ara-C separately and in combination. After 4 days of culturing in liquid medium the in vitro cytotoxicity was determined by dye exclusion according to Weisenthal. The cytotoxic effect in vitro was significantly higher on cells from patients who achieved a CR compared to patients with RD after incubations with anthracyclines 0.2 mumol/l (p less than or equal to 0.005), Ara-C 0.5 mumol/l (p less than or equal to 0.05) and with the combination of anthracyclines with Ara-C (p less than or equal to 0.0005). The best predictive value was achieved when incubations with 0.2 mumol/l anthracyclines and 0.5 mumol/l Ara-C were analyzed together. With these incubations cells from 20 out of 21 patients who achieved CR showed either less than or equal to 60% surviving cells after the anthracycline incubation or less than or equal to 35% surviving cells after the Ara-C incubation. Cells from 11 out of 13 patients with RD did not fulfill either of these criteria. In vitro drug sensitivity was significantly correlated to a prolonged survival (p less than 0.01). We conclude that, when performed with incubations that mimic in vivo tumor cell exposure to cytostatic drugs, the DiSC assay shows a high correlation to clinical outcome for patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia.","['Tidefelt, U', 'Sundman-Engberg, B', 'Rhedin, A S', 'Paul, C']","['Tidefelt U', 'Sundman-Engberg B', 'Rhedin AS', 'Paul C']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00323.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1989 Nov;43(5):374-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00323.x.,,,,,,,,,

Northern hybridization of RNA from B10.S liver and its hybrid with NZB showed that the suppression of gp70 in Sgp-1c carrying mice can be regulated at the transcriptional level. However, the inheritance of this trait shows the complicated manner of segregation in certain crosses. All (B10.S x NZB) F1 hybrid mice and F1 x B10.S back-cross mice had low amounts of serum gp70 and did not respond to LPS with increased levels of serum gp70. In contrast, F1 x NZB back-cross progeny varied widely in serum gp70 levels. The serum gp70 levels of most F1 x NZB back-cross mice was increased by LPS, although the range of increases was broad. These results indicate that the Sgp-1c alone is not sufficient to lower serum gp70 levels, unless B10 background is present.

The incidence of CD7 positively was particularly significant in the less differentiated subtypes M0 and M1 compared with other FAB groups (P less than 0.001). In all cases the myeloid determinants CD13 and/or CD33 were associated with CD7 expression.

Among these, one out of five co-expressing TdT showed IgH rearrangement when analysed at the DNA level. Clinical features at presentation and response to induction therapy did not allow us to consider CD7+ AML patients as a distinct subgroup with prognostic significance. Our data indicate that CD7 expression is a common finding in immature AML, being generally found in the absence of other T-cell features.

However, interpretation of the experimental data has been complicated by potential methodological pitfalls. To establish the role of these factors in B-CLL growth, we investigated their stimulatory effects under accurately defined in vitro conditions. Purified B-CLL cells were obtained by fluorescence activated cell sorting on the basis of coexpression of CD5 and CD19/CD20/CD24 surface antigens in order to avoid interference of normal cell contamination. Subsequently, the cells were cultured free of serum. TNFs alpha and beta and BCGF induced DNA synthesis in the purified B-CLL cells in five out of six cases, as assessed by 3H-thymidine (TdR) uptake on days 3 and 6 of culture. The stimulating activity of BCGF could be suppressed by the addition of specific anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, indicating that the BCGF activity had been, to a major extent, due to the presence of TNFs in this impure preparation. IL-2, when added as a single stimulus, induced DNA synthesis in the B-CLL cells in three out of six cases on day 3, but not on day 6 of culture. In some patients, cooperative effects of IL-2 and TNF were observed. Cytogenetic analysis was applied to confirm the CLL origin of the proliferating cells. The phorbol ester TPA or anti-IgM were not required for induction of DNA synthesis in the CLL cells, although TPA potentiated 3H-TdR uptake in three out of six cases, and anti-IgM in one case. Our data demonstrate that IL-2 and TNFs alpha and beta can act as growth factors for B-CLL cells under fully defined in vitro conditions, essentially without the need of TPA or anti-IgM as primary activation signals.","['Moberts, R', 'Hoogerbrugge, H', 'van Agthoven, T', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I']","['Moberts R', 'Hoogerbrugge H', 'van Agthoven T', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw I']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(89)90004-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(89)90004-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(11):973-80. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90004-0.,,,,,,,,,

A reduced bone marrow and spleen content of leukemic colony-forming cells (L-CFU) was observed in rhG-CSF-treated recipients in comparison with control recipients.

In the G-CSF group the WBC count at nadir was higher than in other groups, and neutrophil recovery preceded monocyte recovery. After the discontinuation of G-CSF, the WBC count first decreased for a few days and then increased again slowly. The short duration of leukopenia brought about a reduction in the number of febrile (greater than 38 degrees C) days which, until day 30, were 1.8 +/- 1.9 in the G-CSF group, also significantly shorter than in others. Acute graft-versus-host disease (greater than grade II) appeared in two of eight patients from the G-CSF group, this incidence being comparable to those found in the other groups.

Interferons have both direct antitumor activity and extensive effects on the immune system. Two recombinant interferon alfa products--interferon alfa-2a and interferon alfa-2b are available commercially. Indications in FDA-approved labeling for interferon alfa include the treatment of hairy-cell leukemia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and genital warts; however, it also is being used successfully against early chronic myelogenous leukemia, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and previously untreated multiple myeloma. Other malignancies that respond to treatment with interferon alfa are malignant melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. The toxic pattern of interferon alfa consists of flu-like symptoms, which are seen at all doses, on all schedules, and in virtually all patients. After repeated dosing, the chronic toxicities of anorexia, weight loss, and malaise and fatigue may develop. Myelosuppression, central nervous system toxicity, increased hepatic enzyme concentrations, nausea and vomiting, and cardiovascular toxicity also are possible. Serum neutralizing antibodies may be formed during therapy; this phenomenon may affect the clinical outcome. Numerous BRMs are being investigated for clinical use, and pharmacists must become conversant in the issues that surround these agents. Areas in which pharmacist involvement and knowledge are important include overall cost, product similarities and differences, dosing and scheduling, drug delivery systems, ways to minimize waste, adverse effects and their management, drug interactions, storage requirements, differences in production and purification techniques among manufacturers, and education of patients and staff.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Koeller, J M']",['Koeller JM'],"['College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hosp Pharm,American journal of hospital pharmacy,0370474,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*genetics/immunology', 'Interferon Type I/*genetics/immunology', 'Interferons/genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hosp Pharm. 1989 Nov;46(11 Suppl 2):S11-5.,14,,,,,,,,

With this method, the amplification products of both hnRNA (containing the introns) and mature mRNA can be detected on Southern blots with appropriate hybridization probes. With the experimental conditions used, the sensitivity of the technique is such that TK mRNA can be detected in as few as 20 S-phase cells. TK hnRNA is maximally expressed early in the S phase of the cell cycle after quiescent human fibroblasts are stimulated to proliferate. At this point, the ratio of TK hnRNA to TK mRNA is 1:155.

To identify more effective target sequences, helper-free retrovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to introduce antisense RNAs complementary to multiple functional regions of the human creatine kinase B (CK-B) mRNA into U937 cells. Antisense RNA complementary to the last third of the coding and all of the noncoding regio of this mRNA is highly effective; one or two antisense transcripts is sufficient to block the expression of one CK-B mRNA. In contrast, antisense RNA from which sequences complementary to the last 17 codons and all the 3' noncoding region have been deleted has no effect on CK-B expression. Neither antisense RNA alters the abundance of the target message, processing of the primary transcript, egress of the CK-B message from the nucleus, or the polysome profile of CK-B mRNA in sucrose gradients. These results point to a direct effect of the antisense transcript on translation and suggest that this effect may be explained at least in part by an inhibition of elongation or termination as a consequence of the duplex formed in the distal coding and/or 3' noncoding region.","[""Ch'ng, J L"", 'Mulligan, R C', 'Schimmel, P', 'Holmes, E W']","[""Ch'ng JL"", 'Mulligan RC', 'Schimmel P', 'Holmes EW']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],"['GM34366/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA47631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03DK39715/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Creatine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/*genetics', 'RNA, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.24.10006 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Dec;86(24):10006-10. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.24.10006.,,,,,,PMC298631,,,

In contrast, rhIL3 marginally enhanced mRNA coding for IL3, GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL 1 beta and counteracted the inhibitory effect of IL4. In long-term cultures rhIL3 and rhIL4 had no significant effect on spontaneous cytokine gene expression of myelogenous leukemia-derived peripheral blood or BM cells, but made these cells more sensitive for subsequent stimulation with different polyclonal stimuli. Thus, IL3 and IL4 already modulate cytokine gene expression during the initiation of cell culture and differentiate BM cells into populations of cells which are capable of responding with an enhanced cytokine gene expression after polyclonal stimulation.","['Brantschen, S', 'Gauchat, J F', 'De Weck, A L', 'Stadler, B M']","['Brantschen S', 'Gauchat JF', 'De Weck AL', 'Stadler BM']","['Institute of Clinical Immunology, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/genetics', 'Cytokines', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/genetics', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'RNA Probes', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830191108 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Nov;19(11):2017-23. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830191108.,,,,,,,,,

Conditioned medium of spleen or bone marrow cells had low GI activity. Pulmonary macrophages were as active as peritoneal and bone-marrow-derived macrophages in production of the GI activity. The GI factor inhibited the growth of murine monocytic leukemia cell lines Mm-A and J774.1, but scarcely inhibited the growth of other mouse cell lines, such as a myeloblastic leukemia cell line (M1), a Friend erythroleukemia cell line (745A) and a mammary carcinoma cell line (FM3A).

The GI factor was found to be a proteinaceous substance with a molecular mass of 25 kDa. On chromatofocusing, the GI activity was eluted with Polybuffer 96/acetic acid at pH 7.2-7.5. The GI activity was not significantly decreased by heat treatment at 56 degrees C for 30 min or acid treatment (0.01 M HCl, 14 h), but the GI activity in glycosidase-treated conditioned medium of lung tissue was lost on heat treatment. The GI activity could not be neutralized with anti-(interferon alpha + beta) antibody. The activity was produced constitutively by lung tissues and its production was not stimulated appreciably by lipopolysaccharide, lectin, or poly(I).poly(C). The GI factor appears to be a cytokine unrelated to known cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, transforming growth factor beta, and interferons.

The growth of syngeneic solid tumors (Meth-A fibrosarcoma and RL male 1 leukemia) inoculated into BALB/c mice was suppressed after one treatment with SMANCS at doses ranging from 0.14 mg/kg to 3.4 mg/kg i.v. 24 h before tumor implantation. Since previously observations concerning SMANCS have shown that it disappeared within 1.5 h after i.v. administration in mice and that it was inactivated quickly in plasma, SMANCS evidently inhibited tumor growth by mediating non-specific resistance. In addition, the non-specific resistance to tumors stimulated by SMANCS could be passively transferred to untreated mice by serum which was shown to contain interferon (IFN) from 12 h to 20 h after SMANCS administration. However, the resistance was not produced by serum prepared from mice at 8 h or 32 h after administration presumably because of the observation that the interferon activity was only demonstrated from 12 h to 28 h after SMANCS stimulation. When the serum specimens were treated with anti-IFN-gamma antiserum, the antitumor activity of the sera was abrogated. However, no significant change was detected in the antitumor activity of the specimens following treatment with anti-IFN-alpha/beta antiserum. Treatment of mice with SMANCS and anti-IFN-gamma antiserum together resulted in the elimination of the non-specific resistance to tumors. The IFN induced in the sera of mice by SMANCS was shown to be 57% IFN-gamma and 41% IFN-alpha/beta. Half of the interferon produced in SMANCS-stimulated mice could be eliminated by treatment with anti-IFN-gamma, and treatment of SMANCS-stimulated mice with both anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IFN-alpha/beta antisera resulted in a total absence of detectable interferon. These findings suggest that while the administration of SMANCS induces both IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta production, in this case, it is only the former which mediates the non-specific resistance to tumors.","['Suzuki, F', 'Pollard, R B', 'Maeda, H']","['Suzuki F', 'Pollard RB', 'Maeda H']","['Department of Microbiology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Maleic Anhydrides)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (poly(maleic acid-styrene)neocarzinostatin)', '54991-66-1 (poly(styrene-co-maleic acid)butyl ester)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', '9014-02-2 (Zinostatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/*drug effects', 'Interferons/immunology/physiology', 'Male', 'Maleates/pharmacology', 'Maleic Anhydrides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Polystyrenes/*pharmacology', 'Zinostatin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01665960 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1989;30(2):97-104. doi: 10.1007/BF01665960.,,,,,,,,,

Biochem. Pharmac. 38, 4037 (1989)]. To determine the enzymes inhibited, triciribine phosphate (TCN-P, NSC-280594) was tested in dialyzed extracts of the cells. A new assay for glycinamide ribotide (GAR) synthesis was based on incorporation of [14C]glycine into GAR as a ribose-containing compound retained on boronyl gel columns. Glutamine, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), ATP and glycine were required for the two-step sequence of glutamine:amidophosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.14) and phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase (EC 6.3.4.13). When PRPP was near the normal intracellular concentration (0.1 mM), 1.2 mM TCN-P inhibited GAR synthesis by 71-95%. To permit separate assay of the ligase step, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine was used to inhibit amidophosphoribosyltransferase and phosphoribosylamine (PRA) was supplied in situ by chemical reaction of ribose-5-phosphate and ammonia (as ammonium acetate). The ligase was not inhibited by TCN-P. Thus, TCN-P inhibits amidophosphoribosyltransferase; it acts as an analog of the purine nucleotides which regulate this first committed step of de novo purine biosynthesis by an allosteric feedback mechanism. The measured intracellular concentration (0.1 mM) of PRPP was not changed in cells treated with TCN. IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205), the first de novo step committed to guanosine nucleotide synthesis, was also tested. It was inhibited by TCN-P, competitively with IMP, 66% at 1.2 mM TCN-P and 8 microM IMP. The degree of inhibition of these two enzymes was sufficient to account for the effects on purine nucleotide biosynthesis observed in intact cells treated with TCN.","['Moore, E C', 'Hurlbert, R B', 'Boss, G R', 'Massia, S P']","['Moore EC', 'Hurlbert RB', 'Boss GR', 'Massia SP']","['Medical Oncology Department, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['CA 34204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Acenaphthenes)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '10074-18-7 (glycineamide ribonucleotide)', '5L5GE3DV88 (triciribine phosphate)', '7540-64-9 (Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.14 (Amidophosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.13 (phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Acenaphthenes', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amidophosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Glycine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Pentosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/metabolism', 'Purine Nucleotides/*biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleotides/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(89)90685-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90685-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Nov 15;38(22):4045-51. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90685-0.,,,,,,,,,

Our objective in this paper was to compare these effects in intact cells of a human cell line as a prerequisite to describing in a companion paper [Moore et al., Biochem. Pharmac. 38, 4045 (1989)] more detailed enzymic studies of their interrelationships. TCN treatment inhibited cloning of CCRF-CEM human leukemic lymphoblasts 50% at concentrations of 6, 30, and 90 microM with 8-day, 8-hr, and 2-hr exposures respectively. However, 6-20% of the cells survived exposure to 200 microM TCN for 24 hr. The intracellular formation of TCN-P from TCN was rapid, concentrative and essentially complete, but TCN-P did not exceed about 1.4 mM (1.4 nmol/10(6) cells) at 200 microM TCN. In cells exposed to 50 microM TCN for 1.25 to 24 hr, formate incorporation into ATP and GTP was inhibited the most rapidly and strongly; pools of ATP and GTP were decreased as much as 40% (as compared with controls); and incorporation of formate into RNA purines was inhibited as much as 65%. Incorporation of leucine into protein was more moderately inhibited up to 40%, apparently in proportion to the concentration of intracellular TCN-P, rather than of the TCN in the medium. These inhibitions occurred most rapidly during the first 2-4 hr and increased only gradually thereafter, whereas cloning ability was inhibited more slowly and uniformly over a longer time period. No one of these metabolic effects by itself showed a clear correlation with the loss of viability. The incorporation of formate into formylglycinamide ribotide (FGAR, when accumulated at a blockage by azaserine) was inhibited drastically by TCN. The rate of incorporation of hypoxanthine into ATP was increased by TCN, whereas incorporation into GTP was decreased. Thus, the principal sites of inhibition of purine synthesis by TCN-P were shown in these intact cells to be at a step prior to synthesis of FGAR in the de novo pathway and also at an additional site between IMP and GTP.","['Moore, E C', 'Hurlbert, R B', 'Massia, S P']","['Moore EC', 'Hurlbert RB', 'Massia SP']","['Medical Oncology Department, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['CA 34204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Formates)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0YIW783RG1 (formic acid)', '2421HMY9N6 (triciribine)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '349-34-8 (phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Formates/metabolism', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(89)90684-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90684-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Nov 15;38(22):4037-44. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90684-9.,,,,,,,,,

Two are located 5' of the gene, one between -1349 and -1094, and the other between -384 and +52. Each of the two introns has a binding region, +184 to +284 and +930 to +1209. The fifth binding region is within the A gamma globin gene enhancer, a 750 bp Hind III fragment located 3' to the gene. The nuclear factors which bind to any or all of these regions may be important for control of regulation of the A gamma globin gene. Since HPFH point mutations occur at -175, -196 and -202, we investigated K562 nuclear factor binding to this region more closely. Footprints were obtained for two binding sites, one from -168 to -185 (site II) and the other from -267 to -293 (site I). Site II contains an octamer sequence (ATGCAAAT) important for protein binding and expression of the histone H2b and immunoglobulin genes. The HPFH mutation at -175 changes the T in the octamer sequence to a C. Site I is upstream of the bases affected by HPFH mutations. A A gamma globin gene promoter - CAT reporter fusion gene was constructed with a clustered - base substitution of site I or a T----C point mutation at -175. The mutation in site I decreases CAT expression 20X compared to wild-type in erythroid and non-erythroid cells. Site I probably binds a positive regulator. The T----C change at -175 increases expression 2-3X over wild-type in erythroid cells, but not in non-erythroid cells. This increase correlates with the effect of the naturally occurring HPFH, and may result from decreased binding of a negative effector, and/or increased positive factor binding.","['Lloyd, J A', 'Lee, R F', 'Menon, A G', 'Lingrel, J B']","['Lloyd JA', 'Lee RF', 'Menon AG', 'Lingrel JB']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0524.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Thalassemia/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1989;316A:139-48.,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, cells treated with PC-KLH alone were able to process the Ag and present it to T cells as shown by subsequent lymphokine production. Thus, both Ag and IL-5 used singly appear to interact with their respective receptors, although neither Ag nor IL-5 increased mu-mRNA levels when used singly. The production of increased mu-mRNA levels obtained with Ag plus IL-5 required polymerase II transcription, suggesting that they may act to increase Ig transcription directly.","['Webb, C F', 'Das, C', 'Coffman, R L', 'Tucker, P W']","['Webb CF', 'Das C', 'Coffman RL', 'Tucker PW']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)', 'FV4Y0JO2CX (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Haptens/*immunology', 'Hemocyanins/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-5/*pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylcholine/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Dec 15;143(12):3934-9.,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemical analysis with Astra blue-eosin dual staining revealed that all types of colonies consisted of various proportions of basophils, eosinophils, and hybrid (eosinophilic and basophilic) granulocytes which contained both of granules. These hybrid granulocytes were also identified by the ultrastructural features of two kinds of the granules. Relationships between cell numbers added to culture and formed colony numbers indicated colony of the cells to form the colonies. The colonies formed from untreated patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) during chronic phase were sevenfold of those from healthy volunteers. The colonies formed from treated patients with CML were normal in number. The number was 40 times greater in culture from a patient with basophilic crisis and a patient with myeloid crisis than normal, whereas that from a patient with lymphoid crisis were within normal limit. The number of the colonies from PBMC of patients with eosinophilia were in normal range, whereas those from bone marrow were six times or more than those from PBMC. These findings suggest that PBMC contains common basophil-eosinophil progenitors, and the culture used in this study in considered to be useful in the examination of basophil and eosinophil production from PBMC. Further studies using more purified cell population and other sources of colony stimulating factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor should be carried out in order to clarify the significance of hybrid granulocytes in basophil and eosinophil proliferation and differentiation.","['Musashi, M']",['Musashi M'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basophils/*cytology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eosinophilia/blood', 'Eosinophils/*cytology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Staining and Labeling']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1989 Sep;64(5):567-79.,,,,,,,,,

Pretransplant conditioning consisted of single-dose irradiation combined with a high-dose, short-term chemotherapy. Reactions of the endocrine system showed a defined temporary order. Changes of ACTH and cortisol were in the beginning. The pituitary-adrenal cortex system responds in a different way. The pituitary-thyroid system develop a short-term ""low-T3-syndrome"" reflecting the extreme stress of the organism. At the same time we obtained an increase of thyroxine. Testosterone and luteotropic hormone, the sexual steroids showed levels representing a primary gonadal insufficiency.

The results can be summarized as follows: 1. The extent of hormonal derangements is primarily dependent on the extent of irradiation prior to BMT. Integrity of hormonal systems was found in cases without irradiation (SAA) or if TBI did not exceed 3 Gy. 2. Primary hypogonadism was present in 18 patients. 3. Primary hypothyroidism was present in 2 patients. 4. Growth impairment was observed in 8 patients. In four of these cases growth hormone deficiency was the cause. In four other cases with graft-versus-host-disease and hepatic involvement SmC/IGF I levels were severely diminished.

At first after BMT the lymphocyte and T cell counts went to normal between 4-18 weeks post transplant, about 4 weeks earlier in autologous than in allogeneic BMT. T suppressor cells showed an early increase compared to T helper cells which normalized much slower about 6 months after BMT. Lymphoblastic responses, however, tended to normal not before the second half of the first year both in autologous and allogeneic transplantation. Skin test reactivity became normal during the 2nd and 3rd year posttransplant, which was more complete in autologous than in allogeneic BMT. The IgG and IgM levels were depressed for half a year and IgA levels for 2 years. The most striking aspect was the multiphase course of lymphoblastic response in every individual patient.

We used a dose rate of about 5.5 cGy/min delivered by a linear accelerator. The results were comparable with other centres but a further indicator for the effectiveness of a irradiation technique is also the idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis (IIP). Our incidence of IIP was 10.7 per cent and the mortality was 2.4 per cent. Additional we have had 8.3 per cent interstitial pneumonitis (IP) caused by an infection. All patients with a combination of IP and GVHD had a fatal prognosis.

Nevertheless, there are still many questions open. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia children should normally be grafted in 2nd remission (CR). Some high risk cases, however, should probably be grafted in 1st CR. It is not clear whether children with late relapses benefit more from BMT than from renewed chemotherapy. Children with a relapse during maintenance therapy, however, have a better survival rate with BMT. In acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia certain high risk patients should be grafted in 1st CR but it has still to be shown that BMT is superior to chemotherapy in such cases. It is not clear whether children with a relapse following intensive chemotherapy (such as the BFM-protocols) will benefit from BMT at all. In chronic myelocytic leukaemia, BMT in chronic phase should be performed. Thus, for the first time cure has become possible for this disease. Waiting for acceleration or even the occurrence of a blast crisis decreases the chance of survival after BMT dramatically.

Such a post-transcriptional control was governed by the induced synthesis of an RNA species (inRNA). In an attempt to find a potential candidate for such a function, we have localized the post-transcriptional regulation of p53 mRNA in the nuclear compartment of the cells; the various fragments of the p53 gene were used as probes for induced RNA(s) susceptible to interacting with p53 pre-mRNA. This experimental approach allowed for the identification of a nuclear RNA molecule, approximately 1.3 kb long, which was recognized specifically by a PstI-HindIII fragment located in the 5' part of the first intervening sequence of the p53 gene. This RNA accumulated when cell were treated by the inducer concomitantly with high mol.wt p53 mRNA precursors. However this RNA was not a maturation product of p53 pre-mRNA as evidenced by its antisense orientation with respect to this RNA. Moreover it was markedly enriched in the poly(A)+ fraction. The complementary part of inRNA in the p53 gene has been sequenced over approximately 1200 bp; no extensive homology was found in gene data banks but three restricted areas of the sequence were found homologous to a limited number of genes; they were themselves partially homologous to known repetitive sequences.

The present study examined the cellular metabolism and the effect on DNA methylation of ara-AC in human CCRF/CEM cells sensitive and resistant to ara-C. The triphosphate anabolite of the drug, ara-ACTP, was the major anabolite in the CEM cellular extracts, peaking at 50.6 +/- 23 microM 4 h after incubation with IC50 concentrations (0.25 microM) of [3H]ara-AC. The mono- and diphosphate anabolites accumulated 10-fold lower cellular concentrations than ara-ACTP. The nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) pools and, especially, cellular ATP declined significantly by 9 h after the initiation of drug treatment and remained depleted for the 24-h treatment. The drug anabolite was gradually incorporated into both RNA and DNA, peaking in CEM/0 at 3.44 and 0.14 nmol/10(7) cells, respectively. The DNA methylation levels in these cells declined rapidly after treatment with ara-AC, attaining a nadir plateau at 29% of control methylation value. The deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) mutant CEM cell line [CEM/dCk(-)] neither activated ara-AC at appreciable levels nor induced DNA hypomethylation at low concentrations (0.25-1 microM). However, the drug was activated at 0.2-1 microM extracellular concentrations of ara-AC, probably by an as yet unknown nucleoside kinase at approximately 10% of the amount in CEM/0 cells. Ara-AC appears to mediate its cytotoxic action through the accumulation of its triphosphate anabolite, ara-ACTP, and the subsequent incorporation into nucleic acids. DNA methylation may also contribute to its cytotoxicity.","['Avramis, V I', 'Powell, W C', 'Mecum, R A']","['Avramis VI', 'Powell WC', 'Mecum RA']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles 90027.']",['eng'],['CA 38905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5V71D8JOKK (fazarabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00694333 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;25(1):19-24. doi: 10.1007/BF00694333.,,,,,,,,,

The total histamine levels in the peripheral blood of healthy donors (n = 10) ranged from 10 to 100 ng/ml, the plasma histamine values from 0.02 to 0.6 ng/ml blood. Increased levels of total histamine were measured in myeloproliferative syndromes, i.e. in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (8 of 9), myelofibrosis (OMS) (2 of 4), and polycythaemia vera (PCV) (1 of 2). An excessive increase in total histamine was observed in healthy rhesus monkeys (n = 10) treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). The total histamine value correlated with the absolute number of circulating blood basophils (correlation coefficient: 0.9). The calculated content of histamine per basophil was found to be 0.5 to 1.5 pg. Plasma histamine values in patients suffering from myeloproliferative syndromes were within the normal range. In contrast, a moderate to marked increase in plasma histamine values was observed in monkeys during IL-3 treatment.

However, 14 consecutive daily injections of rG-CSF prolonged the mean survival time of the mice implanted with the leukemic cells.

Complete tumor elimination required that the transferred T cells proliferate in the host and mediate an anti-tumor effect for more than 30 days. Non-cytolytic L3T4+ T helper (Th) cells were capable of eliminating disseminated tumor without the participation of Lyt-2+ cytotoxic T cells (Tc). Purified or cloned Lyt-2+ T cells were also effective in therapy, but required the concurrent administration of either L3T4+ Th or interleukin 2 (IL-2) for optimal efficacy. L3T4+ Th appear to function via secretion of lymphokines that activate macrophages to a cytotoxic state. Lyt-2+ Tc, in addition to direct cytotoxicity, may mediate tumor eradication in part by secretion of lymphokines that activate in vivo tumoricidal macrophages. These studies suggested that the reported efficacy of individual T cell subsets in therapy of particular tumors might not reflect resistance or susceptibility to a cytotoxic effector mechanism, but rather the efficiency with which a T cell subset is activated by the tumor and/or recognizes the tumor antigen. Methods were developed to independently assess the activation and proliferation requirements of each subset. L3T4+ Th required that macrophages degrade tumor antigens in lysosomes and present the antigens in the context of class II molecules, and produced IL-2 and IL-4 as endogenous growth factors. By contrast, Lyt-2+ T cells recognized the tumor directly, required macrophages only to produce IL-1 for activation, and produced IL-2 but not IL-4 as an endogenous growth factor. The ability of T cell subsets to recognize the distinct retroviral tumor antigens expressed on FBL leukemia was assessed using cell lines or recombinant vaccinia viruses transfected with selected retroviral genes. Highly selective antigen recognition was detected, with Lyt-2+ Tc cells recognizing products of gag but not envelope genes, and L3T4+ Th recognizing envelope but not gag products. The results suggest that even complex unique tumor antigens may elicit only limited host T cell responses.","['Greenberg, P', 'Klarnet, J', 'Kern, D', 'Okuno, K', 'Riddell, S', 'Cheever, M']","['Greenberg P', 'Klarnet J', 'Kern D', 'Okuno K', 'Riddell S', 'Cheever M']","['Division of Oncology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/therapy', 'Epitopes', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1988;19:287-301.,,,,,,,,,

Normal granulocytes showed G-CSF binding sites on their surface at higher densities (703 to 1,296 sites per cell). G-CSF receptors appeared to be of a single affinity type with a dissociation constant (kd) ranging between 214 and 378 pmol/L for AML blasts and 405 to 648 pmol/L for granulocytes. In 12 of 14 cases, including those with relatively low specific binding, G-CSF was a potent inducer of DNA synthesis of blasts in vitro; therefore, apparently relatively few receptors are required to permit activation of AML cell growth. However, in two cases cell cycling was not activated in response to G-CSF despite G-CSF receptor availability. The results show that G-CSF receptors of high affinity are frequently expressed on the blasts of human AML, but their presence may not be a strict indicator of the proliferative responsiveness of the cells to G-CSF.","['Budel, L M', 'Touw, I P', 'Delwel, R', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Budel LM', 'Touw IP', 'Delwel R', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64230-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Dec;74(8):2668-73.,,,,,,,,,

When nucleoside kinase was rate limiting to arabinosyl nucleotide accumulation, cells preloaded with F-ara-ATP showed increased rates of ara-CTP and ara-GTP accumulation, whereas cells preloaded with ara-CTP had decreased rates of F-ara-ATP and ara-GTP accumulation.

F-ara-ATP accumulation was inhibited in cells containing all other arabinosyl nucleotides, whereas ara-ATP metabolism was not affected by preincubation with any other nucleoside.

The differential effects of arabinosyl nucleotides and cellular metabolism of other arabinosyl nucleosides are due to phosphorylation by distinct nucleoside kinases that likely have characteristic sensitivities to cellular dNTP levels.","['Gandhi, V', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '3714-60-1 (ara-ATP)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', ""72490-81-4 (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.77 (nucleoside phosphotransferase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Arabinonucleosides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleotides/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/analysis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(89)90127-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90127-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Oct 15;38(20):3551-8. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90127-5.,,,,,,,,,

The primary target of these nucleosides appeared to be 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribofuranose-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase. MRPP-5'-monophosphate was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 40 microM) of the activation of this enzyme by the cofactor inorganic phosphate (K alpha = 2.2 mM). Consequently, ARPP and MRPP treatment of WI-L2 cultures rapidly inhibited both de novo pyrimidine and purine synthesis as well as the nucleotide salvage reactions dependent on PRPP, ARPP or MRPP treatment completely prevented [14C]bicarbonate incorporation into acid-soluble pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. The rate of salvage of [8-14C]hypoxanthine to form IMP was decreased by 85%. Treatment of cells with these agents caused a 50% reduction in the steady-state level of PRPP. When the capacity of the treated cells for sustained synthesis of PRPP was examined by adenine incorporation, the rate of adenine uptake was inhibited by greater than 50%. In vivo treatment of BDF1 mice with a single dose of ARPP (173 mg/kg) or MRPP (62 mg/kg) extended the mean life span of the mice, which had been inoculated intraperitoneally 1 day earlier with 1 x 10(6) L1210 murine leukemia cells, by 62 and 82% respectively.

In contrast, BALB/c-H-2b (BALB.B) mice, immunized with GV, produced antibodies which neutralized both GV and the variant virus, indicating that BALB.B mice respond to epitopes distinct from those recognized by BALB.K mice.

IgE is detected by intracytoplasmic fluorescence staining and by RIA. Clinical, hematological, and immunological parameters (including Rai stage, WBC, Lc, sIg kappa/lambda, CD5, and CD23 expression) cannot distinguish the IgE responder from the nonresponder patients. IL-4 alone is a potent inducer of human IgE synthesis by normal PBMC and we show here that its effect is strikingly enhanced by HC. The IgE produced by B-CLLs are monoclonal since they display the same L chain type as the freshly isolated CD5+ B-CLLs. We, therefore, conclude that the combination of IL-4 and HC can abrogate the maturation arrest of CD5+ B-CLLs by inducing their differentiation into IgE-producing cells. The present data provide a unique model to study the isotype switching to IgE and the regulation of human IgE synthesis by monoclonal human B cells.","['Sarfati, M', 'Luo, H', 'Delespesse, G']","['Sarfati M', 'Luo H', 'Delespesse G']","['Notre-Dame Hospital Research Centre, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.170.5.1775 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Nov 1;170(5):1775-80. doi: 10.1084/jem.170.5.1775.,,,,,,PMC2189500,,,

HRA-N caused dose-related histamine release from human basophils (5% to 22% net) and from isolated human cutaneous mast cells (3% to 28% net). Equivalent amounts of histamine were released from human basophils, RBL cells, and cultured mouse P cells exposed to HRA-N (16.3 +/- 3.4%, 12.2 +/- 1.2%, and 15.5 +/- 2.5%, respectively; p was not significant). Intradermal injections of HRA-N also caused chlorpheniramine-inhibitable blueing in vivo in rat and guinea pig skin. In general, supernatants that were active on RBL cells also induced histamine release from human basophils, although the magnitude of response to individual HRA-N preparation varied among basophil donors. HRA-N is stable to boiling and filters at a molecular weight greater than 1000 daltons. Boiling enhances HRA-N, suggesting the presence of a heat-labile inhibitor of HRA-N. These data suggest that HRA-N is a heat-stable factor that causes histamine release from human basophils and human cutaneous mast cells, that HRA-N is active across species lines both in vivo and in vitro, and that HRA-N acts maximally to induce histamine release under physiologic conditions.","['White, M V', 'Baer, H', 'Kubota, Y', 'Kaliner, M']","['White MV', 'Baer H', 'Kubota Y', 'Kaliner M']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Allergic Diseases Section, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['A107507-03/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['45PG892GO1 (Evans Blue)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/metabolism', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Evans Blue/administration & dosage', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Skin/drug effects', 'Temperature']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0091-6749(89)90308-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0091-6749(89)90308-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1989 Nov;84(5 Pt 1):773-80. doi: 10.1016/0091-6749(89)90308-4.,,,,,,,,,

Associated RNase H is essentially regarded as an endonuclease.,18808-17,"The intrinsic properties of reverse transcriptase in reverse transcription were studied using a synthetic, partial ovalbumin mRNA with a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide annealed to the 3'-end of the RNA as a model substrate. With or without concomitant cDNA synthesis, the RNase H activity of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV)-reverse transcriptase cleaved the substrate at a site which would leave a hybrid of between 7 and 14 base pairs between the 3' termini of the RNA and DNA oligonucleotide. Variability in the exact size of the hybrid probably reflects some weak base preference for cleavage by the enzyme. These short hybrids can be recognized as substrates by Escherichia coli RNase H and can be utilized by reverse transcriptase as sites for continuation of cDNA synthesis. Substrates with 5'-triphosphorylated termini, 3'-OH, 3'-phosphate, 3'-end hairpin structures and 20 base pair hybrids on the middle region of long RNA more than 300 bases or on circular RNA were all cleaved by AMV-reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H, indicating that the RNase H activity is essentially regarded as an endonuclease degrading RNA moiety in RNA-DNA hybrid. The modes of action of reverse transcriptase from murine leukemia virus and Rous-associated virus 2 were the same as that of AMV-reverse transcriptase, except that the size of the remaining hybrid and the specificity for cleavage depended on the reverse transcriptase. We propose a possible model to explain the mode of action of RNase H and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities in reverse transcription.","['Oyama, F', 'Kikuchi, R', 'Crouch, R J', 'Uchida, T']","['Oyama F', 'Kikuchi R', 'Crouch RJ', 'Uchida T']","['Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Avian Leukosis Virus/*enzymology', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Endoribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Ovalbumin/genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Circular', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",1989/11/05 00:00,1989/11/05 00:01,['1989/11/05 00:00'],"['1989/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)51539-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Nov 5;264(31):18808-17.,,,,,,,,,

Although apparently homogeneous, both cloned cell lines can also yield small numbers of three other cell types. The more-elongated cell type can be obtained directly by replating cells from the medium of the epithelial-like cell cultures or by picking and culturing single cells to form representative lines. Immunofluorescent and immunocytochemical analysis of these cell lines growing on plastic or as tumor-nodules in nude mice for epithelial membrane antigens, various cytokeratins, various actins, laminin, Type IV collagen, the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), and a 135-kDa glycoprotein confirm the epithelial nature of the epithelial-like cells and suggest a myoepithelial origin for the more-elongated cell type. Ultrastructural analysis largely confirms the results, although the myofilamental bundles can be scanty in the growing myoepithelial-like cells. The other two cell types are possibly related to the keratinizing and casein-secreting cells seen in the epithelial tumor-nodules before and after mating the mice, respectively. The myoepithelial-like cells produce 5- to 17-fold more laminin, Type IV collagen, CALLA, and the 135-kDa glycoprotein than the epithelial cells, and all of these antigens are preferentially found on myoepithelial cells in vivo.

IL-6 production was found to be specific for cells from patients with an AML with monocytic differentiation (12 of 15 M4 and M5 patients, 0 of 15 M1 and M2 patients). Moreover, IL-6 production was paralleled by IL-1 production. The IL-6- and IL-1-producing cells were mainly found in the more mature monocytic cell fractions, defined as CD14-positive and CD34-negative adherent cells. By limiting dilution experiments, it could be excluded that the production of IL-1 or IL-6 was due to contamination with normal monocytes.","['van der Schoot, C E', 'Jansen, P', 'Poorter, M', 'Wester, M R', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'Aarden, L A', 'van Oers, R H']","['van der Schoot CE', 'Jansen P', 'Poorter M', 'Wester MR', 'von dem Borne AE', 'Aarden LA', 'van Oers RH']","['Central Laboratory, The Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84990-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 1;74(6):2081-7.,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated whether alterations in the activity of this viral regulatory element also occur during differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. The Mo-MuLV LTR and the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter were introduced into HL-60 promyelocytes on Epstein-Barr virus-derived chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vectors. When these cells were induced to terminally differentiate, transcription from the Mo-MuLV LTR was induced approximately 10-fold. Expression from the SV40 promoter remained constant during differentiation of these cells. Replacing the SV40 transcriptional enhancer with the Mo-MuLV LTR transcriptional enhancer rendered the SV40 promoter inducible during differentiation.

Furthermore, we found previously that secondary plus-strand origins, identified in vitro, also show strong similarity to the PPT. Taken together, these data suggest that RNase H recognizes a specific sequence at the PPT as a signal to cleave the RNA at a precise location, producing a primer for the initiation of plus-DNA strands. We have analyzed the RNase H recognition sequence by producing a large number of single and double mutations within the PPT. Our findings suggest that no single residue in the +5 to -6 region (where the cleavage occurs between -1 and +1) is essential; mutations at these positions introduced heterogeneity at the cleavage site, but cleavage is still predominantly at the correct location. Furthermore, base-pairing is not required at the +1 position of the RNase H cleavage site, but a mismatched base-pair at the -1 position causes imprecision in the cleavage reaction. Interestingly, the A residue at position -7 seems to be critical in positioning the RNase H enzyme for correct cleavage. The preference of the enzyme for cleaving between G and A residues may play a minor role in determining the specificity.","['Rattray, A J', 'Champoux, J J']","['Rattray AJ', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],['2T32GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)']",IM,"['Base Composition', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Endoribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Purines/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H']",1989/08/05 00:00,1989/08/05 00:01,['1989/08/05 00:00'],"['1989/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-2836(89)90508-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-2836(89)90508-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1989 Aug 5;208(3):445-56. doi: 10.1016/0022-2836(89)90508-1.,,,,,,,,,

Fibroblast monolayers as well as factors in their supernatants also increased proliferation and histamine content of bone marrow cells. Concentrated supernatants (Mr greater than 10,000) also inhibited cell proliferation and induced histamine content. The same fraction concentrated on a Mr cut-off greater than 50,000 enhanced cell growth and the total histamine content per culture. Thus, fibroblast supernatants contained both growth promoting and inhibitory factors. However, using the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line as a test system for such fibroblast-derived differentiation factors, we showed that if cell proliferation was inhibited, histamine content was also enhanced. Furthermore, certain drugs known to inhibit cell division, such as sodium butyrate or hydroxyurea, were also found to cause an increase in histamine content of RBL cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that basophil/mast cell differentiation, in terms of augmentation of cellular histamine levels, may be achieved by exposure to certain growth-inducing cytokines, factors inhibiting proliferation or pharmacological agents which inhibit cell proliferation.","['Brantschen, S', 'de Weck, A L', 'Stadler, B M']","['Brantschen S', 'de Weck AL', 'Stadler BM']","['Institute of Clinical Immunology, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Histamine/*metabolism', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(89)80022-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(89)80022-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1989 Jun;179(2-3):271-82. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(89)80022-1.,,,,,,,,,

Two G1 phase populations of RA-treated FL cells were identified: one with an intermediate RNA content (T-cells) similar to G1 cells in near-plateau-phase control cultures and the other with a very low RNA content (Q-cells) similar to DMSO-differentiated cells; although quiescent, RA-treated cells remained undifferentiated as evidenced by the absence of late-stage markers of erythroid maturation. 3. Decreases in the cellular content of p35 occurred in both DMSO- and RA-treated FL cells, correlating with the onset of accumulation of cells into G1, and stabilized by 48 hr after initial exposure to either inducer. 4. Down-regulation in the cellular p35 content, thus, appears to be linked to entrance of FL cells into a quiescent substrate and independent of the subsequent capacity for erythroid differentiation.","['Higgins, P J', 'Lipkin, M', 'Bueti, C', 'Traganos, F']","['Higgins PJ', 'Lipkin M', 'Bueti C', 'Traganos F']","['Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology, VA Medical Center, Albany, NY 12208.']",['eng'],"['CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Biochem,The International journal of biochemistry,0250365,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0020-711x(89)90380-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Biochem. 1989;21(6):619-26. doi: 10.1016/0020-711x(89)90380-7.,,,,,,,,,

Synergistic cell killing of Chinese hamster ovary cells in these clonogenic survival assays was observed only when the cells had been exposed to trimetrexate (25 microM) for 2 to 4 h prior to 5-fluorouracil exposure (either 125 or 250 microM). The schedule dependence of the observed synergy in vitro was closely linked to trimetrexate-induced changes in cellular 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) pools. Exposure to 25 microM trimetrexate induced increases in PRPP pools to 398% and 761% of control values at 2 and 4 h, respectively. Methotrexate (20 microM) also increased Chinese hamster ovary cell PRPP content in a time-dependent fashion to values of 280 and 511% of control after 2 and 4 h of drug exposure. Previous in vivo studies demonstrated a modest degree of therapeutic synergy between trimetrexate and 5-fluorouracil against P388 leukemia. Our in vitro results suggested that the degree of synergy seen in vivo could be increased with appropriate schedule changes. Mice were implanted i.p. with 10(6) P388 leukemia cells on Day 0 and were treated with trimetrexate (every 3 h for eight injections; Days 1, 5, and 9) and 5-fluorouracil (Days 1, 5, and 9) as single agents or in combination on one of two schedules; 5-fluorouracil was administered with either the first or the last of the eight trimetrexate doses on Days 1, 5, and 9. Both treatment regimens demonstrated therapeutic synergy but, as predicted from the in vitro data, the ""5-fluorouracil last"" was superior to the ""5-fluorouracil first"" sequence. Treatment with the optimal doses on the ""5-fluorouracil last"" sequence (trimetrexate, 31; 5-fluorouracil, 33 mg/kg/injection) produced an increased life span of 183% and a net reduction in tumor cell burden of 6.7 logs compared with a 111% increased life span (net reduction in tumor burden of 2.6 logs) produced by the most active of the single agents, 5-fluorouracil. Thus the efficacy of the combination of trimetrexate with 5-fluorouracil was sequence and time dependent both in vitro and in vivo. The synergy, observed in vitro and probably in vivo, was linked to a trimetrexate-induced elevation of intracellular PRPP, thus facilitating the production of 5-fluoropyrimidine nucleotides. These data are similar to the sequence and schedule dependency of the methotrexate/5-fluorouracil combination with important differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Elliott, W L', 'Howard, C T', 'Dykes, D J', 'Leopold, W R']","['Elliott WL', 'Howard CT', 'Dykes DJ', 'Leopold WR']","['Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert and Co., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '7540-64-9 (Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/*administration & dosage', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*administration & dosage', 'Trimetrexate']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 15;49(20):5586-90.,,,,,,,,,

The administration of interleukin 2 (IL2) with or without ex vivo generated lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells represents a potential approach to eradicating residual disease after ABMT. However, since LAK precursor activity is radiosensitive, high dose chemoradiotherapy may abrogate LAK function and preclude clinical responsiveness to IL2 after ABMT. Furthermore, since lymphocyte subsets which mediate LAK activity may recover at different rates after ABMT, LAK cells may be phenotypically and/or functionally altered after ABMT. To determine whether IL2 responsive LAK precursor cells are present in the circulation after ABMT, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma were tested for IL2-inducible LAK activity 17-83 days after ABMT. Cells were cultured with IL2 (1000-2000 units/ml) for 4 or 5 days and then tested for cytolytic activity and/or cell phenotype. LAK activity against the Daudi cell line was detected in every PBMC sample from every patient at every time point tested. The Raji cell line and a fresh allogeneic ovarian carcinoma were also lysed by LAK cells generated after ABMT. In the subgroup of patients transplanted for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, LAK precursor activity appeared comparable to that of healthy controls. Culture with IL2 resulted in increased mean IL2 receptor expression in lymphocytes from patients after ABMT (3.1-9.9%) and from healthy controls (3.1-12.0%). After culture with IL2, the percentage of cells bearing the natural killer cell-associated Leu-19 determinant was significantly higher in patient PBMC than in normal control PBMC (28.3 versus 8.7%). Positive and negative cell selection by fluorescence sorting after culture with IL2 revealed that most of the LAK activity after ABMT was mediated by the Leu-19+ cells. Although CD5+ T-cells were devoid of LAK activity, a subset LAK effectors was CD8+. Thus, LAK activity is rapidly reconstituted after ABMT and is mediated by cells phenotypically similar to those in normal controls. These results support the feasibility of IL2 +/- LAK as consolidative immunotherapy after ABMT.","['Higuchi, C M', 'Thompson, J A', 'Cox, T', 'Lindgren, C G', 'Buckner, C D', 'Fefer, A']","['Higuchi CM', 'Thompson JA', 'Cox T', 'Lindgren CG', 'Buckner CD', 'Fefer A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/therapy', 'Time Factors']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 15;49(20):5509-13.,,,,,,,,,

Earlier studies showed markedly less in vivo accumulation of F-ara ATP the principal active metabolite, in gastrointestinal mucosa (GI) and bone marrow (BM) compared with P388 after F-araA or F-araAMP administration. To elucidate the mechanism of toxicity this work has examined the pharmacodynamics of F-araAMP anabolites, F-araATP and F-ATP, in P388 cells, BM and GI mucosa tissues after nontoxic (LD1) and toxic (LD50) doses of F-araAMP. F-araATP was the major triphosphate metabolite in acid-soluble extracts from P388 cells, BM, and GI mucosa tissues. F-araATP accumulated to approximately 1 mM in P388 cells after either LD1 or LD50 treatment of F-araAMP and was eliminated with a t1/2,el of approximately 5 h. The ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0----infinity) of F-araATP was 1.01 after the LD50 over the LD1 doses of F-araAMP. BM and GI mucosa tissues accumulated 40-fold less F-araATP than the concentration in P388 cells. 2-Fluoro-ATP, a second toxic anabolite, accumulated in P388 cells to 156 +/- 39 microM and 447 +/- 79 microM after the two doses of the drug, respectively. The ratio of area under the curve (AUC) of F-ATP in P388 cells after the two doses of F-araAMP was 38.77, which approaches the ratio of % lethality (LD50/LD1 = 50). F-ATP was also quantitated in BM and GI mucosa reaching one-fifth to one-half the concentration of F-araATP after the LD50 dose of F-araAMP. The AUC values of F-ATP (0----24 h) were 9.5- to 12.5-fold higher after the LD50 than after the LD1 dose of F-araAMP.

Preliminary studies of normal bone marrow cells indicated that CD11c expression was not restricted to cells of monocytic lineage but was also present, with apparent lower density, on significant proportions of mature and immature granulocytes. Examination of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes revealed that the non-monocytic leukaemias (n = 33) were CD11c-, defined as less than 30% positive cells, whereas all but one of the AMML-M4 (n = 13) and AMoL-M5 (n = 14) cases were CD11c+.

Membrane CD11c expression was also compared to the more widely used markers of monocytic differentiation; cytoplasmic alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and membrane CD14 expression. This analysis showed that all 13 AMML-M4 leukaemias studied, including seven cases that were CD14- and eight that were ANAE-, were CD11c+. In addition, the AMoL-M5 cases (all of which were ANAE+) could be phenotypically subdivided into CD11c+ CD14+ (n = 9), CD11c+ CD14- (n = 4) and CD11c- CD14- (n = 1) subgroups.

The c-fos gene product is associated in transcriptional complexes with the c-jun product. These protooncogenes are part of the regulatory network of gene expression. The present study was designed to investigate expression of the c-jun protooncogene in human circulating myelomonocytic cells. We found that c-jun is constitutively expressed in normal monocytes and granulocytes, whereas low levels of transcripts are found in lymphocytes. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples of French-American-British Cooperative Group (FAB) subtypes 1 through 4 express appreciable levels of this protooncogene. Normal phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated lymphocytes express high levels of c-jun. Expression in normal myelomonocytic cells is detectable even after 18 hours of culture. The c-jun transcripts in myelomonocytic cells have a half-life of approximately 20 minutes and are superinduced by cycloheximide, which affects both the degradation rate of mRNA and the transcriptional activity of the c-jun gene. Functional activation of monocytes and granulocytes with phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharide, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) increase c-jun expression. This induction is rapid, transient, and does not require intervening protein synthesis. Runoff experiments showed that in freshly isolated untreated monocytes, the c-jun gene is constitutively transcribed, and that induction by lipopolysaccharide is at least in part at the transcriptional level. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment reduced the degradation rate of c-jun transcripts, prolonging the half-life to approximately two hours. Expression of c-jun in resting and activated monocytes and granulocytes suggests that this protooncogene may play a role in the differentiation and activation of cells belonging to the myelomonocytic lineage.","['Bertani, A', 'Polentarutti, N', 'Sica, A', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Mantovani, A', 'Colotta, F']","['Bertani A', 'Polentarutti N', 'Sica A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Mantovani A', 'Colotta F']","['Instituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/blood/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75701-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1811-6.,,,,,,,,,

DTH to subcutaneously (s.c.) administered RMB-1 cells appeared on day 4, with a maximum DTH response on day 6 or 7. The induction of DTH could be prevented by intravenous (i.v.) pre-immunisation with R-MuLV-induced tumour cells several days before the s.c. immunisation. The three R-MuLV-induced tumour cell lines showed cross-reactivity in the DTH assay, whereas no cross-reactivity was found with syngeneic WEHI-3 cells. This indicates that the three R-MuLV-induced tumour cell lines share a virally encoded or induced antigenic determinant, which activates T-cells. When the RMB-1 cells used for immunisation had been cultured in medium supplemented with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the subsequent DTH response was increased. This coincided with an increased expression of the R-MuLV-specific antigenic determinants on RMB-1 cells as demonstrated by Scatchard analysis. Furthermore, IFN-gamma increased the MHC class I antigen expression on RMB-1 cells, whereas the class II antigen expression remained undetectable.","['Knulst, A C', 'Berends, D', 'Bazuin, C', 'van Rooij, H C', 'de Both, N J', 'Benner, R']","['Knulst AC', 'Berends D', 'Bazuin C', 'van Rooij HC', 'de Both NJ', 'Benner R']","['Department of Cell Biology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis', '*Hypersensitivity, Delayed', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', '*Rauscher Virus', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*immunology']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1989.284 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1989 Sep;60(3):351-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1989.284.,,,,,,PMC2247201,,,

Addition of IL-6 or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which act synergistically with IL-3 on dormant progenitors, partially neutralized the inhibition by TGF beta of colony formation from cells of 5-FU-treated mice. We then exposed day-2 post-5-FU marrow cells to these factors for 2 days in serum-free suspension culture, washed, and replated alliquots of cells for analysis of the surviving fractions of the progenitors. While TGF beta almost totally abolished the colony-forming ability of the dormant progenitors, IL-6 and G-CSF abrogated the inhibitory effects of TGF beta.

Quantitative assessment of the effect of fixation, dehydration and embedding on the preservation of antigenicity during tissue preparation for electron microscopy, using light microscopic peroxidase anti-peroxidase immunocytochemistry, enabled the selection of preparation conditions that adequately preserved both antigenicity and ultrastructure. OsO4 post-fixation, following primary aldehyde fixation, improved the retention of antigenicity during dehydration and embedding and the preservation of fine structure. Partial rather than complete dehydration retained more of the antigenicity. The efficiency, sensitivity and resolution of immunolabelling and the ultrastructure and quality of sections achieved after embedding in LR White were superior to those obtained after embedding in Lowicryl K4M.

Highly metastatic in vivo passaged FLC (either interferon-sensitive 745 or interferon alpha/beta-resistant 3Cl-8 cells) expressed higher levels of class I H-2K and H-2D antigens on their cell membrane with respect to the non-metastatic in vitro passaged counterparts. The increased expression of H-2 class I antigens was associated with an increased transcription of H-2K and H-2D genes. As both in vitro and in vivo passaged FLC have been shown to be resistant in vitro to the natural killer (NK) cell activity, we tried to correlate the levels of expression of histocompatibility antigens with the in vivo clearance of [125I]UDR-labeled FLC. However, no correlation was found between the levels of expression of H-2 antigens and the in vivo clearance of tumor cells. In fact, in vivo passaged FLC (tested either after 1 or after 15 in vitro passages) expressed virtually identical levels of H-2 antigens; however, the freshly explanted in vivo passaged FLC exhibited markedly lower levels of clearance from the lung, spleen and liver (when injected i.v. in DBA/2 mice) with respect to the corresponding FLC cultivated for several passages in vitro. Pretreatment of in vitro passaged 745 FLC with either interferon alpha/beta or interferon gamma resulted in the acquisition of some metastatic potential of FLC to the liver when interferon-treated FLC were subsequently injected i.v. in DBA/2 mice; such in vitro treatments resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in the expression of H-2K antigens versus the control untreated FLC.

On the other hand, hydroxyurea and cytosine-arabinoside treatment causes DNA hypermethylation, which, in the case of the cytidine analogue is of only transient nature. These results show that the differentiation of human melanoma cells can be accompanied by variable changes of DNA methylation levels. In another set of experiments, the DNA methylation levels have been analyzed during cytosine-arabinoside-induced differentiation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells. In this system, a transient DNA demethylation precedes the establishment of the differentiated phenotype. Since DNA replication is inhibited, this demethylation cannot be explained by inhibition of the maintenance activity of DNA methyltransferase, but is more likely caused by an active excision of 5-methylcytosine from DNA.","['Pfeifer, G P', 'Steigerwald, S D', 'Grunwald, S']","['Pfeifer GP', 'Steigerwald SD', 'Grunwald S']","['Zentrum der Biologischen Chemie, Universitat Frankfurt, FRG.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Biophys,Cell biophysics,8002185,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin', 'Autoradiography', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Melanoma', 'Methylation', 'Phenotype', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02991581 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biophys. 1989 Aug-Oct;15(1-2):79-86. doi: 10.1007/BF02991581.,,,,,,,,,

Report of a cancer-prone family.,1474-9,"A cancer-prone family was studied to determine if certain chromosomal abnormalities might have predisposed members to develop diverse types of malignancies. The types of neoplasia that occurred in this family included cancers of the breast and stomach, multiple myeloma, dermatofibrosarcoma, Wilm's tumor, and leukemia; the latter three occurred in children at an early age. Peripheral lymphocytes from 13 family members were examined for the presence of constitutional chromosomal abnormalities, fragile sites, and mutagen sensitivity. Our data shows that all living members of this family who had cancers were hypersensitive to chromosome breakage induced by bleomycin. In contrast, neither constitutional chromosomal abnormality nor heritable type of folate-sensitive fragile site was observed in any member. The above findings suggest that genetic defects affecting chromosomal breakage and repair may be contributing factors for cancer development in several members of this family.","['Liang, J C', 'Pinkel, D P', 'Bailey, N M', 'Trujillo, J M']","['Liang JC', 'Pinkel DP', 'Bailey NM', 'Trujillo JM']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['CA43585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Mutagens)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bleomycin/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Chromosomes/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Pedigree']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19891001)64:7<1474::aid-cncr2820640719>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Oct 1;64(7):1474-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19891001)64:7<1474::aid-cncr2820640719>3.0.co;2-s.,,,,,,,,,

The major objective of the study was to compare survival outcome of both regimens. Thirty-one patients on arm A received one or two courses of daunorubicin, vincristine, and cytarabine for remission induction followed by one additional cycle for consolidation in case of complete remission (CR). Among 29 patients on arm B, cytoreductive chemotherapy (hydroxyurea, cytarabine) had to be initiated for palliation of leukemia-associated complications in 21 patients at a median of 9 days after diagnosis. Overall survival duration for patients treated on arm A was significantly (P = .015) longer than the survival in arm B (median survival, 21 weeks v 11 weeks; projected survival at 2.5 years, 13% v 0%). Eighteen (58%) of arm A patients and none (0%) of arm B patients entered CR. Of the first group, projected disease-free survival at 2 years is 17%. The median percentages of days spent in the hospital by arm A and B patients were 55% and 50%, respectively.

Nanomolar concentrations of charbdotoxin (CTX), a purified peptide component of Leiurus quinquestriatus venom known to block Ca2+-activated K+ channels from muscle, blocked ""type n"" voltage-gated K+ channels in human T lymphoid cells. The Na+ channels occasionally expressed in these cells were unaffected by the toxin. From the time course of development and removal of K+ channel block we determined the rates of CTX binding and unbinding. CTX blocks K+ channels in Jurkat cells with a Kd value between 0.5 and 1.5 nM. Of the three types of voltage-gated K+ channels present in murine thymocytes, types n and n' are blocked by CTX at nanomolar concentrations. The third variety of K+ channels, ""type l,"" is unaffected by CTX. Noxiustoxin (NTX), a purified toxin from Centruroides noxius known to block Ca2+-activated K+ channels, also blocked type n K+ channels with a high degree of potency (Kd = 0.2 nM). In addition, several types of crude scorpion venoms from the genera Androctonus, Buthus, Centruroides, and Pandinus blocked type n channels. We conclude that CTX and NTX are not specific for Ca2+ activated K+ channels and that purified scorpion toxins will provide useful probes of voltage-gated K+ channels in T lymphocytes. The existence of high-affinity sites for scorpion toxin binding may help to classify structurally related K+ channels and provide a useful tool for their biochemical purification.","['Sands, S B', 'Lewis, R S', 'Cahalan, M D']","['Sands SB', 'Lewis RS', 'Cahalan MD']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['GM-14514/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-08021/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,2985110R,"['0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Scorpion Venoms)', '115422-61-2 (Charybdotoxin)', '85205-49-8 (noxiustoxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Charybdotoxin', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Potassium Channels/*drug effects', 'Scorpion Venoms/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1085/jgp.93.6.1061 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Physiol. 1989 Jun;93(6):1061-74. doi: 10.1085/jgp.93.6.1061.,,,,,,PMC2216250,,,

Palliatively treated cancers in organs of the peritoneal cavity had a significantly higher incidence than all other cancers combined. Cancer of the peritoneal cavity may impede venous drainage from the lower limbs and thus be an important factor in the onset of deep calf vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The anti-idiotype MoAb were characterized by immunofluorescence-binding studies, allotype reactivity, and immunoprecipitation studies and were found to recognize at least two distinct epitopes on the sIg of the neoplastic B cells. Differential effects of the soluble anti-idiotype MoAb on phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation were found; three types of anti-idiotype MoAb could be distinguished: (1) MoAb that enhanced the PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation, (2) MoAb without effect, and (3) MoAb that inhibited the PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation. Addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 could abolish the differential effects of the anti-idiotype MoAb on PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation. The negative effect of the type 3 MoAb on PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation was associated with a more than 10-fold stronger binding to sIg expressed on the B-PLL cells, compared with the other anti-idiotype MoAb. The differential effects of the types 1 and 2 MoAb cannot be explained solely by differences in the Fc portion of the MoAb and binding characteristics. Neither did differences in epitope specificity necessarily lead to differential effects on PMA-induced B-PLL-cell proliferation. In contrast to the clear differences found in the proliferation induction experiments, all MoAb were equally able to induce an early rise in free intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Our data suggest that for B-cell proliferation to occur, apart from early rises of intracellular Ca2+, more prolonged [Ca2+]i elevations or additional intracellular activation signals are required. The differences in proliferative responses of B-PLL cells to anti-idiotype MoAb may be relevant for immunotherapy of B-cell tumours with anti-idiotype MoAb.","['de Rie, M A', 'van Lier, R A', 'Imholz, M J', 'Schumacher, T N', 'van Schijndel, G M', 'Miedema, F']","['de Rie MA', 'van Lier RA', 'Imholz MJ', 'Schumacher TN', 'van Schijndel GM', 'Miedema F']","['Central Laboratory, the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb01208.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1989 Aug;30(2):249-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb01208.x.,,,,,,,,,

Earlier work had demonstrated that bone marrow cells characterized by low levels of Thy-1 and lack of a panel of lineage markers (Thy-1lo Lin- cells) were highly enriched for pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. In this paper, we present evidence that another bone marrow population, which expressed low levels of Thy-1 and coexpressed B220, a B-lineage-specific form of the leukocyte common antigen, contained early and potent precursors for B lymphocytes upon in vivo transfer to irradiated hosts. These Thy-1lo B220+ cells, comprising 1 to 2% of bone marrow cells, were enriched for large cells in the mitotic cycle; the population lacked significant pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell activity and myeloid-erythroid progenitors. Most strikingly, Thy-1lo B220+ cells represented a highly enriched population of bone marrow cells that could be targets of Abelson murine leukemia virus transformation. We propose that Thy-1lo B220+ bone marrow cells represent the earliest stage of committed lymphocyte progenitors, intermediate in differentiation between Thy-1lo Lin- pluripotent stem cells and, in the B lineage, Thy-1- B220+ pre-B cells.","['Tidmarsh, G F', 'Heimfeld, S', 'Whitlock, C A', 'Weissman, I L', 'Muller-Sieburg, C E']","['Tidmarsh GF', 'Heimfeld S', 'Whitlock CA', 'Weissman IL', 'Muller-Sieburg CE']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['AI-09072/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-19162/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/microbiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/microbiology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenotype', 'Thy-1 Antigens']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.6.2665-2671.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Jun;9(6):2665-71. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.6.2665-2671.1989.,,,,,,PMC362339,,"['Tidmarsh GF, Heimfeld S, Whitlock CA, Weissman IL, Muller-Sieburg CE.

These CSFs are normally produced exogenously by accessory cells. However, human acute myeloid leukemia cells have been found, in certain instances, to have constitutive, endogenous production of one or more of these CSFs. In order to address the molecular basis of this apparently anomalous production of CSFs, we studied granulocyte-, monocyte-, and granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor gene expression, gene structure, transcription rate, message stability, and message inducibility in human acute myeloid leukemia samples. CSF gene expression by Northern analysis was variable from no transcripts detectable to transcripts present for all three CSFs. No CSF gene structure abnormalities were detected by Southern blot analysis. Nuclear run-on assays found ongoing and relatively uniform CSF gene transcription irrespective of the levels of CSF expression detected by Northern analysis. However, the stability of the CSF transcripts appeared to correlate with the level detected on Northern blots. Despite the apparent similarity in the regulation of these CSFs to that seen in mature monocytes, the inducibility of the expression of these CSFs was found to differ significantly from that seen in these mature myeloid cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of CSF genes in human myeloid leukemias is primarily mediated through posttranscriptional mechanisms. These mechanisms are separate for each of the CSFs and apparently different from that found in normal blood monocytes.","['Ernst, T J', 'Ritchie, A R', ""O'Rourke, R"", 'Griffin, J D']","['Ernst TJ', 'Ritchie AR', ""O'Rourke R"", 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Sep;3(9):620-5.,,,,,,,,,

Using an immunoblotting technique with antiphosphotyrosine (anti-P-Tyr) antibodies, we examined whether P210bcr/abl protein was expressed in chronic phase cells in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We could detect P210bcr/abl protein in blast cells regardless of myeloid or lymphoid lineage but not in chronic phase cells from patients. However, in a patient with both blast cells and chronic phase cells, we could identify the protein only after the enrichment of the blast crisis cells by Percoll gradient centrifugation. When K562 cells were mixed with mature granuloid cells, the P210bcr/abl in K562 cells detected by immunoblotting was decreased. Using phosphotyrosyl proteins in K562 cells as substrates, high phosphotyrosyl (P-Tyr) phosphatase activity was observed, not only in the lysate of chronic phase cells from CML patients but also in the lysate of neutrophils from normal subjects. These findings suggest the possibility that high P-Tyr phosphatase activity prevents the detection of P210bcr/abl in CML cells in the chronic phase. The activity may be characteristic of mature cells and may regulate cellular events through dephosphorylation of P210bcr/abl.","['Shibata, K', 'Nishimura, J', 'Takahira, H', 'Nawata, H']","['Shibata K', 'Nishimura J', 'Takahira H', 'Nawata H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/enzymology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Sep;3(9):615-9.,,,,,,,,,

FK-506 shares a number of immunosuppressive properties with the cyclic peptide, cyclosporin A (CsA), although 10 to 100 times more potent in this regard. These similarities suggest that both agents may share a similar mechanism(s) of action at the biochemical level. We have identified a cytoplasmic binding protein for FK-506 in the human T cell line, JURKAT, using [3H]FK-506. The FK-506 binding protein has a mr of 10 to 12 kDa (as determined by gel filtration), is heat stable and does not bind CsA. This contrasts with the CsA binding protein, cyclophilin, in that cyclophilin is heat labile and has a mr of 15 to 17 kDa. Our data suggest that FK-506 binds to a low m.w. protein(s) in JURKAT cells, which is distinct from cyclophilin. This protein may mediate the immunosuppressive effects of FK-506 in T cells.

Problems have been encountered with the concentration and purification of intact virions of BLV and other retroviruses.

Therefore, other methods are sought to obtain a high yield of the external glycoproteins. The use of two-phase systems based on water soluble polymers is described for the extraction of BLV-gp51 from culture medium. Several polymer systems were tested and the results showed that some were attractive for large scale application. The classical combination dextran-polyethylene glycol gave promising results; a partition coefficient of about 0.02 was obtained for the distribution of the gp51 between the top and combined inter- and bottom phases. In a single extraction step it was possible to obtain 45% of the glycoprotein in a small volume bottom phase and at the same time about 15-fold purified. That should be compared with a recovery of less than 20% with the conventional centrifugation procedures.

The time course of [3H]PEP-Cu(II) uptake into AH66, AH66F, Ehrlich and P388 cells was biphasic. The first phase of uptake was completed within 5 minutes. The second, slower phase, of uptake into AH66, AH66F and Ehrlich cells increased linearly with incubation time, but that into P388 cells reached a plateau level. In L1210 cells, only the first rapid uptake was observed. The lower uptake into P388 and L1210 cells during the second phase may be related to their insensitivity to PEP. However, the uptake into AH66F cells was higher than that into AH66 cells, although AH66F cells were less sensitive to PEP than AH66 cells. Deamide PEP was detected in intact cells which had taken up [3H]PEP-Cu(II) during 4 hours. This confirmed that PEP-Cu(II) was transported into the cell, the copper removed and PEP metabolized to deamide PEP. [3H]PEP-Cu(II) uptake into AH66 and AH66F cells increased in proportion to the extracellular concentration of drug up to at least 200 micrograms/ml, suggesting that uptake was not mediated by a carrier system. Metabolic inhibitors such as NaN3 and 2,4-dinitrophenol enhanced [3H]PEP-Cu(II) uptake, but did not influence efflux. Uptake was also enhanced by membrane modifiers such as dibucaine and chlorpromazine which increase the fluidity of lipid membranes. The results suggest that PEP-Cu(II) was taken up into tumor cells by passive diffusion, controlled by an energy-dependent cell membrane barrier.","['Kuramochi, H', 'Takahashi, K', 'Takeuchi, T']","['Kuramochi H', 'Takahashi K', 'Takeuchi T']","['Research Laboratories, Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '56H9L80NIZ (Peplomycin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'L6JW2TJG99 (Dibucaine)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Bleomycin/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', 'Chlorpromazine/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colchicine/metabolism', 'Dibucaine/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia P388', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Peplomycin', 'Permeability', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Vinblastine/metabolism']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7164/antibiotics.42.1163 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1989 Jul;42(7):1163-70. doi: 10.7164/antibiotics.42.1163.,,,,,,,,,

Correlations exist between the cellular concentrations of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) in leukemic blast cells and inhibition of DNA synthetic capacity with the clinical response to high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HDara-C). 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza-C) and its congeners are potent DNA hypomethylating agents, an action closely associated with the reexpression of certain genes such as that for deoxycytidine kinase (dCk) in ara-C-resistant mouse and human leukemic cells. Reexpression of dCk could increase the cellular ara-CTP concentrations and the sensitivity to ara-C. A total of 17 pediatric patients with refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) received a continuous infusion of 5-Aza-C at 150 mg/m2 daily for 5 days after not responding to (13/17) or relapsing from (4/17) an HDara-C regimen (3 g/m2 over 3 h, every 12 h, x 8 doses). Approximately 3 days after the end of the 5-Aza-C infusion, the HDara-C regimen was given again with the idea that the induced DNA hypomethylation in the leukemic cells may have increased the dCk activity and that a reversal of the tumor drug resistance to ara-C could have occurred. Deoxycytidine kinase (expressed as cellular ara-CTP concentrations) in untreated blasts, DNA synthetic capacity (DSC), and the percentage of DNA methylcytidine levels were determined before and after 5-Aza-C administration. Cellular ara-CTP was enhanced to varying degrees in 15 of 16 patients after 5-Aza-C treatment. The average cellular concentration of ara-CTP determined in vitro by the sensitivity test was 314 +/- 390 microM, 2.3-fold higher than the average value before 5-Aza-C treatment. In 12 patients in whom the DNA methylation studies were completed before and after 5-Aza-C treatment, the average DNA hypomethylation level was 55.6% + 15.8% of pretreatment values (n = 13; mean +/- SD). DSC showed a profound decline in 2/9 evaluable patients who achieved a complete response (CR) after this regimen. The data suggest that treatment with a cytostatic but DNA-modulatory regimen of 5-Aza-C causes DNA hypomethylation in vivo, which is associated with dCk reexpression in the patients' leukemic blasts. The partial reversal of drug resistance to ara-C by 5-Aza-C yielded two CRs in this poor-prognosis, multiply relapsed patient population with refractory ALL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Avramis, V I', 'Mecum, R A', 'Nyce, J', 'Steele, D A', 'Holcenberg, J S']","['Avramis VI', 'Mecum RA', 'Nyce J', 'Steele DA', 'Holcenberg JS']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles 90027.']",['eng'],['CA 38905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00257619 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;24(4):203-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00257619.,,,,,,,,,

Culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under these conditions resulted in growth of a uniform population of cells with morphologic characteristics of large granular lymphocytes. The NKH1+/CD3- phenotype associated with IL-2-stimulated natural killer (NK) cells was present on 79% +/- 9% of cells. Absence of colony formation in conditions promoting the growth of CFU-GEMM indicated that the CML ALAK population was not contaminated with viable hematopoietic progenitors. Cytogenetic analysis of the CML ALAK population revealed 119/120 Ph1 negative metaphases and l/120 Ph1 positive metaphase in six patients. Southern blot analysis of CML ALAK failed to demonstrate a bcr gene rearrangement in seven patients known to have a bcr gene rearrangement in myeloid cells. Comparison of ALAK populations derived from peripheral blood of CML patients and normals revealed similar cytotoxicity against the NK-sensitive K562 cell line (104 +/- 36 LU v 88 +/- 19 LU; P = NS) and the NK-resistant Raji cell line (93 +/- 26 LU v 98 +/- 28 LU; P = NS). The proliferative capacity of CML ALAK cells (101 +/- 33 fold expansion) exceeds the growth potential of the normal ALAK cells (22.3 +/- 3 fold expansion; P = .02). Direct comparison of equal numbers of CML ALAK cells and a CML LAK cell population produced by incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in rIL-2 for 14 days without adherence revealed that the CML LAK population had significantly lower lytic activity against K562 and Raji cell lines. We are able to expand CML peripheral blood mononuclear cells to provide a population of ALAK cells with potent cytotoxic activity. The CML ALAK population is relatively homogeneous, not contaminated with viable stem cells, not derived from a malignant lineage, and more cytotoxic than equal numbers of CML LAK cells. Further studies are underway to determine if this ALAK population may be effective in autologous killing of chronic myelogenous leukemia stem cells.","['Verfaillie, C', 'Miller, W', 'Kay, N', 'McGlave, P']","['Verfaillie C', 'Miller W', 'Kay N', 'McGlave P']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Azure Stains)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Azure Stains', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-2', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/genetics/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phenotype', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85373-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):793-7.,,,,,,,,,

Receptors for GM-CSF and G-CSF were restricted to a subset of myelomonocytic cell lines whereas IL-3 receptors were also found on pre-B- or early B-cell lines. Receptors for all three CSFs were broadly distributed on ANL cells, with considerable variability in levels of expression. Measurement of the colony-forming ability of ANL cells in response to the CSFs showed that there was no direct correlation between the ability of the cells to respond to a growth factor and the absolute number of receptors expressed for that growth factor. Binding of radiolabeled IL-3 and GM-CSF to ANL cells produced complex biphasic curves. Further analysis showed that both IL-3 and GM-CSF were able to partially compete for specific binding of the heterologous radiolabeled ligand to cells from several ANL patients, suggesting that heterogeneity may exist in human CSF receptors.

Colony formation of leukemic blast progenitors was observed in 14 of 14 patients tested when purified blast cell fraction depleted of both T cells and monocytes was plated in methylcellulose without any colony-stimulating factor (CSF). However, there existed a minimal cell density required to initiate blast progenitor growth with marked patient-to-patient variation. To clarify the role of cell density on the spontaneous growth of blast progenitors, we tested whether leukemic cells produced and secreted some stimulatory humoral factor(s). Production of colony-stimulating activity (CSA) by blast cells was observed in 17 of 18 patients tested. Following further depletion of monocytes, the CSA levels decreased markedly in 14 patients, indicating that blast cells with monocytoid differentiation were responsible for CSA production. We also confirmed granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production by leukemic blasts using specific immunologic assays. When leukemic cells were divided into nonadherent nonphagocytic cell fraction and adherent cell fraction, only nonadherent nonphagocytic cells showed clonogenecity and adherent blast cells lacked the colony-forming capacity. The results indicate that there are at least two blast cell subpopulations in AML: one is proliferating subpopulation with self-renewal capacity and the other is supporting subpopulation with functions such as CSF production. The quite intimate relationship between these two blast cell subpopulations in AML may play an important role on the growth of leukemic blast progenitors in vitro.","['Murohashi, I', 'Tohda, S', 'Suzuki, T', 'Nagata, K', 'Yamashita, Y', 'Nara, N']","['Murohashi I', 'Tohda S', 'Suzuki T', 'Nagata K', 'Yamashita Y', 'Nara N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/analysis', 'Culture Media', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/analysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77318-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):35-41.,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies, however, have shown that for monitoring minimal residual disease in the circulation, assay for TdT alone is not sufficiently specific to distinguish leukemia cells from the background of rare normal blood TdT+ cells. In an attempt to increase specificity for leukemic cells, we have used double and triple immunophenotypic analysis to characterize normal circulating and bone marrow TdT+ cells. Overall, normal TdT+ cells were about 1000-fold more frequent in the marrow than in the blood. More than 75% of TdT+ cells in both the blood and marrow expressed the CD34, CD22, and HLA-DR antigens. However, circulating TdT+ cells infrequently expressed CD19 (4.5%) and CD9 (2.3%), compared with their marrow counterparts (74% and 47%, respectively). The brightly staining CD10+ phenotype, frequently associated with ALL blasts, was significantly less common among normal blood (5.7%) than marrow (31%) TdT+ cells. Although T-lineage markers were rarely expressed on TdT+ cells in either site, CD7+ cells were far more prevalent within the circulating TdT+ subset (4%) than among the marrow population (less than 0.2%). The results suggest a selective release of lineage-uncommitted and/or thymus-destined TdT+ cells from the marrow into the circulation. Moreover, since CD19, CD9, and high-density CD10 are frequently found on ALL blasts, staining for these markers on TdT+ cells in the circulation should improve the specificity of assay for residual common ALL cells. Likewise, assay for CD5+ and possibly CD7+ TdT+ cells in either marrow or blood should provide a very sensitive method of detection of T-ALL blasts.","['Smith, R G', 'Kitchens, R L']","['Smith RG', 'Kitchens RL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],['CA42891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*enzymology/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry/methods', 'Humans', '*Lectins', 'Neprilysin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*enzymology/immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77357-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):312-9.,,['Blood. 1990 May 1;75(9):1898-9.

Molecular cloning of a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin with ribonuclease activity.,163-76,"We have isolated a 725-bp full-length cDNA clone for the human eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). ECP is a small, basic protein found in the matrix of the eosinophil's large specific granule that has cytotoxic, helminthotoxic, and ribonuclease activity, and is a member of the ribonuclease multigene family. The cDNA sequence shows 89% sequence identity with that reported for the related granule protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). The open reading frame encodes a previously unidentified 27-amino acid leader sequence preceding a 133-residue mature ECP polypeptide with a molecular mass of 15.6 kD. The encoded amino acid sequence of ECP shows 66% identity to that of EDN and 31% identity to that of human pancreatic ribonuclease, including conservation of the essential structural cysteine and cataytic lysine and histidine residues. mRNA for ECP was detected in eosinophil-enriched peripheral granulocytes and in a subclone of the promyelocytic leukemia line, HL-60, induced toward eosinophilic differentiation with IL-5. No ECP mRNA was detected in uninduced HL-60 cells, or in HL-60 cells induced toward monocytic differentiation with vitamin D3 or toward neutrophilic differentiation with DMSO. In contrast, mRNA for EDN was detected in uninduced HL-60 cells and was upregulated in HL-60 cells induced with DMSO. Despite similarities in sequence and cellular localization, these results suggest that ECP and EDN are subject to different regulatory mechanisms.","['Rosenberg, H F', 'Ackerman, S J', 'Tenen, D G']","['Rosenberg HF', 'Ackerman SJ', 'Tenen DG']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['AI-22660/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-25230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Anthelmintics)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Eosinophil Granule Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Anthelmintics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Cytotoxins', 'Eosinophil Granule Proteins', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA/blood/genetics', 'Ribonucleases/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.170.1.163 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Jul 1;170(1):163-76. doi: 10.1084/jem.170.1.163.,,,,,['GENBANK/X15161'],PMC2189377,,,

The novel Ag was also recognized in vitro by anti-H-2Dd-specific CTL. In addition, DNA from all the thymomas, but not the DNA from normal adult AKR thymic cells showed a transcribed gene detectable with an H-2Dd-specific oligonucleotide probe. The molecular profile of the novel antigen was further studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by a computer based image analyzer system and reverse-phase HPLC tryptic peptide mapping. Its molecular pattern was different from the syngeneic H-2Kk, H-2Dk, and the allogeneic H-2Dd gene products. The two-dimensional gel pattern of the novel H-2 class I molecule had a different overall structure reflected in isoelectric point, number, and distribution of polypeptide spots. The tryptic peptide map analysis showed six peaks exclusively identified with the novel Ag. The calculated degree of homology with the corresponding H-2Dd, H-Dk, and H-Kk peptides was 41, 56, and 51%, respectively. In addition, an unusual cell surface distribution of the novel Ag was observed in most of the leukemic lines. The removal of sialic acid residues by neuraminidase treatment facilitated the detection of the allodeterminants by anti-H-2Dd-specific mAb and CTL. Furthermore, we showed that in one AKR tumor line, 424, there is a close association of the novel Ag with the syngeneic class I molecules.

Nodular sclerosis amounted to 52%, and systemic symptoms were present in 70% of patients. The median follow-up was 50 months from the initiation of therapy (range: 36-78 months). The complete remission rate was 80%, with no differences according to the main patient characteristics before therapy, except for bulky (65%) versus non bulky (88%) disease (p = 0.05). The actuarial 4-year overall (OS) and relapse-free survival were 78% and 71%, respectively. No clear-cut pretreatment characteristics showed an influence on survival, although there was a trend favoring non bulky versus bulky disease (p = 0.08). The actuarial 4-year OS of complete responders was 92%; all 13 patients who died had evidence of HD; the cause of death was disease progression and organ failure in 11 cases, acute myelomonocytic and opportunistic infections with AIDS in the other two cases, respectively. No severe pancytopenia episodes or life-threatening complications occurred during therapy; gastrointestinal and neurological toxicity were mild and no patient refused to complete the treatment. Menstruating women were given estrogen-progesterone combinations, and all continued to have regular menses throughout chemotherapy and afterwards; a young woman had a normal pregnancy resulting in a normal live birth. Only one case of stable amenorrhea was observed. Oligospermia after chemotherapy was seen in seven of 10 tested males, and azoospermia in one case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Brusamolino, E', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Morra, E', 'Inverardi, D', 'Merante, S', 'Castelli, G', 'Canevari, A', 'Dornini, G', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Brusamolino E', 'Lazzarino M', 'Morra E', 'Inverardi D', 'Merante S', 'Castelli G', 'Canevari A', 'Dornini G', 'Bernasconi C']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypogonadism/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Vinblastine', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1989 Mar-Apr;74(2):173-9.,,,,,,,,,

Galivan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 2598-2602, 1985) the synthesis and characterization of DL-erythro,threo-gamma-fluoromethotrexate (FMTX). The individual diastereomers, DL-erythro-FMTX (eFMTX) and DL-threo-FMTX (tFMTX), and their radiolabeled counterparts have now been prepared and characterized. Transport of eFMTX (Km = 9.3 microM; Vmax = 7.5 pmol/min/10(7) cells) was similar to that of methotrexate (MTX: Km = 6.6-9.9 microM; Vmax = 11.4-14.2 pmol/min/10(7) cells), while tFMTX (Km = 65.1 microM; Vmax = 8.4 pmol/min/10(7) cells) was transported less efficiently. Both isomers were able to saturate intracellular dihydrofolate reductase and accumulate further as unbound intracellular drug. Based on competition experiments and studies with MTX transport-defective cell lines, both isomers utilized the reduced folate/MTX transport system. Efflux half-times for the isomers were similar to those of MTX. Each isomer was equivalent to MTX in its ability to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase activity and bind to intracellular dihydrofolate reductase when the intracellular drug concentration was limiting. Both isomers had drastically diminished capacity to be metabolized to poly(gamma-glutamyl) metabolites by isolated folylpolyglutamate synthetase and in whole cells; tFMTX was metabolized to a slightly lesser extent than eFMTX. Using the CCRF-CEM human leukemia and H35 rat hepatoma cell lines, the growth-inhibitory effects of eFMTX were almost the same as those of MTX during continuous exposure, while tFMTX was slightly less potent. This difference in growth-inhibitory potency of the two isomers correlated with their ability to inhibit de novo thymidylate synthesis in the H35 cell line. These results indicate that both diastereomers of FMTX are similar in their properties to MTX, except that both are incapable of being readily converted to polyglutamate derivatives. As a result of these properties, both isomers could be used under appropriate conditions in comparative studies with MTX to define the roles of MTX polyglutamates.","['McGuire, J J', 'Graber, M', 'Licato, N', 'Vincenz, C', 'Coward, J K', 'Nimec, Z', 'Galivan, J']","['McGuire JJ', 'Graber M', 'Licato N', 'Vincenz C', 'Coward JK', 'Nimec Z', 'Galivan J']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (fluoresceinated methotrexate)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 15;49(16):4517-25.,,,,,,,,,

A preclinical evaluation of various new analogues using this new model was performed. The antitumor activities of KT6149, MX-2 (KRN8602), SM5887, menogaril (TUT-7), and liblomycin (NK313) were evaluated against four non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, PC-7, -9, -13, and -14; two small cell lung cancer cell lines, H69 and N231; four CDDP-resistant cell lines, PC-7/1.0, PC-9/0.5, PC-14/1.5, and H69/0.4; a human myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562; and its ADM-resistant subline, K562/ADM by clonogenic assay. The relative antitumor activities of these new analogues were compared with those of parental agents, mitomycin C, ADM, bleomycin, and several anticancer drugs, CDDP, daunomycin, vindesine, and etoposide. KT6149 was more active than mitomycin C against all lung cancer cell lines and the human myelogenous leukemia cell line. Menogaril showed greater activity than ADM, and MX-2 showed activity similar to ADM. However, the antitumor activity of SM5887 was lower than that of ADM. SM5887 and menogaril showed cross-resistance to K562/ADM. Nevertheless, the antitumor activity against K562/ADM of MX-2 was similar to that of the parental cell lines. The activity of liblomycin was similar to that of bleomycin. Thus, KT6149 appears to be the best analogue for use in a clinical trial against lung cancer. MX-2 was active even against ADM-resistant cancer cells. The values of relative resistance to CDDP or ADM were 4.7, 8.1, 7.5, 20.0, and 13.6 for PC-7/1.0, PC-9/0.5, PC-14/1.5, H69/0.4, and K562/ADM, respectively. CDDP-resistant cell lines showed no cross-resistance with other drugs in this study. K562/ADM showed cross-resistance against daunomycin, etoposide, and vindesine. In contrast, mitomycin C and bleomycin had nearly equal activity against K562 and K562/ADM. However, K562/ADM was 2.4-fold more sensitive to CDDP than its parental cell line, K562 (P less than 0.001).

This effect is also observed with dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which indicates phosphorylation of the 22kDa protein by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. This phosphorylation produces an electrophoretic mobility change of the 22kDa protein to a 24kDa region on gels. The change of mobility of the 22kDa protein induced by iloprost in HEL cells is also observed when the protein is labeled with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated with antiserum M90.

In contrast, cytosol of dbcAMP-differentiated cells reconstituted O2- formation only in the presence of GTP[gamma S], and cytosol of undifferentiated cells was inactive. Submaximally stimulatory amounts of cytosolic protein of Me2SO- and dbcAMP-differentiated cells synergistically stimulated O2- formation in the presence but not in the absence of GTP[gamma S]. We conclude that differentiations of HL-60 cells with Me2SO and dbcAMP are not equivalent with respect to activation of NADPH oxidase and that two cytosolic activation factors are involved in the regulation of this effector system.","['Seifert, R', 'Jungblut, P', 'Schultz, G']","['Seifert R', 'Jungblut P', 'Schultz G']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '59NEE7PCAB (Hexachlorocyclohexane)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hexachlorocyclohexane/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",1989/06/30 00:00,1989/06/30 00:01,['1989/06/30 00:00'],"['1989/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(89)91357-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(89)91357-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1989 Jun 30;161(3):1109-17. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(89)91357-0.,,,,,,,,,

Taq1 polymerase, a thermostable DNA polymerase, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase share similar buffer conditions; these reactions can be performed sequentially, in a single tube, without the need for purification or changes of buffer after the synthesis of cDNA. In this way, nonspecific losses of material are minimized and the required number of cells is reduced. Cell numbers, particularly from human tissues, can be limiting; the requirement for only small amounts of unfractionated RNA makes possible the isolation and characterization of cDNAs from biological materials available in limited quantities. As a demonstration system, we report the rapid synthesis and amplification of cDNA sequences corresponding to the first exon of human immunoglobulin E (IgE). MMLV reverse transcriptase is used with specific (i.e., IgE) or generic (i.e., oligo-[dT(12-18)]) oligomers to prime first strand cDNA synthesis from unfractionated RNA isolated from a human myeloma line, U-266. The necessary primers, deoxynucleotides and Taq1 polymerase, required for second strand cDNA synthesis and the subsequent logarithmic amplification process, are then added to the reaction mixture. This technique provides a useful means of characterizing expressed and processed gene transcripts.","['Doherty, P J', 'Huesca-Contreras, M', 'Dosch, H M', 'Pan, S']","['Doherty PJ', 'Huesca-Contreras M', 'Dosch HM', 'Pan S']","['Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['GM-38420/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['DNA/*genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Taq Polymerase']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-2697(89)90003-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(89)90003-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1989 Feb 15;177(1):7-10. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(89)90003-1.,,,,,,,,,

One binding site (site I) is at a position -290 to -267 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, the other (site II) is at -182 to -168 bp. Site II includes the octamer sequence (ATGCAAAT) found in an immunoglobulin enhancer and the histone H2b gene promoter. A point mutation (T----C) at -175, within the octamer sequence, is characteristic of a naturally occurring HPFH (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin), and decreases factor binding to an oligonucleotide containing the octamer motif. Expression assays using a A gamma globin promoter-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase) fusion gene show that the point mutation at -175 increases expression in erythroid, but not non-erythroid cells when compared to a wild-type construct. This correlates with the actual effect of the HPFH mutation in humans. This higher expression may result from a mechanism more complex than reduced binding of a negative regulator. A site I clustered-base substitution gives gamma-CAT activity well below wild-type, suggesting that this factor is a positive regulator.","['Lloyd, J A', 'Lee, R F', 'Lingrel, J B']","['Lloyd JA', 'Lee RF', 'Lingrel JB']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, OH 45267/0524.']",['eng'],"['12331/PHS HHS/United States', '1GM12817-01 F32/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 39585/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hemoglobinopathies/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Multigene Family', '*Mutation', 'Nucleotide Mapping', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",1989/06/12 00:00,1989/06/12 00:01,['1989/06/12 00:00'],"['1989/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/17.11.4339 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 Jun 12;17(11):4339-52. doi: 10.1093/nar/17.11.4339.,,,,,,PMC317938,,,

C depletion with anti-CD3 (OKT3) and anti-CD8 (OKT8) mAb decreased the allogeneic cytolysis of two EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) by 96% and 89%, respectively. Complement depletion with the NK cell-specific mAb Leu-11b and NKH-1a resulted in only a slight decrease (less than 35%) in the lysis of these LCL. mAb inhibition studies with OKT3 and OKT8 inhibited the allogeneic lysis of two LCL by 87% and 82%, respectively. The alloreactive cytotoxic response was strongly inhibited by mAb specific for MHC class I determinants (W6/32, 65% inhibition and BBM.1, 58% inhibition). Acute IM lymphocytes lysed the allogeneic EBV-negative cell lines HSB2 (45%) and HTLV-1 T cell lines (16%). NK cell-depleted lymphocytes from an acute IM patient demonstrated preferential lysis of K562 transfected with human HLA-A2 (73%) compared with the K562 transfected control (20%). Cold target competition studies with allogeneic and autologous target and competitor LCL demonstrated no significant competitive inhibition between allogeneic and autologous cells. We interpret these results as evidence that 1) the acute IM-alloreactive cytotoxic response is mediated primarily by CTL; 2) these alloreactive CTL lyse allogeneic target cells irrespective of EBV antigenic expression; 3) MHC class I expression is sufficient for allogeneic recognition and lysis of target cells; 4) distinct effector CTL populations mediate lysis of autologous and allogeneic target cells; and 5) during acute IM, EBV infection results in the induction of both virus-specific and alloreactive CTL populations.","['Tomkinson, B E', 'Maziarz, R', 'Sullivan, J L']","['Tomkinson BE', 'Maziarz R', 'Sullivan JL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],['AI25542/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/classification/*immunology']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jul 15;143(2):660-70.,,,,,,,,,

In addition, IL-4 can enhance CTL activity in MLC, but blocks IL-2 induced lymphokine activated killer cell activity in PBL. In our study, the cloning efficiencies, Ag-specific CTL activity and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity of CTL clones generated in IL-2 were compared to those generated in IL-4. In a first experiment, T cells were stimulated with the EBV-transformed B cell line JY and cloned 7 days later with feeder cells and either IL-2 or IL-4. In a second experiment, stimulation of the T cells was carried out in the presence of IL-2 plus anti-IL-4 antibodies or IL-4 plus anti-IL-2 antibodies in order to block the effects of IL-4 and IL-2, respectively, produced by the feeder cells. Although the cloning efficiencies in the second experiment were lower than those obtained in the first experiment, the cloning efficiencies obtained with IL-2 or IL-4 were similar in both experiments. The overall proportion of TCR alpha beta+ T cell clones cytotoxic for the stimulator cell JY established in IL-2 or IL-4 were comparable. A striking difference between the clones obtained in IL-2 or IL-4 was that a large proportion of the clones obtained in IL-4 expressed CD4 and CD8 simultaneously, whereas none of the clones isolated in IL-2 were double positive. Also gamma delta+ T cell clones could be established with IL-4 as a growth factor. TCR gamma delta+ T cell clones isolated in either IL-2 or IL-4 were CD4-CD8- or CD4-CD8+, but the proportion of CD4-CD8+ clones isolated in IL-4 was higher. Interestingly, one TCR gamma delta+ clone isolated in IL-2 was CD4+CD8-. Most of the TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ CTL-clones isolated in IL-2 lysed the NK cell sensitive target cell K562. In contrast, only a small proportion of the TCR alpha beta+ or TCR gamma delta+ CTL clones isolated in IL-4, lysed K562.

To test whether Leu-9 is indeed specific for T-cell leukemias, we examined in detail 10 cases of acute leukemia in which reactions were positive for Leu-9 and negative for other T-cell-associated markers including T-11, Leu-1, T-3, and E-rosettes. Morphologically and cytochemically, 2 of these 10 leukemias were classified as lymphoblastic, 4 as myeloblastic, 2 as monoblastic, 1 as megakaryoblastic, and 1 as undifferentiated. The case of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is the first reported case to be Leu-9 positive. None of the 10 were TdT positive. Of six cases (two monoblastic, one lymphoblastic, one myeloblastic, one megakaryoblastic, and one undifferentiated) in which we evaluated for DNA gene rearrangements, only one, a peroxidase-positive leukemia, showed a novel band on study of the T-cell-receptor beta-chain gene. We therefore conclude that Leu-9 is not a specific marker to T-cell lineage and that, in the absence of other supporting data, Leu-9 positivity should not be used as the sole basis of classifying an acute leukemia as being T-cell derived.","['Ben-Ezra, J', 'Winberg, C D', 'Wu, A', 'Rappaport, H']","['Ben-Ezra J', 'Winberg CD', 'Wu A', 'Rappaport H']","['James Irvine Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']",['eng'],"['5R01 CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1987;1(3):147-56.,,,,,,,,,

We report the cellular metabolism of DHAC and its incorporation into nucleic acids in the CCRF/CEM/O and deoxycytidine kinase mutant CCRF/CEM/dCk(-) human lymphoid cell lines. The cells were incubated with their respective IC50 concentrations for 24 h, then aliquot samples were removed at predetermined intervals and extracted for nucleotides. The acid-soluble extracts of the cells were assayed on HPLC for nucleotides of DHAC. The major anabolite of [3H]DHAC, [3H]DHACTP, peaked at 110.3 +/- 30.7 microM in CEM/O and at 96.3 +/- 41.9 microM in CEM/dCk(-) cells at 9 and 12 h, respectively. The intracellular concentrations of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, [3H]DHAdCTP, peaked at 13.5 +/- 7.7 microM at 4 h in CEM/O and at 80.8 +/- 13.8 microM at 12 h, a 6-fold greater cellular concentration, in the dCk mutant cell line. The amount of DHAC anabolites incorporated into CEM/O nucleic acids reached a plateau in RNA at 552.6 +/- 7.8 pmol/10(7) cells and in DNA at 64.55 +/- 10.0 pmol/10(7) cells. In CEM/dCk(-) cells, DHAC anabolites reached a plateau in RNA and DNA at 4,256.3 +/- 631.0 and 395.5 +/- 145.4 pmol/10(7) cells, respectively. Thus, with equitoxic treatments of DHAC, the incorporation of its analog anabolites into RNA and DNA was 8- and 6-fold greater in CEM/dCk(-) cells. DNA methylation levels were depressed equally despite a 6-fold greater incorporation of the analog in DNA in the CEM/dCk(-) cells indicating that hypomethylation may be saturated after DHAC treatment. The DNA methylation levels reached a nadir of 0.19% and 0.20% methyl-C (percentage of methylation) in the two cell lines at 6 and 12 h after the beginning of drug treatment and remained relatively constant for the duration of the 24-h treatment. A curve-linear relationship was obtained between the DNA methylation levels in both cell lines and the amounts of DHAC anabolite incorporated into DNA.","['Avramis, V I', 'Powell, W C', 'Mecum, R A']","['Avramis VI', 'Powell WC', 'Mecum RA']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90027.']",['eng'],['CA 38905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0627D8VG1C (5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00300235 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;24(3):155-60. doi: 10.1007/BF00300235.,,,,,,,,,

While in selected cases anecdotal successes have been noted with the use of hormonal therapy, some differentiation inducers, e.g. vitamin A- en D-analogues, have not hold their promises in placebo controlled trials. Attempts to induce complete remissions in MDS with antileukemic treatment have usually been unsuccessful. Toxicity is substantial and a considerable proportion of patients fare worse with chemotherapy than with standard supportive care.

Human head and neck A-253 carcinoma cells were 10-fold more sensitive to a 1-hr exposure to BLM A2 than either murine leukemic L1210 or human ovarian SK-OV cells. Both murine and human cells displayed rapid drug association with steady-state drug levels being reached within 15-30 min. At steady state, the T1/2 of drug dissociation was slow (between 65 and 155 min), unaltered by 100-fold excess of unlabeled BLM A2, and unrelated to cellular sensitivity to BLM. Approximately 15% of the total cellular drug was found in the nuclei at steady state. In intact cells, BLM hydrolase activity appeared latent; significant BLM hydrolase activity was detected using broken cell homogenates with all cell types, but no extensive drug metabolism was evident in intact cells. Murine L1210 cells differed from both human cell lines in that they had only 50% of the steady-state drug levels, had lower nuclear drug content, and had markedly less initial single-strand DNA damage. Human SK-OV cells had 2.4-fold greater initial single-strand DNA damage despite similar nuclear content and a much lower rate of DNA repair. Thus, cellular or nuclear factors, in addition to BLM A2 content, affect initial single-strand DNA damage.

Both the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of this drug have been attributed to its binding to DNA. DIT inhibits the growth and is cytotoxic to Friend erythroleukemia (FL) cells. When FL cells were treated with 0.5-2.5 microM DIT and then stained with acridine orange (AO), which differentially stains DNA and RNA, the green, orthochromatic fluorescence representing AO binding to DNA was unchanged, while the metachromatic red luminescence characteristic of AO binding to RNA was reduced by as much as 40% in 4 hr; the effect was DIT-concentration dependent. The reduction in RNA stainability by DIT in the absence of any significant decrease in RNA content, was also observed with another RNA-specific fluorochrome, pyronin Y (PY). These results indicate that in live cells DIT preferentially binds to RNA rather than DNA, preventing stainability of the former by the monointercalating dyes AO and PY. When FL cells were exposed to 10 microM DIT after being first permeabilized by ethanol, the subsequent stainability of DNA in these cells was reduced by up to 67% and RNA by up to 44%, indicating that under these conditions DIT binds to both DNA and RNA. This observation was confirmed by competition experiments between AO and DIT bound to DNA or RNA in permeabilized cells mixed with equivalent numbers of RNA-containing (DNase-treated) or DNA-containing (RNase-treated) cells, respectively. The mechanisms that protect DNA against binding by DIT in live cells are unknown but are lost in fixed cells and may be related to maintenance of cellular and/or nuclear membrane integrity. If the propensity for other intercalating drugs to bind to RNA in live cells is correlated with their antitumor activity as is DIT, the rationale for designing new drugs based solely on their affinity for DNA should be reevaluated.","['Traganos, F', 'Bueti, C', 'Kapuscinski, J', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Traganos F', 'Bueti C', 'Kapuscinski J', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Experimental Cell Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)', 'VFS4ZUK33P (ditercalinium)', 'W659G165T1 (Pyronine)']",IM,"['Acridine Orange', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carbazoles/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Intercalating Agents', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mice', 'Pyronine', 'RNA/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):522-9.,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, MLUS patients exhibited a significantly lower Leu-7/CD16 ratio as well as a higher frequency of CD16+/Leu-7- cells than healthy donors. These results suggest that B-CLL patients have higher numbers of circulating immature NK cells compared to B-MLUS, while B-MLUS patients have a larger proportion of NK cells with a high lytic capability as compared to both CLL and normal controls. The imbalance between CD4+ and CD8+ cells was prominent in CLL with a low CD4/CD8 ratio, but within the upper normal range in MLUS.

MAb to epithelial-specific keratin 18 stain a minor population of ductal epithelial cells, the major population of epithelial cells in interlobular (ILD) and extralobular terminal ducts (ETD), and epithelial cells in a minority of ductules. In lactating glands most epithelial cells in ductules are stained, but the alveolar and myoepithelial cells are unstained. Keratin MAb PKK2 and LP34 strongly stain myoepithelial cells, but only a minor population of epithelial cells in main ducts. However, these MAb stain principally the epithelial cells in ILD, ETD, and a minority of ductules. In lactating glands most epithelial cells are stained in ductules, but the myoepithelial and not the alveolar cells are stained intensely in secretory lobules. It is suggested that the unusual staining pattern of cells found principally in the ILD, ETD, and some ductules may represent regions of growth and/or subpopulation(s) of cells intermediate between epithelial and myoepithelial cells.","['Rudland, P S', 'Hughes, C M']","['Rudland PS', 'Hughes CM']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Vimentin)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Actins/immunology', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Breast/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Collagen/immunology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratins/immunology', 'Lactation', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mucin-1', 'Neprilysin', 'Pregnancy', 'Vimentin/immunology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/37.7.2471725 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1989 Jul;37(7):1087-100. doi: 10.1177/37.7.2471725.,,,,,,,,,

As controls, the blood cells from 2 normal volunteers and 3 acute monocytic leukemia (M5b) were examined. To identify monocytic cells, a double esterase (DE) staining combining with alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (ANBE) and naphthol-ASD chloroacetate esterase (N-ASD-CAE) stainings was used. According to DE staining, M4 leukemic cells were classified into ANBE positive cells, N-ASD-CAE positive cells and DE-positive cells coated vesides. Ultrastructurally, M4 leukemic cells possessed indented nuclear membrane, clusters of myeloperoxidase-positive rod-like granules, coated vesicles, abundant smooth endoplasmic vesicles and invaginated cell membrane similarly to M5b leukemic cells and normal monocytes. These features were observed not only in the ANBE positive cells but also in the DE-positive cells. The N-ASD-CAE positive cells in M4 ultrastructurally showed atypical features of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and possessed monocytic characteristics to some extents. M4 leukemic cells occasionally showed some peculiar structures such as the reticulated lamellae complex, paired cisternae and annulate lamellae. The cells showing erythrophagocytosis were either observed. Combining the results of DE staining and electron microscopy, it was suggested that M4 is closely associated with the malignant transformation of a monocyte/granulocyte precursor cell which has an ability to differentiate to both monocyte and granulocyte.","['Saito, N']",['Saito N'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Esterases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Peroxidases', 'Staining and Labeling']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1989 Mar;64(2):146-62.,,,,,,,,,

Mitomycin C also produced increased DNA-DNA crosslinking in these cells compared to parental L5178Y cells, but did not induce DNA double strand breaks in either cell line. The resistant cells have a 24-fold increased level of DT-diaphorase activity, an enzyme that produces two electron reduction of quinone groups. Dicoumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, significantly inhibited crosslinking and cytotoxicity by mitomycin C in the quinone resistant cells.

The effects of IFN on lymph node cells were compared with effects on mononuclear blood cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and healthy donors. Natural IFN-alpha (nIFN-alpha) induced a proliferative response in cells from seven of 17 of the B-cell lymphomas, in two of eight of the non-malignant lymph nodes, and in lymphoid blood cells from two of 32 CLL patients. With few exceptions, the proliferating cells were B cells and the data suggest that IFN acts directly on the B cells. Proliferation was not induced with IFN in cells from the T-cell lymphoma or in mononuclear blood cells from 13 healthy donors. nIFN-alpha induced blast transformation in cells from ten of 14 of the B-cell lymphomas and in four of seven of the non-malignant lymph nodes. Also beta- and gamma-IFN were shown to induce proliferation and blast transformation in lymph node cells from some patients. No major effect on the expression of various differentiation markers could be observed following culture in the presence of nIFN-alpha.

Recent genetic engineering enables mass production of these substances, and their clinical application in treating human cancers is expected to take place in the near future. In this paper, the recent trend of cancer treatment, using various cytokines are briefly introduced, namely interferon, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor and colony stimulating factor. Although IL-2 is effective for the activation of T-lymphocyte, intravenous injection of IL-2 is not so effective for treatment of cancer-patients. On the other hand, IL-2-activated killer cells (LAK cells) are potent effectors of adoptive immunotherapy in advanced cancer patients. The clinical study was conducted in 25 patients with advanced carcinomas. Therapeutic efficacy was obtained in patients for whom local transfer was undertaken rather than systemic administration. Tumor necrosis factor, a cytotoxin derived from macrophages shows much promise for application in cancer therapy because of its marked antitumor effects and its high specificity to tumors. Clinical study was performed on leukemia patients who showed marked decreases of percentage of leukemic cells in peripheral blood. Moreover, local injection of TNF was very effective for the decrease of tumor size in patients with hepatoma and subcutaneous tumor. In addition, to clinical results using CSF and interferon are reported.","['Urushizaki, I']",['Urushizaki I'],['Sapporo Medical College.'],['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A phase I-II trial.,976-84,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the hematopoietic effects and toxicity of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. DESIGN: The G-CSF was administered by daily subcutaneous injection to outpatients in a phase I-II trial. Dose was escalated every 2 weeks between 0.1 to 3.0 micrograms/kg body weight.d over an 8-week treatment period. SETTING: Outpatient clinical research center at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve consecutive patients with myelodysplastic syndromes: two refractory anemia, seven refractory anemia with excess of blasts, three refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 10 of 12 patients, elevations in blood leukocyte counts (2- to 10-fold) and absolute neutrophil counts (5- to 40-fold) were seen over the 8-week treatment period. Five of seven severely neutropenic patients (absolute neutrophil count, less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L) had a rise in count to 1.2 to 16.3 x 10(9)/L. Increased reticulocyte counts occurred in 5 patients, and were associated with decreased transfusion requirements in 2 of 9 erythrocyte transfusion-dependent patients. Treatment with G-CSF enhanced marrow myeloid cell maturation in 9 of 11 evaluable patients. Neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis in vitro were improved or unchanged after treatment in 6 of 8 patients tested. In 11 of 12 patients, there were no substantial changes in platelet, lymphocyte, eosinophil, or monocyte counts. Three responding patients initially had abnormal cytogenetics that persisted after G-CSF therapy, suggesting induced differentiation of the abnormal clone. The therapy was associated with minimal toxicity. None of the patients' conditions converted to acute leukemia during treatment or in short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with G-CSF administered by subcutaneous injection is well tolerated and effective for improving the neutropenia, and less commonly the transfusion-dependent anemia, over 6 to 8 weeks in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Negrin, R S', 'Haeuber, D H', 'Nagler, A', 'Olds, L C', 'Donlon, T', 'Souza, L M', 'Greenberg, P L']","['Negrin RS', 'Haeuber DH', 'Nagler A', 'Olds LC', 'Donlon T', 'Souza LM', 'Greenberg PL']","['Stanford University Medical Center, California.']",['eng'],['CA36915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/therapy', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/therapy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Erythrocyte Count/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*therapy', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Reticulocytes/drug effects']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-110-12-976 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1989 Jun 15;110(12):976-84. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-110-12-976.,,,,,,,,,

Proto-oncogene expression was also used as a tool to dissect the growth to differentiation developmental cascade. Myeloid cell growth was correlated with high c-myc and c-myb RNA levels, decreasing to undetectable levels in terminally differentiated cells. No c-myc RNA was detected in normal myeloid progenitors induced for differentiation without growth, using media conditioned by mouse granulocytes (GCM), indicating that c-myc may play either no role or an inhibitory one in differentiation. RNA levels of the proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-fes and c-fms were undetectable in normal or M1 differentiation inducible (D+) leukemic myeloblasts, and were stably induced upon stimulation of the normal precursors for growth and differentiation, with highest levels at the time when most of the cells had undergone terminal differentiation. Only c-fes RNA was induced upon M1D+ differentiation. It was also shown to be induced upon induction of differentiation without growth in normal myeloid precursors. Using c-myc and c-myb RNA suppression as molecular markers for induction of M1D+ differentiation, the existence of myeloid differentiation factor(s), distinct from myeloid growth factors, has been demonstrated. Such differentiation inducing activity was found in media conditioned by mouse lungs or granulocytes, and was induced in normal myeloid precursors by the myelopoietic growth factors IL3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF. Taken together, the results of this study enhance and add to previous work to better correlate the expression of the proto-oncogenes myc, myb, fes, fos and fms with several parameters of normal and abnormal myeloid cell growth and differentiation. The results indicate that the normal myeloid growth to differentiation developmental cascade entails a mechanism whereby myeloid growth factors induce myeloid differentiation factors, subsequently suppressing c-myc and c-myb RNA expression, leading to the induction of differentiation and growth arrest, including early accumulation of c-fes RNA followed by accumulation of c-fos and c-fms RNAs. It was also indicated that this cascade is impaired in leukemia.","['Liebermann, D A', 'Hoffman-Liebermann, B']","['Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman-Liebermann B']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/physiology', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/analysis']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 May;4(5):583-92.,,,,,,,,,

A total of 46 patients (51.1 per cent) underwent further prostate resection and no malignancy was found in any of these specimens: 43 underwent transurethral resection (24.9 gm. average), while 3 underwent open prostatectomy (97 gm. average). Other etiologies of acute retention included benign hyperplasia, other underlying illness, medical procedures, medications, prostatitis and prostatic infarction. Among the 44 patients who did not undergo prostatectomy 13 had treatment of the diagnosed cancer, 9 had resolution of retention and symptoms without intervention, 9 remained catheterized due to severe medical problems, 8 were treated for prostatitis, 2 had discontinuation of sympathomimetic drugs and 1 each underwent urethrotomy, bladder neck incision and resolution of prostatic infarction.

Removal of the T-cell fraction from spleen cells resulted in an 8- to 10-fold enhancement in the number of productively infected cells in the remaining B-cell-enriched fraction, as compared with unseparated spleen cells, and the addition of increasing numbers of purified T-cells to isolated B-cells prior to infection resulted in a directly proportional reduction in the number of B-cells releasing infectious progeny virus. Separation of splenic T-cells into Lyt 2- and Lyt 2+ T-cells before addition to infected B-cell cultures resulted in inhibition of infection only with the Lyt 2- T-cells; Lyt 2+ T-cells did not inhibit infection, even at high 1:1 ratios. Similarly, separation of splenic T-cells into L3T4+ and L3T4- T-cells before addition resulted in inhibition by L3T4+ but not L3T4- T-cells. Also, cytotoxic treatment of splenic T-cells with monoclonal anti-L3T4 antibody and complement before addition to B-cell cultures destroyed the regulatory effects. Finally, depletion of macrophages from both T-cells and B-cells before infection and coculture had no effect on the ability of T-cells to regulate B-cell infection.

The results showed that 0% (0/29, 5-azacytidine), 6.8% (2/29, MNNG) and 87.5% (28/32, DM-Cl) of the resulting clones were highly immunogenic, as judged by their tumorigenicity in intact compared to immunodepressed hosts. Frequency distribution analysis of the 5-methylcytosine content of drug-treated and parental clones showed that the methylation pattern was not significantly modified by tumor exposure to either 5-azacytidine or MNNG, and the two immunogenic clones induced by MNNG had methylcytosine levels very close to the 50th percentile value. In contrast, the extent of DNA methylation was increased in the cells treated with DM-Cl, but no obvious association was found between methylation status and immunogenicity of the drug-treated clones. In four 5-azacytidine-treated clones that displayed little or no immunogenicity, additional rounds of drug exposure led to progressive DNA demethylation, but failed, as a rule, to enhance tumor cell immunogenicity. Taken together, the present data indicate that, at least for the examined tumor, immunogenic variants are generated by mutagen treatment at high (MNNG) or very high (DM-Cl) frequencies under conditions in which hypomethylation-induced antigen amplification is unlikely.","['Fuschiotti, P', 'Fioretti, M C', 'Romani, L', 'Puccetti, P']","['Fuschiotti P', 'Fioretti MC', 'Romani L', 'Puccetti P']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Science, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Triazenes)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '70303-37-6 (1-(4-carbethoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-3-methyltriazene)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Clone Cells/classification/drug effects/transplantation', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Mutagens', 'Phenotype', 'Triazenes/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199289 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1989;29(2):139-43. doi: 10.1007/BF00199289.,,,,,,,,,

Histological examination of the tumors treated with nHuTNF-beta revealed that the tumor size and number of metastases were much reduced. Lytic cellular changes, including cytoplasmic vacuolation, loosening of the intercellular junction and both cytoplasmic and nuclear swelling, were found, but tumor necrosis was not. These findings indicate a therapeutic effect of Grade IIa according to the histological criteria of Shimosato and Ohboshi. In addition, synergistic augmentation of the antiproliferative effects of nHuTNF-beta by natural murine interferon-alpha/beta (nMu-IFN-alpha/beta) or recombinant murine interferon-gamma (rMuIFN-gamma) was recognized by median effect plot analysis.

Induction of differentiation in M1 leukemic colonies by both LIF and IL-6 was enhanced by the addition of G-CSF or M-CSF but not by GM-CSF or Multi-CSF. Both G-CSF and IL-6, but not LIF, were able to induce differentiation in murine WEHI-3B leukemic colonies, but G-CSF was 10-fold more efficient than IL-6. Both G-CSF and IL-6 were able to stimulate the proliferation of cells of the NFS-60 continuous cell line, but G-CSF was 30-fold more efficient.

The similarities in the biology and actions of G-CSF, LIF, and IL-6 suggest that they may be designed to exhibit coordinated biological functions in certain situations.","['Metcalf, D']",['Metcalf D'],"['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', '*Lymphokines', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):349-55.,,,,,,,,,

Several divalent cations increase the affinity of many G-protein-coupled receptors for agonists at concentrations in the millimolar range. Micromolar concentrations of Mg2+ are required for receptor-mediated activation of G-proteins. Using the formyl peptide receptor of human leukemia (HL 60) as a model system, we have recently been able to demonstrate that two independent metal binding sites are present on the receptor-G-protein complex to mediate these two effects. We propose that the site that binds divalent cations in the millimolar range is contained in an extracellular domain of the receptor, whereas the site for micromolar Mg2+ is located on the G-protein. Sodium ions decrease the agonist affinity of many G-protein-coupled receptors and modify the interaction of G-proteins with guanine nucleotides. We suggest that sodium ions elicit these effects by interacting with a unique binding site present in an intracellular domain of either the receptor or some associated protein that is different from the G-protein.","['Gierschik, P', 'McLeish, K', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Gierschik P', 'McLeish K', 'Jakobs KH']","['Pharmokologisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, F.R.G.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,7902492,"['0 (Ions)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ions/*metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 1988;12 Suppl 5:S20-4.,45,,,,,,,,

The cell surface expression of these glycoproteins during normal and erythroid differentiation has been investigated with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and has been compared to the expression of glycophorin A (GPA), the major sialoglycoprotein of human red cells. Using glycosylation-independent antibodies (monoclonal or polyclonal), GPC or GPD was detected in erythroid and nonerythroid cell lineages. However, a glycosylation-dependent monoclonal antibody (MR4-130) detected an epitope on GPC which appears to be erythroid specific, suggesting that lineage specificity of this glycoprotein is related to some carbohydrate structures. During normal erythroid differentiation, GPC was expressed early at the level of erythroid progenitors (part of erythroid burst-forming unit and erythroid colony-forming unit) as detected with a glycosylation-independent monoclonal antibody (APO 3), whereas GPA is only present during terminal erythroid differentiation. The MR4-130 epitope was not coordinately expressed on the cell surface with the GPC molecule in the erythroid differentiation, since it was detected at the level of the more mature erythroid colony-forming unit slightly later than the GPC polypeptide. In four erythroleukemic patients, blast cells blocked at discrete stages of the erythroid differentiation were also investigated with antibodies and complementary DNA probes for GPA and GPC. GPA was immunologically detected in three of four cases, and its cell surface expression was correlated with the amount of specific mRNA in the cells, as seen by Northern blot analysis. GPC was immunologically detected on the blast cells of all four patients. However, in two cases including one with positive expression of GPA, the MR4-130 epitope was absent from the GPC molecule. By Northern blot analysis, we found that the GPC/GPD mRNA was present at a high level in all four patient samples. Western blot analysis of GPC and GPD in two of these patients revealed that these mRNAs were mostly translated into the GPD molecule, suggesting that these glycoproteins might be differently processed in certain cases of erythroleukemia.","['Villeval, J L', 'Le Van Kim, C', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Debili, N', 'Colin, Y', 'el Maliki, B', 'Blanchard, D', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Cartron, J P']","['Villeval JL', 'Le Van Kim C', 'Bettaieb A', 'Debili N', 'Colin Y', 'el Maliki B', 'Blanchard D', 'Vainchenker W', 'Cartron JP']","['Unite Inserm U91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Bone Marrow/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Erythrocytes/analysis/*pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Glycophorins/*analysis/immunology', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*analysis']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 May 15;49(10):2626-32.,,,,,,,,,

In the blood, Fc gamma R I is expressed exclusively on monocytes and macrophages, Fc gamma R II on granulocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, platelets, and B cells, and Fc gamma R III on granulocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. We have examined the expression of these molecules on normal bone marrow (BM) cells and on leukemia cells from the blood and/or BM in order to determine their normal ontogeny as well as their distribution on leukemic cells. BM was obtained from six normal volunteers and from 170 patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Normal BM cells were found to express Fc gamma R I, II, and III with the following percentages: 40%, 58%, and 56%, respectively. Cell sorting revealed that both Fc gamma R I and Fc gamma R II were detectable on all subclasses of myeloid precursors as early as myeloblasts. Cell sorting experiments revealed that 66% of the granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) and 50% of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) were Fc gamma R II positive with only 20% and 28%, respectively, of CFU-GM and BFU-E were Fc gamma R I positive. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressed the three receptors with the following frequency (n = 146): Fc gamma R I, 58%; Fc gamma R II, 67%; and Fc gamma R III, 26% of patients. Despite the fact that Fc gamma R I is only expressed on monocytes among blood cells, AML cells without monocytoid differentiation (French-American-British [FAB]M1, M2, M3, M6) were sometimes positive for this receptor. However, Fc gamma R I was highly correlated with FAB M4 and M5 morphology (P less than .001). Fc gamma R II was also correlated with FAB M4 and M5 morphology (P = .003). Cells from 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were negative for Fc gamma R I, but six cases were positive for Fc gamma R II and III (not the same patients). These studies demonstrate that Ig Fc gamma R are acquired during normal differentiation in the BM at or before the level of colony-forming units. In addition, we show that acute leukemia cells commonly express Fc gamma R.","['Ball, E D', 'McDermott, J', 'Griffin, J D', 'Davey, F R', 'Davis, R', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Ball ED', 'McDermott J', 'Griffin JD', 'Davey FR', 'Davis R', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",['eng'],"['CA 23108-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA3702/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*analysis/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/analysis/classification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Staining and Labeling']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75511-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 15;73(7):1951-6.,,,,,,,,,

Membrane expression of ICAM-1 is highly regulated on all hematopoietic lineages. Cell membrane antigen is significantly expressed on a small subset of bone marrow (BM) progenitors but is weak or absent on all cell lineages once they enter the circulation. However, strong expression on tissue macrophages and germinal center B cells suggested that activated cells may show upregulated expression. When B cells, T cells, macrophages, or granulocytes were activated in vitro by suitable mitogens, ICAM-1 expression was induced in all cases. Parallel studies of hematopoietic tumors demonstrated a heterogeneity of expression which correlated with expression on their normal cellular counterparts. In particular, a striking correlation between expression on B-cell tumors and corresponding stages of B-cell differentiation was noted. The widely varying expression of ICAM-1 contrasts with LFA-1 which, while variable, is nevertheless significantly positive at all stages of differentiation. This suggests that the major regulation of homotypic adhesion mediated by the LFA-1/ICAM-1 linkage occurs through control of ICAM-1 expression. In keeping with this notion, ICAM-1 expression was also correlated with the ""adhesiveness"" of B-lymphoid tumors. Large solitary lymphoma masses showed intense expression of ICAM-1. Conversely, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and lymphoma cells from tumors exhibiting diffuse, widespread lymph node disease showed weak expression. These observations are discussed in relation to the role of ICAM-1 in regulation of lymphoid recirculation and the biology of lymphoid tumors.","['Boyd, A W', 'Dunn, S M', 'Fecondo, J V', 'Culvenor, J G', 'Duhrsen, U', 'Burns, G F', 'Wawryk, S O']","['Boyd AW', 'Dunn SM', 'Fecondo JV', 'Culvenor JG', 'Duhrsen U', 'Burns GF', 'Wawryk SO']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/analysis/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoid Tissue/analysis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75504-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 15;73(7):1896-903.,,,,,,,,,

For example, the proteases of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the visna lentivirus with which it is often compared are as different as the proteases of fungi and mammals, and those of the human type I leukemia virus are as different from HIV or visna as are the proteins of humans and bacteria. That the sequences of retrovirus proteins can be recognized as sharing common ancestry with non-retroviral proteins implies that the vastly accelerated change has begun only recently or occurs very sporadically. Only a scheme whereby exogenous retroviruses exist as short-lived bursts upon a backdrop of germline-encoded endogenous viruses is consistent with the sequence data. Retroviruses are related to many other reverse transcriptase-bearing entities present in the genomes of eukaryotes. They also have proteins that are homologous with those of some plant and animal DNA viruses, and their reverse transcriptase is recognizably similar to sequences found in the introns of some fungal mitochondria.

Both RTs commit an error approximately once for every 30,000 nucleotides polymerized. DNA sequence analysis of mutants generated in a forward mutation assay capable of detecting many types of errors demonstrated that avian myeloblastosis virus RT produced a variety of different mutations. The majority (58%) were single-base substitutions; all of which resulted from the misincorporation of either dAMP or dGMP. Minus-one frameshifts were also common, composing about 30% of the mutations. In addition to single-base events, eight mutants contained sequence changes involving from 2 to 59 bases. The frequency of these mutants suggests that, at least during DNA synthesis in vitro, RTs also commit errors by mechanisms other than classical base miscoding and misalignment. We examined the ability of RTs to synthesize DNA from a mismatched primer terminus at a sequence where the mismatched base was complementary to the next base in the template. Unlike cellular DNA polymerases which polymerize from the mismatched template-primer, RTs preferred to polymerize from a rearranged template-primer containing a matched terminal base pair and an unpaired base in the template strand. The unusual preference for this substrate suggests that the interactions between RTs and the template-primer are different from those of cellular DNA polymerases. The overall error rate of RT in vitro is sufficient to account for the estimated mutation rate of these viruses.","['Roberts, J D', 'Preston, B D', 'Johnston, L A', 'Soni, A', 'Loeb, L A', 'Kunkel, T A']","['Roberts JD', 'Preston BD', 'Johnston LA', 'Soni A', 'Loeb LA', 'Kunkel TA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology/genetics']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.2.469-476.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Feb;9(2):469-76. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.2.469-476.1989.,,,,,,PMC362622,,,

Contact with the culture surface produced a delta psi p hyperpolarization directly proportional to average distance among the ideal centers of the cells on this surface (d) within the range 10-80 microns. A detailed mathematical analysis of the function delta psi p = f(d) is presented, as well as experiments involving the use of ionophores (valinomycin and A23187) and the conditioning of the culture surface. We concluded that the d-dependent hyperpolarization (dDH) was the result of a complex interplay between the activating properties of substratum on Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (KCa) and some substratum-adherent factors that are shed by MEL cells and antagonize KCa activation (substratum-attached cellular factors = SACF). By contrast, contact of the cells with each other, obtained by incubating MEL cells at d smaller than the average cell diameter (phi = 10 microns), produced a marked delta psi p depolarization. This intercellular contact-dependent depolarization (ICDD) was unaffected by valinomycin; it was abolished by substituting Na+ in the external medium with a nondiffusible cation (choline), which shows that ICDD was sustained by Na+ influxes, probably mediated by stretch-activated (s.a.) cation channels.","['Arcangeli, A', 'Riccarda Del Bene, M', 'Poli, R', 'Ricupero, L', 'Olivotto, M']","['Arcangeli A', 'Riccarda Del Bene M', 'Poli R', 'Ricupero L', 'Olivotto M']","['Institute of General Pathology, Medical Faculty, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cations/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophysiology', 'Extracellular Space/*physiology', 'Ion Channels/*physiology', 'Ions', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Potassium Channels/*physiology', 'Sodium/physiology', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041390102 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1989 Apr;139(1):1-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041390102.,,,,,,,,,

RNase H activities were measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, employing a short substrate, (A)12:d[G-G-(T)12-G-G], or by acid-solubility techniques, using a long substrate, poly(A):poly(dT). Strand exchanges which could be responsible for the observed inhibition have been ruled out by S1 nuclease experiments and by using inhibitors which do not allow strand exchange. Our results suggest that RNase H, for which DNA:RNA duplexes are the natural substrates, binds to non-physiological alpha-DNA:RNA hybrids and is consequently inhibited. These hybrids also inhibit the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of M-MLV reverse transcriptase, therefore appearing as potential inhibitors of at least two reverse transcriptase activities. However, the inhibitory effect of these hybrids with respect to M-MLV reverse transcriptase is also observed with the single-stranded alpha-DNA itself. Unexpectedly, polymerase activity is highly stimulated by alpha-oligos, analogous in their sequence to the beta primer used at a concentration unable to generate a detectable synthesis. These results suggest that the inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity with the alpha:beta may occur at different levels.","['Bloch, E', 'Lavignon, M', 'Bertrand, J R', 'Pognan, F', 'Morvan, F', 'Malvy, C', 'Rayner, B', 'Imbach, J L', 'Paoletti, C']","['Bloch E', 'Lavignon M', 'Bertrand JR', 'Pognan F', 'Morvan F', 'Malvy C', 'Rayner B', 'Imbach JL', 'Paoletti C']","['UA 147 CNRS, U 140 INSERM, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/*pharmacology', 'Drosophila/embryology/enzymology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endoribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA/*pharmacology', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Ribonuclease H']",1988/12/10 00:00,1988/12/10 00:01,['1988/12/10 00:00'],"['1988/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1119(88)90162-X [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(88)90162-x [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1988 Dec 10;72(1-2):349-60. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(88)90162-x.,,,,,,,,,

Myoepithelial-cell differentiation was monitored by quantifying cells showing immunoreactivity to the muscle isoform of actin; to the membrane glycoprotein common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA); and to type IV collagen. Growth was quantified either by measuring the actual increase in cell number, or in a more-sensitive assay using immunoreactivity to the cell-proliferation-associated nuclear antigen Ki-67 as a measurement of the number of cells leaving the G0-phase of the cell cycle. The results showed that: (a) Primary cultures of myoepithelial cells on DME-F12 supplemented with cholera toxin (CT) alone resulted in the formation of quiescent cell islets (in the G0-phase of the cell cycle) showing phenotypic traits preserved from the in vivo situation (actin- and CALLA-positive cells with little or no type-IV-collagen immunoreactivity). (b) After addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF), with an ED50 of 1-10 ng/ml, in the presence of CT, the cells entered the G1-phase of the cell cycle, without further increase in cell number. At the same ED50 of EGF, the frequency of CALLA-positive cells decreased, while the number of cells immunoreactive for type IV collagen increased with a maximal effect of EGF seen after 7-11 days. During the same period, the cells remained fully differentiated with respect to actin immunoreactivity. (c) Further addition of insulin (I) to the medium in the presence of EGF and CT resulted in the cells entering an exponential growth phase associated with simultaneous decrease in actin immunoreactivity with a maximal effect of I after 11 days of exposure. The dose-response curve to I was virtually identical for stimulating cell proliferation and for reducing the frequency of actin-immunoreactive cells (ED50 in the range of 30 ng/ml), suggesting that the two processes were controlled by the same initial I-receptor interaction. (d) Some reduction in the number of actin-positive cells was exerted by I-EGF-CT independently of the mitogenic response, but this reduction was further augmented if the cells were allowed to proliferate. (e) Time-course studies of quiescent (G0-phase) cells stimulated to exponential growth revealed that entrance of cells into the G1-phase of the cell cycle preceded the loss of muscle actin filaments.

Aplastic anemia plasma (AAP) from these mice was found to inhibit granulocyte-macrophage colony (GM-CFU) formation. This inhibitory action was not strain specific and was not generated in donor:host combination involving other strains. AAP also inhibited the formation of colonies derived from leukemic cell lines. Though this activity inhibited GM-CFU, it did not affect erythroid colony formation. Two experiments were performed to examine the mechanism of inhibition. Superoptimal concentrations of recombinant mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not reverse AAP-induced inhibition of colony formation. Bone marrow cells preincubated with AAP for 24 h and washed were unchanged in their ability to form GM-CFU colonies. Thus, the inhibitory activity acted neither as a competitive nor a cytotoxic agent. Interferons and certain prostaglandins, known to inhibit colony formation, were not found in active concentrations in AAP. The inhibitory activity of AAP was heat stable, nondialyzable, inextractable with chloroform, precipitable with 50% ammonium sulfate, and had a molecular weight of 100,000 daltons. In contrast, control plasma from mice given only sublethal irradiation and injected with saline had significantly less inhibitory activity, which was not heat stable and was extractable with chloroform. Thus, LNC in certain host mouse strains generate a plasma activity that can inhibit the formation of normal and leukemic GM-CFU colonies.","['Chiu, K M', 'Knospe, W H']","['Chiu KM', 'Knospe WH']","[""Department of Medicine, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*blood/etiology', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*blood/metabolism/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Interferons', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Prostaglandins', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 May;17(4):335-9.,,,,,,,,,

Positive identification of homologous pol sequences was made in the amplified DNA from six of these patients (29%).

In contrast, none of the samples from 35 normal individuals studied was positive when amplified and tested with the same primers and probes. Comparison of patterns obtained from controls and from patients with adult T-cell leukemia or tropical spastic paraparesis suggests that the DNA sequences identified are exogenous to the human genome and may correspond to a human retroviral species.

Ly-31.1, i.e., mouse alkaline phosphatase, was expressed predominantly in kidney and bone and was also detected in placenta, lung, and testis. Concerning tumor cell lines, they varied in the amount of antigen present, with both T and B lymphoid lineages selectively possessing the antigen. In normal lymphoid tissues, lesser amounts of antigen were detected. The binding of mouse alkaline phosphatase to Ly-31.1-specific monoclonal antibodies was specific in nature. The Ly-31.1 antigen was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of surface-radiolabeled YAC-1 moloney leukemia cells, and appeared as a single band of about 78,000 under both reduced and nonreduced conditions on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, treatment of tumor cell lines with phosphatidylinositol-specific-phospholipase C resulted in the removal of Ly-31 antigen from the cell surface.

In this study, it is demonstrated that interleukin (IL) 4 down-regulates the surface expression of CD5 on tonsil B cells and B-CLL cells, but not on T cells. IL 4 inhibits both the spontaneous and the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced hyperexpression of CD5 on tonsil B cells. In contrast, IL 4 only suppresses the PMA-induced hyperexpression of CD5 on B-CLL, whereas the spontaneous CD5 expression is essentially unaffected. The IL 4 concentrations required to down-regulate CD5 are the same as those required to up-regulate CD23. The IL 4-mediated down-regulation of CD5 is an intrinsic property of this IL, since an anti-IL 4-neutralizing antiserum blocks this effect. Interferon (IFN)-gamma, which inhibits the IL 4 induced CD23 expression, does not block the IL 4-induced down-regulation of CD5. Recombinant IL 1 alpha, IL 2, IL 3, IL 5, IL 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IFN-gamma and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor neither inhibit nor stimulate CD5 expression on B cells, therefore suggesting that the capacity to down-regulate CD5 expression on B cells is specific to IL 4.","['Defrance, T', 'Vanbervliet, B', 'Durand, I', 'Banchereau, J']","['Defrance T', 'Vanbervliet B', 'Durand I', 'Banchereau J']","['UNICET, Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830190212 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Feb;19(2):293-9. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830190212.,,,,,,,,,

The unoccupied binding capacity of proteins was demonstrated by addition of surplus lysozyme. The sensitivity of immunoblotting to the free enzyme in human albumin solution was less than 5 ng. In serum and pleural fluid, part of exogenous lysozyme was bound to alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-M). At high concentrations of lysozyme in leukemic sera, part of the enzyme formed an endogenous alpha 2-M complex. On the other hand, the formation of alpha 2-M complexes with exogenous lysozyme was especially striking in sera from nephrotic patients with elevated alpha 2-M. The findings corroborate with previous reports on lysozyme binding to purified alpha 2-M in vitro and suggest that the binding is concentration-dependent with respect to both reaction partners. In vivo the mechanism may provide a pathway for extrarenal lysozyme catabolism medicated by reticuloendothelial cells. No other binding proteins were seen in the present study: lysozyme did not bind to serum immunoglobulins in 35 samples with an immunoglobulin paraprotein, three samples with polyclonally elevated gamma-globulins, 20 other patient sera and 10 normal sera. Neither did lysozyme bind to urinary proteins in five samples from patients with myeloic leukemias nor in 10 samples from myeloma patients with urinary excretion of a monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain.","['Morsky, P']",['Morsky P'],"['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/blood/urine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/urine', 'Muramidase/*analysis/blood/urine', 'Nephrosis/blood', 'Pleura/metabolism', 'Pleurisy/blood/urine', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/*analysis/blood/urine']",1988/12/30 00:00,1988/12/30 00:01,['1988/12/30 00:00'],"['1988/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-8981(88)90241-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-8981(88)90241-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 1988 Dec 30;178(3):327-36. doi: 10.1016/0009-8981(88)90241-0.,,,,,,,,,

The HL-60 cell line was chosen for study because of its ability to differentiate along either a granulocytic or monocytic pathway under appropriate culture conditions. Differentiation was determined by changes in cell morphology, nonspecific esterase (NSE) content, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, and expression of the cell surface differentiation antigens LeuM3 (CD14) and OKM1 (CD11). Using a model system in which HL-60 cells were cultured in medium that selectively lacked one amino acid (AA), it was seen that deprivation of HL-60 cells for essential (but not nonessential) AAs results in decreased cell growth and viability and in differentiation of 30% to 60% of the surviving population of cells specifically along the monocytic pathway. This differentiation is irreversible as well as time- and dose-dependent. Culture of HL-60 cells in essential AA-deficient medium potentiated the differentiative effects of recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), all of which have previously been shown to induce monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Differentiated cells had decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, but protein synthesis was unchanged compared with control cells. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prevented differentiation, indicating the necessity of protein synthesis in this process. Cell cycle analysis revealed that an increased proportion of cells cultured in AA-deficient medium was arrested in G0-G1 (80% and 50% for AA-deficient and control cells, respectively). These results suggest that alterations of AA metabolism and subsequent perturbations in DNA and RNA synthesis may be important in initiating differentiation or in augmenting cytokine-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells into more mature, nonreplicating, monocyte-like cells.","['Nichols, K E', 'Weinberg, J B']","['Nichols KE', 'Weinberg JB']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration, Durham, NC 27705.']",['eng'],"['1P50-AR39162/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', '5730-CA09307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI23308/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acids, Essential)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['*Amino Acids, Essential/metabolism/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Arginine/physiology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/biosynthesis', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/analysis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75557-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Apr;73(5):1298-306.,,,,,,,,,

Among 192 patients (26%) with T lineage ALL, 47 (6%; 24% of T lineage ALL) had lymphoblasts without sheep erythrocyte rosette formation, but with pan-T antigen CD7 on the membrane and intracellular CD3 proteins mostly in perinuclear accumulation. The T-cell surface antigens CD5 and/or CD2 and focal acid phosphatase were additional markers of this subgroup traditionally called pre-T ALL, whereas thymocyte antigen CD1 as well as CD4 and CD8 antigens were not expressed. Hematopoietic progenitor cell markers, namely terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and in part common ALL antigen (CD10), HLA-DR antigens, and/or My-10 (CD34), a unique antigen of marrow cells absent in thymus cells, further characterized this immature T-ALL form of putative prothymocytic phenotype (CD7+/intracellular CD3+/TdT+/My-10+/-/HLA-DR+/-/CD10+/-). The prethymic T cell character was supported by germ-line T-cell receptor beta genes found in 21 of 36 patients analyzed. In five cases only T gamma-chain genes were rearranged. Fifteen patients, however, had rearrangements of both T beta and T gamma genes. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were rearranged only in two cases. Pre-T ALL differed significantly from E-rosette+ T-ALL in some presenting clinical features, namely mediastinal mass, lymphoadenopathy, and platelet count, and independently of clinical factors in prognosis (P = .02, median remission duration: 15.7 v 33.5 months, and P = .02, median survival time: 24.6 v 50.7 months). We conclude that ALL classification based solely on T- or B-cell lineage affiliation is not sufficient but needs further subdivision according to relevant maturation stages as exemplified here within the T-cell axis.

A 3-hr exposure of L1210 leukemia cells to 100 microM 7-OH-MTX produced negligible suppression of cell growth despite the build-up of intracellular polyglutamyl congeners to levels 2.7 times greater than the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) binding capacity. There was no evidence for direct inhibition of DHFR under these conditions based upon measurements of cellular tetrahydrofolate cofactor and dihydrofolate levels, nor was there suppression of [3H]deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA or [14C]formate incorporation into purines. When the interval of exposure to 100 microM 7-OH-MTX was increased to 6 hr, cell growth was inhibited by 60% and there was mild (approximately 50%) inhibition of purine and thymidylate biosynthesis associated with a small increase in cellular dihydrofolate and a small decline in cellular tetrahydrofolates. Consistent with weak inhibition of DHFR was the absence of significant binding of 7-OH-MTX polyglutamates to DHFR as assessed by gel filtration of cell extracts. Mild direct inhibition of purine biosynthetics by 7-OH-MTX- or MTX-polyglutamyl congeners was demonstrated based upon inhibition of [14C]formate incorporation into purines in cells pretreated with fluorodeoxyuridine so as to prevent tetrahydrofolate cofactor depletion or dihydrofolate polyglutamate build-up. Effects of a 6-hr exposure of cells to 100 microM 7-OH MTX on cell growth were reversed completely by 10 microM leucovorin; effects on cells containing comparable levels of MTX polyglutamyl congeners were unaffected by leucovorin. These studies demonstrate very weak inhibition of L1210 leukemia cell growth and purine, pyrimidine and tetrahydrofolate synthesis by the polyglutamyl congeners of 7-OH-MTX. The data suggest that effects of 7-OH-MTX polyglutamates on folate-requiring enzymes are not likely to play an important role in moderate-dose MTX regimens. However, pharmacologic activity may be expressed in high-dose MTX protocols when high blood levels of 7-OH-MTX are sustained over long intervals to the extent to which polyglutamate congeners accumulate in tumor cells and add to the much more potent inhibitory effects of MTX polyglutamates already present. Pharmacologic activity, however, would be diminished, if not completely reversed, by the concurrent administration of leucovorin.","['Seither, R L', 'Rape, T J', 'Goldman, I D']","['Seither RL', 'Rape TJ', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Formates)', '0YIW783RG1 (formic acid)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Formates/metabolism', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(89)90236-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90236-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Mar 1;38(5):815-22. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90236-0.,,,,,,,,,

The actions of G-CSF are mediated through a small number of specific cellular receptors which are induced to internalize and accumulate within the cell after binding of G-CSF at 37 degrees C. G-CSF receptors can be lost from the cell surface not only by binding G-CSF, but indirectly by other factors including GM-CSF, Multi-CSF, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, chemotactic peptides and phorbol esters, depending on cell type.

Altogether, 680 cases of histologically defined childhood malignancies were recorded during the 14.5 years from 1971 to 1985. The frequencies of the various tumours were compared with past data and with published data from other countries. The incidence of malignancies in Papua New Guinean children appeared to be low, 36.5/1,000,000/year, with a male:female ratio of 1.6:1. Lymphoma was the most commonly occurring tumour and Burkitt's tumour accounted for 53% in this group. The relative frequency of leukaemia compared with lymphoma appeared to have increased since a previous report.

Analysis for endogenous retroviral antibodies in bone marrow plasma.,410-6,"Two unusual cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia-hand mirror variant (ALL-HMV) are presented. One patient demonstrated a mixed immunophenotype with HLA-DR, My7, transferrin receptor surface markers, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positivity. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first ALL-HMV reported with myeloid antigen. The patient died during induction and did not demonstrate the indolent course noted in the female subgroup with this disorder. The second case initially was not an ALL-HMV but presented as a non-T non-B ALL, and the patient had a relapse six years later with numerous hand mirror cells (HMCs). In the authors' experience, this is the first case of ALL that presented as a non-HMC and relapsed as an ALL-HMV. The patient's immunophenotype revealed he was HLA-DR, transferrin receptor, and TdT positive. Both patients' leukemic cells showed a diffuse granular periodic acid-Schiff on a clear background and acid phosphatase-positive pattern. Immunogenetics revealed a clonal rearrangement of one of the two Ig heavy chain loci in the one patient evaluated. Western blot analysis of the bone marrow plasma of both patients with ALL-HMV showed an increase of cross-reactive IgG to the envelope gp70 and IgM against the core p30 proteins of the baboon endogenous virus (BaEV) and simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV). Furthermore, their bone marrow plasma demonstrated IgM antibodies to the gp70 that were not present in any of the other non-hand mirror leukemic patients or the normal controls. These findings strengthen the concept that HMCs in ALL are formed in relation to an immunologic response to increased proteins related to BaEV and/or SSAV.","['Schumacher, H R', 'Desai, S N', 'McClain, K L', 'Domenico, D R', 'Dizikes, G J', 'Bird, M L']","['Schumacher HR', 'Desai SN', 'McClain KL', 'Domenico DR', 'Dizikes GJ', 'Bird ML']","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University of Chicago Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/analysis/*microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Chromosome Banding', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*microbiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Sarcoma Virus, Woolly Monkey/immunology', 'Staining and Labeling']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/91.4.410 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1989 Apr;91(4):410-6. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/91.4.410.,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two cases (86%) showed strong myeloperoxidase (MPO), chloroacetate esterase (Es-chl) and Sudan black B (SBB) positivity, suggesting a pure neutrophilic differentiation of the leukemic cells. However, in 5 out of 37 cases, a strong, diffuse alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (Es-a) positivity, which was sensitive to sodium fluoride treatment was observed in addition to strong MPO, Es-chl and SBB positivity. This suggested monocytic differentiation of a proportion of APML cases. In 31 cases, surface marker studies were carried out with the help of a panel of monoclonal antibodies consisting of two panmyeloid antibodies (GM 58/8 and 1G10), one anti-HLA-DR antibody (7.2) and one 'myeloid' antibody (5F1) with restricted reactivity with monocytes (CD14). The purpose of including the monoclonal antibodies 5F1 and 7.2 was to determine if a correlation could be established between strong Es-a positivity and reactivity of the leukemic promyelocytes with 5F1 and 7.2 in individual cases. All the 5 cases with 'monocytoid' cytochemistry were unreactive with 5F1, and only one case in this group showed 15% 7.2-positive cells. The lack of immunophenotypic support for the monocytic cytochemistry of the 5 cases of APML suggests that the monocytic phenotype of leukemic promyelocytes is both aberrant and incomplete. Since normal promyelocytes are purely neutrophilic, this could be a manifestation of an 'intralineage infidelity' in APML, similar to that observed in other types of acute leukemia. The clinical significance of 'monocytic' phenotype of APML is not clear; cases with monocytic differentiation did not show different clinical and hematological features when compared to the more common, pure neutrophilic variety.","['Das Gupta, A', 'Sapre, R S', 'Shah, A S', 'Advani, S H', 'Nair, C N']","['Das Gupta A', 'Sapre RS', 'Shah AS', 'Advani SH', 'Nair CN']","['P.D.

The leukemic cells have a translocation between chromosomes 1 and 14, t(1;14)(p33;q11), which we have molecularly cloned and sequenced. Initial screening used joining (J)-segment probes from the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha- and delta-chain loci. In apparent concert with the translocation, a deletion has occurred between delta-chain diversity (D)-region genes D delta 1 and D delta 2. D delta 2 was observed on derivative chromosome 1 [der(1)] and D delta 1 on der(14) with a deletion of the intervening 10 kilobases of germ-line DNA. The nature of the D delta 1-D delta 2 deletional event implicates a lymphoid recombinase in the mechanism of the translocation. As a consequence of the translocation, an unusual fusion transcript was generated. Probes from chromosome 1 detected a previously unreported transcript in RNA from both the cell line and the patient. A chromosome 14 probe identified the same transcript, thus confirming a fusion transcript derived from both chromosomes 1 and 14.

In hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH), inappropriately high gamma-globin expression in adult life is associated with deletions in the beta-globin cluster or with single-base changes upstream of the gamma-globin genes. To account for enhanced gamma-gene expression in HPFH of the non-deletion type, we tested the nuclear proteins of human erythroleukaemia cells that bind gamma-promoter sequences in vitro by correlating specific mutations in their binding sites with promoter activity. An erythroid-specific factor (GF-1) binds as a single molecule to the -195 to -170 region and contacts two TATCT(AGATA) motifs, but not the conserved octamer (ATGCAAAT) that separates them. We observe that a single change (at -175, T----C) found in HPFH leads to increased promoter activity only in erythroid cells. This effect is mediated by GF-1, the human counterpart of the chicken erythroid factor Eryf 1.

To investigate the mechanism of autocrine stimulation, 25 clones were isolated after retrovirus transduction of IL3 into 32D-cl23 or FDC-P1 cells. Medium conditioned by these autonomous IL3-producing clones supported the growth of factor-dependent 32D cells. Although there was a severalfold variation in the amount of IL3 secreted (some clones secreted barely detectable levels), the doubling time of each clone in the absence of added IL3 was identical to that of the parental cell line maximally stimulated by exogenous IL3. Concentrated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, both highly effective in neutralizing exogenous IL3, were assayed for ability to inhibit autocrine growth. Minimal inhibitory effects were observed only on washed autocrine clones secreting low levels of IL3. To test the activity of cytoplasmically synthesized IL3, the nucleotides encoding the signal sequence of IL3 were deleted and replaced with an in-frame ATG in the context of a consensus translation initiation sequence.

Despite the presence of biologically active IL3 in cell lysates, all clones remained dependent on exogenous IL3, with the same dose-response as that found for 32D cells.

Parameters analyzed were the suppression of stem cell generation using sequential clonal cultures, alterations of surface antigen expression, and morphological changes. When acting alone, LIF had no observable effects on the number, size, or morphology of colonies formed by HL60 or U937 cells, surface phenotype expression, or recloning capacity of cells of either line. In combination with GM-CSF and G-CSF, however, LIF significantly reduced the number of colonies formed in agar respectively by HL60 and U937 cells. GM-CSF alone greatly reduced the clonogenicity of U937 cells. Using sequential recloning, marked suppression of clonogenicity was observed using combinations of LIF with GM-CSF in HL60 cultures and with G-CSF in U937 cultures. These results suggest that human LIF may have some capacity to suppress human leukemia cells with loss of clonogenicity, at least in combination with G-CSF or GM-CSF.","['Maekawa, T', 'Metcalf, D']","['Maekawa T', 'Metcalf D']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria Australia.']",['eng'],"['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Apr;3(4):270-6.,,,,,,,,,

During the period after infection, two distinct phases were observed, based on growth properties, phenotype, and functional activity of the infected cells. Phase I HTLV-I infected cells (0 to about 150 days after infection) proliferated in an IL-2-dependent way, but without the requirement for repetitive antigenic stimulation. No differences in expression of the CD2, CD3, CD4, Tp103, and CD28 Ag between these cells and the parental cells could be demonstrated, with the exception of the expression of IL-R p55 and HLA-DR Ag, which were constitutively expressed on the phase I cells. The phase I HTLV-I-infected cells, as well as the parental 827 cells reacted with a mAb specific for an epitope on the variable part of the TCR beta-chain, indicating that the TCR was not altered after HTLV-I infection. Like the parental clone, the phase I cells proliferated in response to tetanus toxin, but the tetanus toxin-specific response of the phase I cells did not require the presence of APC. Results of experiments, in which the levels of intracellular Ca2+ were measured, indicated that HTLV-I cells can acquire the capability to process Ag and present that to themselves. Phase I HTLV-I-infected T cells had lost their cytotoxic activity which was likely to be due to an effect on the lytic machinery rather than on Ag recognition by the TCR, inasmuch as it was found that phase I HTLV-I-infected T cells did no longer contain N-alpha-benzyloxy-L-lysine thiobenzylester-serine esterase activity. Furthermore, it was found that phase I HTLV-I-infected T cells had a diminished capacity to form conjugates with target cells. From a period of about 200 days after HTLV-I infection, phase II cells emerged that proliferated strongly in the absence of IL-2 and that had lost all functional activity. These cells did not express the CD3/T cell receptor complex on their surface. Phase I as well as phase II HTLV-I-infected cells were targets for CTL raised in the autologous donor.","['Yssel, H', 'de Waal Malefyt, R', 'Duc Dodon, M D', 'Blanchard, D', 'Gazzolo, L', 'de Vries, J E', 'Spits, H']","['Yssel H', 'de Waal Malefyt R', 'Duc Dodon MD', 'Blanchard D', 'Gazzolo L', 'de Vries JE', 'Spits H']","['UNICET, Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Tetanus Toxin)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', '*Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/*classification/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*classification/immunology/metabolism', 'Tetanus Toxin/immunology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Apr 1;142(7):2279-89.,,,,,,,,,

The functional role of IL-1 in Ag-specific proliferation and IL-2 secretion was assessed by stimulating the T cell clones with FBL either in the presence or absence of macrophages (M phi), rIL-1, or rIL-2. Resting cloned HITc cells, purified from residual accessory cells, failed to proliferate in response to FBL alone, but proliferated in response to FBL plus M phi, rIL-1 or rIL-2. Stimulation with FBL alone in the absence of M phi or IL-1 was sufficient for induction of IL-2R expression, and rendered cells responsive to IL-2, but M phi or IL-1 were also required to induce production of IL-2. The activity of IL-1 was further examined by measuring the binding of [125I]rIL-1 alpha, which demonstrated that resting cloned HITc cells expressed IL-1R that increased in number after activation with Ag. This expression of IL-1R and requirement for IL-1 by CD8+ HITc was surprising because previous studies examining T cell populations after mitogen stimulation have not detected IL-1R on the CD8+ population. Therefore, the role of IL-1 in the activation of CD8+ CTL that do not secrete IL-2 after activation was assessed. By contrast to HITc, CD8+ CTL required exogenous IL-2 to proliferate in vitro and did not express IL-1R. These data demonstrate that the subset of CD8+ T cells responsible for IL-2 production express IL-1R and that triggering this receptor with IL-1 after Ag stimulation results in the production of IL-2 and subsequent proliferation.","['Klarnet, J P', 'Kern, D E', 'Dower, S K', 'Matis, L A', 'Cheever, M A', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Klarnet JP', 'Kern DE', 'Dower SK', 'Matis LA', 'Cheever MA', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA 01192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Apr 1;142(7):2187-91.,,,,,,,,,

While HLA-ABC (MHC Class I) molecules are virtually ubiquitous in tissue distribution, CD1 determinants by contrast are more restricted. We have assessed, by indirect immunoenzymeassay, the relative membrane densities of these molecules on malignant thymic and post-thymic T cells. It was found that the T cells of mature post-thymic proliferations expressed significantly more beta 2m-associated protein, predominantly HLA-ABC in nature, than thymic-ALL blasts. This parallels the situation found in normal peripheral T cells and thymocytes. In contrast to post-thymic T cells, thymic-ALL blasts showed considerable case to case variation with respect to non-HLA-associated beta 2m and, of particular interest, not all of this excess beta 2m could be accounted for by CD1a. We therefore conclude that other beta 2m-containing molecules may be expressed on thymic-ALL blasts and possibly also on post-thymic leukaemic T cells. In addition, it was found that T cells from CD4+ cases of post-thymic proliferations expressed more beta 2m-associated determinants than other T cells, whether of either normal or malignant origin, and that certain post-thymic malignancies express significantly increased levels of beta 2m-associated protein relative to normal peripheral T-cells.

This discrepancy is thought to be based on the following points: 1) fixation of human basophils is more difficult than that of the other leukocytes; 2) counterstaining with a certain basic dye causes misinterpretation of the enzyme reaction; 3) diaminobenzidine which has been most frequently used as hydrogen donor in the peroxidase reaction is so sensitive to non-enzymatic substances that substrate-minus experiments as well as inhibition experiments for peroxidase are absolutely necessary; and 4) basophils in the peripheral blood from healthy persons are originally peroxidase-negative. On the other hand, basophils in the peripheral blood from patients with myeloid leukemia are frequently peroxidase-positive, and yet, the peroxidase demonstrated in such basophils is not true myeloperoxidase since peroxidase from the above patients is resistant to heating, methanol and other chemicals known as inhibitors of myeloperoxidase.

We have applied a sensitive method capable of detecting subtle differences in charge-associated and noncharge-related cell surface properties between closely related cell populations to K-562 cells from different sources and having different histories. The method consists of isotopically labeling aliquots of each of two cell populations to be compared with 51Cr-chromate and mixing the labeled cells with an excess of unlabeled cells with which they are to be compared. The mixtures are subjected to countercurrent distribution in either a charge-sensitive or a noncharge-sensitive dextran-poly(ethylene glycol) aqueous two-phase system. The distribution curves are analyzed for total cells (in terms of electronic counts) and labeled cells (in terms of cpm). Alterations in relative specific activities through the distribution curves are indicative of differences in surface properties between such cell populations. Using this method we have found surface differences, both charge-associated and noncharge-related, between any two K-562 cell sublines examined. Interestingly, whereas we observed differences among K-562 sublines, we never witnessed a change in surface properties of the respective sublines. The differences among the sublines examined remained unaltered for more than 40 passages in our hands.

Their expression is linked to differential responsiveness of the cells to growth factors and inhibitors. We examined the expression of different MHC class II antigens in a panel of human myelomonocytic cell lines representing different stages of differentiation, by cytofluorographic analysis with monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and Northern blot analysis with specific cDNA probes. These analyses revealed discordant expression of different MHC class II antigens both in basal state and after gamma-IFN induction. Thus KG-1 myeloblast cells express all class II antigens (DR greater than DP greater than DQ) constitutively and their expression increased after gamma-IFN treatment. KG-1a, an immature blast variant of KG-1, does not express class II antigens, even after gamma-IFN treatment. THP-1, a monocytic cell line expresses DR but not DP or DQ under basal conditions. DP and DQ are, however, gamma-IFN inducible. The class II negative HL-60 promyelocytic cell line, expresses DR and DP but not DQ after gamma-IFN induction. In all the above cell lines, surface expression of class II antigens correlated with the levels of mRNA expression as determined with specific cDNA probes. In U-937, a monocytic cell line, no surface expression of class II MHC antigens was observed either with or without gamma-IFN, however, specific mRNA message was observed under basal conditions and was further increased with gamma-IFN, indicating a possible defect in assembly or transport of class II antigens.

Phenotypic, molecular, and cellular genetic data favor the presence of a myeloma stem cell early in hematopoietic development so that, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a far distance exists between the primordial malignant cell that was the target of malignant transformation and the dominant clinical phenotype. Traces of pre-B, myeloid, and T cells are coexpressed with the mature B-cell phenotype, an occurrence unknown in normal B-cell differentiation. Analogous to CML, disease progression is marked by disease dedifferentiation, occasionally with cessation of myeloma protein production and development instead of extramedullary lymphomalike features with high LDH or myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) syndromes. The prognostic importance of serum LDH levels even in newly diagnosed myeloma suggests the early presence of tumor cells with ""LDH phenotype,"" which, as a result of drug resistance and proliferative advantage, expand preferentially during disease progression. Further characterization of these cells may provide important clues about the ontogeny of multiple myeloma. Myeloma cells express many receptors for different biological signals that might be exploitable for therapy with immunotoxins or radioisotopes. Plasma cells and their precursors also produce a variety of cytokines, some of which have putatively autostimulatory functions (eg, IL-1, IL-5, IL-6) and/or are related to disease manifestations (eg, IL-1 and TNF-beta as OAF). The wealth of cellular expression by plasma cells provides clues for understanding the mechanisms of gene activation and the nature of abnormal growth and differentiation. The accuracy of prognostically relevant staging systems has been refined with the use of new quantitative parameters that reflect tumor mass (ie, serum B2M levels) and biology. Further studies of cellular and molecular biology (ie, CAL-LA, H-ras) may reveal those tumor cell features that define clinical entities, response to therapy, and long-term prognosis. The lack of a major advance in prognosis despite the use of more drugs and more intensive regimens justifies the continued use of standard melphalan-prednisone for patients with a highly favorable prognosis, for the very aged, and for those with a short life expectancy due to other major medical problems.

While functional heterogeneity of AML was clearly shown, we further demonstrated that optimal growth may be obtained with combinations of CSF. The most striking feature was that, in both suspension and semisolid cultures, IL-3 and G-CSF acted synergistically in supporting AML cell proliferation except in cases for which G-CSF was found to be an inhibitory factor. In the majority of cases, the proliferative effects of the IL-3 and GM-CSF combination were significantly higher than the most potent of either factor present alone in the cultures. Finally, preincubation with IL-3 greatly potentiated the responsiveness of AML cells to subsequent addition of either GM-CSF or G-CSF. These results indicate that AML cells respond to growth factor in the same way as normal hemopoietic cells and that stimulation by a second late-acting growth factor such as G-CSF is also required to yield optimal growth.","['Pebusque, M J', 'Fay, C', 'Lafage, M', 'Sempere, C', 'Saeland, S', 'Caux, C', 'Mannoni, P']","['Pebusque MJ', 'Fay C', 'Lafage M', 'Sempere C', 'Saeland S', 'Caux C', 'Mannoni P']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U.119, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Mar;3(3):200-5.,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the CD22 antigen has been identified in the cytoplasm of normal bone marrow-borne immature B lineage cells, while the CD3 antigen (epsilon chain) has been detected within normal immature thymic blasts. In the first part our study performed on 100 cases of known acute leukemias, the expression of such cytoplasmic molecules, referred to as cCD22 and cCD3, was analyzed together with their appearance in the leukemic cells' membrane (mCD22 and mCD3). The presence of cCD22 in B-lineage ALL and that of cCD3 in T-ALL has indeed fully confirmed the diagnosis reached by other markers, and mCD22 and mCD3 were expressed on only a few cases of B- and T-lineage ALL, also revealing a degree of developmental asynchrony within leukemic blasts. In the subsequent analysis both cCD22 and cCD3 have been included in a standard panel of diagnostic reagents applied on 500 consecutive cases of acute leukemia. Here the aim was to analyze both the diagnostic precision of individual markers and the heterogeneity of various leukemic types in terms of the expression of membrane and intracellular antigens and their cytochemical features (Sudan Black B and esterases). It has been found that cCD22 and cCD3 are exquisitely specific for B-precursor ALL (TdT+, CD19+) and T-ALL (TdT+, CD7+), respectively, while both markers are absent in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemia (AMML/AMoL). These observations contrast the findings which demonstrate that 31% of cases among nonlymphoid acute leukemia (including AML and AMML) express CD7 and/or TdT. The study of myeloid antigens detected by CD13, CD33, and CD14 is also informative and complementary, both in diagnosing and subdividing the AML and AMML/AMoL groups. The peculiar main observation of this study is that only with the combined use of these markers in a microplate assay for membrane antigens, followed by double staining for intracellular antigens such as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, cCD3, cCD22, c mu heavy chain, and T cell receptor beta, it is possible to safely establish the lineage affiliation and subgrouping of virtually all acute leukemias. Among these cases are those with aberrant combinations of markers, including 14% of B-lineage ALL (cCD22+,CD19+,TdT+) and a single case T-ALL (cCD3+,CD7+,TdT+), which exhibit CD13 and/or CD33 antigens, cases with mixtures of ALL and AML blasts, and 1.2% of acute leukemias which lack lineage affiliation and can be regarded as acute undifferentiated leukemia.","['Janossy, G', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Campana, D']","['Janossy G', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Campana D']","['Department of Immunology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification', 'CD3 Complex', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cytoplasm/*immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Humans', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Mar;3(3):170-81.,,,,,,,,,

IT were radiolabeled with iodine-125 and then studied for their subcellular compartmentalization in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia T cell line, CEM. Ricin A chain IT was not as toxic to CEM cells as Rc-IT in protein synthesis inhibition assays. This difference was not attributed to differential binding or modulation of the CD5 determinant from the cell surface as measured by FACS analysis. However, we found a relationship between the toxicity of anti-CD5-Rc and anti-CD5-RTA and their ability to traffic to CEM lysosomes. Kinetic analysis of the transfer of radioimmunotoxin to the lysosomes showed that anti-CD5-Rc was trafficked significantly more slowly than anti-CD5-RTA, perhaps due to an extended period of time in the Golgi compartment. The possibility of a Golgi interaction was tested by adding monensin, a carboxylic ionophore that interrupts trafficking through the Golgi, to cells treated with anti-CD5-RTA. The addition of monensin caused anti-CD5-RTA to traffic in a manner identical to anti-CD5-Rc. We conclude that 1) B chain slows trafficking of anti-CD5-Rc to the lysosomes; 2) the rate-limiting step in the toxicity difference between anti-CD5-Rc and anti-CD5-RTA is the rate of transfer to the lysosomes; and 3) trafficking through the Golgi may be important for anti-CD5-IT toxicity.","['Manske, J M', 'Buchsbaum, D J', 'Vallera, D A']","['Manske JM', 'Buchsbaum DJ', 'Vallera DA']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-43368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*toxicity', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', '*Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Ricin/*physiology/toxicity']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Mar 1;142(5):1755-66.,,,,,,,,,

Based on a clonogenic assay, the IC50S of these MTX-resistant clones were 10 to 40 microM MTX, indicating 2,000 to 5,000-fold resistance as compared to that of the parent cell line. The doubling times of these MTX-resistant K562 cell lines are longer (27-60 hr) than that of the parent K562 cell line (24 hr). One-hour MTX accumulation in the resistant cells cells was 70-80% of that in parent cells. To investigate the formation of MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-PGs), resistant cells were incubated with 3H-MTX (1 or 10 microM) for 24 hr in the presence of thymidine and deoxyinosine to prevent cytotoxicity. MTX (-Glu1) and the polyglutamate metabolites (MTX-Glu2, -Glu3, -Glu4 and -Glu5) were analyzed by a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. After a 24-hr incubation with 10 microM MTX, the total concentration of intracellular MTX reached 39 to 89 nmol/g protein, only 20 to 40% of the MTX level of the parent K562 cells. The HPLC analysis revealed that less than 2% of intracellular MTX was in the form of high-molecular MTX-PGs (MTX-Glu3, -Glu4 and -Glu5) in the five MTX-resistant K562 cell lines, while in the parent cells MTX-Glu3-5 comprised 46% of the total intracellular MTX.

Each course consisted of 8 bi-weekly infusions of T101-RTA (7 or 14 mg/m2). The immunotoxin was well tolerated in all cases with no major toxicities. Though saturation of circulating leukemic cell-associated target antigen was demonstrated by FACS analysis in all patients, no intact immunotoxin was detected in bone-marrow or lymph-node aspirates. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed rapid clearance of T101-RTA, with a half-life of 43 min. None of the patients developed detectable titers of antibody against either T101 murine antibody or ricin A chain. Clinical response was limited to a rapid and transient fall in WBC count lasting less than 24 hr, most likely secondary to the antibody portion of the conjugate. In vitro, fresh B-CLL cells were resistant to T101-RTA at concentrations up to 10(-8)M, while fresh malignant T-cells with a 10-fold increase in expression of CD5 antigen were sensitive. In the presence of the enhancing agent human serum albumin-monensin, fresh B-CLL cells were sensitive to T101-RTA, with an ID50 more than 2 logs below the maximal concentration of immunotoxin achieved in vivo.

The nuclear enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a marker of early lymphoid differentiation, was detected by immunofluorescence on 0.031% of mononuclear cells in cytocentrifuge preparations, representing an approximate 10-fold increase in frequency over expression in childhood or adult blood. These circulating TdT+ cells were shown in double labelling experiments to predominantly express markers of B cell differentiation (CD-24, CD-10, MHC Class 2), although occasional cells co-expressing the T lineage marker CD-2 were also seen. These findings are consistent with the circulation of B cell precursors in neonatal blood. The nature of the CD-1+ cells is unclear, although the absence of CD-1+ TdT+ double labelled cells mitigates against the possible presence of immature thymus-processed lymphocytes in these samples.","['Bradstock, K F', 'Kerr, A', 'Grimsley, P', 'Kirk, J', 'Luxford, C']","['Bradstock KF', 'Kerr A', 'Grimsley P', 'Kirk J', 'Luxford C']","['Haematology Department, Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD1', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/classification/cytology/enzymology/*immunology', 'Phenotype']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1988.50 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1988 Oct-Dec;66 ( Pt 5-6):387-94. doi: 10.1038/icb.1988.50.,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examined whether NAP activity inducible with G-CSF could be modulated by other factors that are present in vivo or those that are known to induce differentiation of hemopoietic cells. Purified natural and recombinant G-CSF (nG-CSF and rG-CSF) induced NAP in PMGs from both normal individuals and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Interferons (IFNs) suppressed expression of NAP by G-CSF. IFN-gamma was a potent inhibitor of G-CSF stimulation: IFN-gamma at 100 U/ml inhibited by greater than 90% the induction of NAP by G-CSF. In contrast, retinol (10(-6) M, a nearly physiological concentration) or all-trans-retinoic acid (10(-6) M) significantly enhanced NAP activity in vitro. Furthermore, the simultaneous addition of 10(-6) M retinol partially reversed the inhibitory action of IFN-gamma on the NAP induction by G-CSF.

On normal cells CSF-1 receptors were restricted in their expression to cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. CSF-1 receptors were detected on leukemic blasts from 15 (30%) of 50 children with acute myeloid leukemia, compared with four (15%) of 26 adults. By contrast, detectable CSF-1 receptors were uniformly absent on blasts from 19 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CSF-1 receptors on normal monocytes and myeloid leukemia cells could be induced to downmodulate by incubation with either human recombinant CSF-1 or phorbol esters, confirming that the receptors had functional ligand-binding sites and responded to transmodulation by inducers of protein kinase C. The numbers of receptors per cell and the percentage of positive cases were highest for leukemic blasts with cytochemical and morphological features of monocytes. However, CSF-1 receptors were also detected on a subset of leukemic blast cells with features of granulocytic differentiation (FAB subtypes M1 through M3). Southern blotting analyses of DNA from 47 cases of acute myeloid leukemia demonstrated no rearrangements within the 32 kb of genomic sequences that contain CSF-1 receptor coding exons or in the 50 kb upstream of the first coding exon. Analysis of the upstream region of the c-fms locus revealed that sequences representing the terminal 112 untranslated nucleotides of c-fms mRNA map 26 kb 5' to the first coding exon, suggesting that at least one c-fms promoter is separated from the receptor coding sequences by a very long intron. Whereas expression of the CSF-1 receptor in myeloid leukemic blasts is not restricted to cells with monocytic characteristics, the apparently aberrant pattern of receptor synthesis in a subset of cases with granulocytic features appears not to be due to chromosomal rearrangements within 50 kb upstream of sequences encoding the receptor.","['Ashmun, R A', 'Look, A T', 'Roberts, W M', 'Roussel, M F', 'Seremetis, S', 'Ohtsuka, M', 'Sherr, C J']","['Ashmun RA', 'Look AT', 'Roberts WM', 'Roussel MF', 'Seremetis S', 'Ohtsuka M', 'Sherr CJ']","[""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35-CA47064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epitopes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Phagocytes/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Restriction Mapping']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76269-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb 15;73(3):827-37.,,,,,,,,,

A clonogenic assay demonstrated that all immunotoxins could eliminate more than two logs of clonogenic malignant B cells with a two-hour incubation at concentrations not toxic to cells not bearing target antigens. The immunotoxin activity was evaluated by DNA synthesis inhibition in fresh B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL) stimulated to proliferate by incubation with an antibody specific for the receptor of C3b complement component (CR1) plus B cell growth factor. B-CLL cell DNA synthesis was actively inhibited by treatment at low immunotoxin concentration without need of potentiators. Immunotoxins exerted their effect also in whole blood of CLL patients under conditions achievable in vivo. We conclude that B cell-restricted immunotoxins HD37-SAP, HD39-SAP, and HD6-SAP are good candidates for in vivo therapy of B-cell malignancies.","['Bregni, M', 'Siena, S', 'Formosa, A', 'Lappi, D A', 'Martineau, D', 'Malavasi, F', 'Dorken, B', 'Bonadonna, G', 'Gianni, A M']","['Bregni M', 'Siena S', 'Formosa A', 'Lappi DA', 'Martineau D', 'Malavasi F', 'Dorken B', 'Bonadonna G', 'Gianni AM']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*toxicity', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Plant Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76258-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb 15;73(3):753-62.,,,,,,,,,

PADGEM protein is expressed on the surface of activated platelets but not on the surface of resting platelets. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells contain platelet alpha granule-like organelles, alpha granule proteins, and express platelet membrane glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb. We demonstrate that HEL cells express a protein that has a molecular weight identical to that of PADGEM and binds to anti-PADGEM antibodies. The exposure of HEL cells in culture to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) increased the number of cells expressing PADGEM. Fluorescence activated flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an increase in mean surface expression of PADGEM in DMSO-exposed cells compared to noninduced cells. Total cell content of PADGEM was increased 5.3-fold after DMSO exposure, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Direct binding experiments with the monoclonal anti-PADGEM antibody KC4 demonstrated specific, saturable, and time-dependent interaction of KC4 with HEL cells. A Kd of 7 nM was estimated. There were 14,000 surface binding sites per cell in noninduced cells and 24,000 surface binding sites per cell in DMSO-induced HEL cells. Surface expression of PADGEM protein on HEL cells was not increased with platelet agonists, including thrombin, epinephrine, ADP, nor cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, tissue necrosis factor. The presence of PADGEM protein in HEL cells should facilitate the elucidation of the function of PADGEM protein.","['Yeo, E', 'Furie, B C', 'Furie, B']","['Yeo E', 'Furie BC', 'Furie B']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, New England Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111.']",['eng'],['HL21543/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'P-Selectin', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76253-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb 15;73(3):722-8.,,,,,,,,,

Previously we reported the use of anti-idiotype antibodies in the therapy of patients with B-cell malignancies. Because synergy was demonstrated with the addition of alpha interferon to anti-idiotype antibodies in a murine lymphoma model, we performed a clinical trial combining these two agents. Here we provide an update of the original trial of anti-idiotype antibodies alone and report the outcome of the new combination trial. In 16 treatment courses of anti-idiotype antibodies alone there were seven partial responses and one complete response. In 12 courses of combination anti-idiotype antibody and alpha interferon there were two complete responses and seven partial responses. Substantial tumor regressions occurred with minimal toxicity in both trials even in patients refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Tumor specimens obtained at the time of disease progression often contained a preponderance of idiotype-negative lymphoma cells, suggesting that anti-idiotype antibody treatment exerted a strong antitumor effect against antigen-positive cells. Anti-idiotype antibodies have reproducible objective antitumor activity in B-cell lymphoma. The addition of alpha interferon may improve the initial rate of response to this treatment. Strategies that deal effectively with idiotype-negative lymphoma cells should improve the extent and duration of these responses.","['Brown, S L', 'Miller, R A', 'Horning, S J', 'Czerwinski, D', 'Hart, S M', 'McElderry, R', 'Basham, T', 'Warnke, R A', 'Merigan, T C', 'Levy, R']","['Brown SL', 'Miller RA', 'Horning SJ', 'Czerwinski D', 'Hart SM', 'McElderry R', 'Basham T', 'Warnke RA', 'Merigan TC', 'Levy R']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA.']",['eng'],"['CA 33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Interferons', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76241-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Feb 15;73(3):651-61.,,,,,,,,,

The antileukaemic activity was evaluated by means of a survival study. For aza-dC a dose-response relationship was demonstrated for doses up to 50 mg kg-1 (3 times q 12 h); a higher dose resulted in only a slight increase in median survival time (MST). For ara-C a weak dose-response relationship was observed. At the maximum dose of aza-dC and ara-C tested, aza-dC induced a 10-day longer survival time than ara-C, which means 2 logs more of leukaemic cell kill for aza-dC. By means of flow cytometric analysis and a 3HTdR uptake study it was shown that aza-dC does not influence the cell cycle kinetics in the first 24 h after exposure, in contrast to ara-C which caused the characteristic G1/S blockage and synchronization. The influence of aza-dC and ara-C on normal haematopoiesis was evaluated with the CFU-S assay. The dose-response curve for CFU-S did not show a significant difference in stem cell cytotoxicity between aza-dC and ara-C. In the BNML model aza-dC is a much more effective antileukaemic agent than ara-C, while the toxic effect on normal haematopoiesis is comparable to that of ara-C.","['Richel, D J', 'Colly, L P', 'Lurvink, E', 'Willemze, R']","['Richel DJ', 'Colly LP', 'Lurvink E', 'Willemze R']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Time Factors']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1988.298 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1988 Dec;58(6):730-3. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1988.298.,,,,,,PMC2246862,,,

Molecular genetic analysis of the T-cell receptor beta-chain and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were also applied to cases of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia (AILD)-like lymphoma and so-called Lennert's lymphoma. Twenty non-ATL lymphomas expressed a helper/inducer phenotype, whereas only one extranodal case expressed a suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype. Three cases had a CD4-CD8- phenotype, and two cases a CD4+CD8+phenotype. No specific relationship between morphologic characteristics (LSG classification) and phenotype was found among non-ATL lymphomas. Six of eight AILD-like lymphomas had a helper/inducer phenotype. Monoclonality of neoplastic T-cells was demonstrated in six of the seven cases of AILD-like lymphoma by molecular genetic analysis. Two cases of Lennert's lymphoma also showed a helper/inducer phenotype and rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene. Serologically defined ATL cases had a helper/inducer phenotype except in one case that expressed both CD4 and CD8. None of the ATL cases had the CD7 antigen in this study using WT 1 as a CD7 antibody, which is in contrast with the non-ATL lymphomas in which 13 of 25 cases expressed CD7. CD25, strongly detectable in all ATL cases, was negative or weakly expressed in non-ATL lymphomas.

Fusion of the HPRT- murine cell line BW5147 with human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or normal human blood cells resulted in a panel of human-murine T-cell hybrids. For this study, we used four hybrids containing all or several human chromosomes, which all expressed the CD4 antigen, as assessed by different anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., OKT4A, Leu-3a, and MT151) and, in addition, a variable number of other human T-cell antigens. For infection, HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells, pretreated with mitomycin C, and cell-free concentrated supernatants from these cells were used. In cells of inoculated cultures of the CD4+ T-cell hybrids, no viral antigen could be demonstrated. Culture supernatants of inoculated hybrids, except for an initial rise due to the virus inoculum, never showed reverse transcriptase activity above background. Cocultivation of these cell cultures with H9 cells did not result in detectable virus replication. Cocultivation of CD4-expressing hybrid cells with HIV-infected cells did not result in syncytium formation.

Phase I clinical trials disclosed significant antitumor activity in lymphoid malignancies. Fludarabine has been used in the treatment of CLL since March, 1985, at a dose of 25-30 mg/m2/day x 5 days each 3-4 weeks by short intravenous infusion. Sixty-eight previously treated patients with CLL are evaluable for response. The median age was 60 years, 50 were male the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2, and the median time from initial chemotherapy to fludarabine was 45 months. Forty-three (63%) were Rai stages 3 and 4, 31 (46%) were Binet Stage C. Twenty patients (29%) obtained a complete remission (CR), defined as peripheral lymphocytes less than 4,000/microliters, no clinical evidence of disease, less than 30% of lymphocytes in the bone marrow (with no residual nodules), or a nodular partial remission, NPR (CR except for residual lymphoid nodules), and 19 (28%) a partial remission (less than 50% reduction in tumor in nodes, liver, spleen and bone marrow and greater than 1 log reduction in the lymphocyte count). The complete remission rate for the various involved sites were blood (69%), liver (52%), spleen (55%), and nodes (48%). The bone marrow was the least responsive site with 16% CR and 44% PR.

Second, nucleotides which are present as 5' non-translated sequence in the p61c-yes mRNA, are translated in the p90gag/v-yes mRNA. Third, there are fourteen dispersed nucleotide differences in Y73 v-yes which result in six amino differences between the body of p90gag/v-yes and p61c-yes.

Sixteen clones were isolated, each containing unrearranged c-myc sequences and expressing high levels of antisense transcripts. All antisense clones examined contained reduced amounts of cytoplasmic endogenous c-myc transcripts. The kinetics of reaccumulation of endogenous c-myc mRNA during a 24-h exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were also retarded and the ultimate transcript levels attained were less than in control cells. Antisense clones grew as well as control F-MEL cells in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum but at only a half and a quarter of the control rates in media containing 5 and 2% serum, respectively. Antisense clones differentiated faster and to a greater degree than control cells following DMSO exposure. myc antisense transcript expression was increased by growing cells in methotrexate, which resulted in an enhanced response to DMSO. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of cellular DNA content indicated that a greater fraction of antisense nuclei contained a G0/G1 2n DNA content following a 24-h exposure to DMSO. When density-arrested antisense clones were diluted into fresh medium to allow reentry into the cell cycle, they incorporated less [3H]thymidine than control cells. FACS analysis showed that this was because only a portion of the cell population was entering S phase. Whereas control cells did not increase in size following release from density arrested antisense cells contained a subpopulation which were initially smaller and which eventually attained the same size as control cells. Quiescent antisense cells thus comprise two populations, each arrested at a different point in G1. Dilutional replating allowed both populations to reenter the cell cycle. We propose a model which postulates that certain minimal myc levels are necessary for cells to traverse G1. Those with insufficient levels, due, for example, to antisense inhibition, are unable to completely traverse G1 during density arrest and synchronize at an earlier point than do control cells. This earlier point may be along the differentiation pathway and may account for the greater responsiveness of antisense cells to DMSO induction. This model postulates that F-MEL cells overexpressing myc fail to differentiate because myc levels are never sufficiently low enough to allow cells to enter the differentiation pathway.","['Prochownik, E V', 'Kukowska, J', 'Rodgers, C']","['Prochownik EV', 'Kukowska J', 'Rodgers C']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],['HL 33741/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/*genetics', 'RNA, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.9.3683-3695.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Sep;8(9):3683-95. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.9.3683-3695.1988.,,,,,,PMC365424,,,

Further analysis demonstrated that the majority of the lysis against autologous and allogeneic targets was HLA-DR-restricted and mediated by CD4+ CTL. However, CD8+ CTL also contributed to the lysis of autologous targets as well as allogeneic targets having a common HLA-A and/or -B determinant. The HLA-restricted cytotoxicity was virus-specific as HSV-infected, but not CMV-infected, cells were lysed. CTL-mediated lysis of HSV-infected monocytes and macrophages may be of significance in the anti-viral and immunoregulatory host response.","['Torpey, D J 3rd', 'Lindsley, M D', 'Rinaldo, C R Jr']","['Torpey DJ 3rd', 'Lindsley MD', 'Rinaldo CR Jr']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15261.']",['eng'],['AI-16212/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Herpes Simplex/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages/*immunology/microbiology', 'Monocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*classification/immunology']",1989/02/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Feb 15;142(4):1325-32.,,,,,,,,,

By studying the number and antigenic specificity of B cells activated in the course of this disease, we found that a series of reproducible changes in the humoral immune system were induced by retroviral infection. The rate of B cell proliferation and the proportion of B cells activated to secrete Ig increased by nearly 10-fold at 4 wk post inoculation. B cells producing antibodies reactive with a panel of three conventional Ag and five autoantigens were stimulated simultaneously and proportionally to secrete, demonstrating that such activation was polyclonal in nature. At 12 wk post infection, the number of Ig-secreting B cells continued to rise and significant hypergammaglobulinemia developed. At 16 wk post infection, immunostimulation gave way to immunosuppression, as evidenced by a slight decline in the number of Ig-secreting lymphocytes and a sharp reduction in the concentration of serum antibody. At this time, the B cell repertoires of infected mice diverged markedly from those of uninfected animals. These changes are comparable to those found in some patients infected with HIV, and provide a useful model to study the association between retroviral infection and regulatory abnormalities of the humoral immune system.","['Klinman, D M', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Klinman DM', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Infectious Diseases Branch, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['N01 AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Epitopes', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Feb 15;142(4):1144-9.,,,,,,,,,

The present studies were carried out to further characterize the functional role of the CD16 Ag and the mechanisms whereby cytotoxicity is activated by using human NK clones. In phenotypic studies Fc gamma RIII was found to be expressed heterogeneously on various human cloned NK cells. Expression on CD3- and CD3+ clones varied with the donor and mAb used for detection. Functional data demonstrated that cytotoxicity against NK-resistant target cells can be induced in CD3-CD16+ NK clones and CD3+CD16+ clones with NK activity when various CD16 mAb were used. CD16 antibodies but not reactive isotype control antibodies induced cytotoxicity. In contrast to complete CD16 antibodies F(ab')2 fragments were not able to activate the cytotoxic mechanism. Both an antibody against FcR on the target cell (Fc gamma RII) and a CD11a antibody blocked induction of cytotoxicity. These results suggest that three steps are critical for activation of CD16+ cells via Fc gamma RIII: 1) specific binding of CD16 antibodies to Fc gamma RIII on effector cells irrespective of the epitope recognized; 2) cross-linking of effector cell CD16 Ag through binding of the Fc site of CD16 antibodies via corresponding FcR on the target cell membrane; and 3) interaction of CD11a/18 molecules with the target cell membrane.,"['Werfel, T', 'Uciechowski, P', 'Tetteroo, P A', 'Kurrle, R', 'Deicher, H', 'Schmidt, R E']","['Werfel T', 'Uciechowski P', 'Tetteroo PA', 'Kurrle R', 'Deicher H', 'Schmidt RE']","['Abteillung Immunologie und Transfusionsmedizin, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, FRG.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis/immunology/*physiology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Clone Cells/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG']",1989/02/15 00:00,1989/02/15 00:01,['1989/02/15 00:00'],"['1989/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Feb 15;142(4):1102-6.,,,,,,,,,

The curves, representing increase in binding of AO as a function of rise in temperature, indicate that the transitions are cooperative. The transitions are sensitive to ionic strength and occur at lower temperatures when cells are suspended in media of increasing ionic strength. Extraction of histones raises accessibility of DNA to intercalators at room temperature, and heating has little effect on additional binding. The results are interpreted as indicating thermal destruction of nucleosomal structure in nuclear chromatin; dissociation of DNA from core histones results in its increasing ability to intercalate AO, most likely due to increased topological freedom to undergo unwinding and elongation following binding of the intercalator. Preincubation of cells with n-butyrate, known to induce histone hyperacetylation, lowers the heat stability of nucleosomes by about 5 degrees C. On the other hand, no differences are observed between chromatin of mitotic vs interphase cells tested over a wide range of ionic strengths (0.1-0.7 N NaCl).

Cloned granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was recently shown to enhance the growth and differentiation of normal granulocyte progenitor cells in vitro. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of recombinant human G-CSF in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and one patient with smoldering acute myelogenous leukemia following the occurrence of a myelodysplastic syndrome received recombinant human G-CSF by intravenous infusion for six days. Patients received different dosage levels (50 to 1,600 micrograms/m2). RESULTS: A response was seen in all patients, with an increase in both immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and mature granulocytes in the peripheral blood. The dose levels that could stimulate granulocytopoiesis differed among patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, at least in some cases of myelodysplastic syndromes, granulocytopenia can be improved by G-CSF, although it still remains to be determined whether the increase in the number of granulocytes is due to the differentiation and maturation of the myelodysplastic clone or restoration of a residual normal clone.","['Kobayashi, Y', 'Okabe, T', 'Ozawa, K', 'Chiba, S', 'Hino, M', 'Miyazono, K', 'Urabe, A', 'Takaku, F']","['Kobayashi Y', 'Okabe T', 'Ozawa K', 'Chiba S', 'Hino M', 'Miyazono K', 'Urabe A', 'Takaku F']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory/therapy', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/therapy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', '*Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/*therapy']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(89)90265-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(89)90265-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1989 Feb;86(2):178-82. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90265-9.,,,,,,,,,

One class of high affinity binding sites was detected with a Kd (+/- S.D.) of 0.43 +/- 0.09 nM and a mean density/cell of 1200 +/- 311. The cell-associated 125I-epo was displaced by nonlabeled epo but not by other hormones or factors. The 125I-epo binding to Red 5-1.5 cells was maximal within 3 h at 15 degrees C and 1 h at 37 degrees C and proportional to cell number. The addition of epo increased [3H] uridine incorporation into RNA by 6 h and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 60 h followed by 59Fe incorporation into protein, cell proliferation, and formation of hemoglobin-containing colonies. The incorporation of 59Fe into protein demonstrated a linear dose response (from 0.002 to 1.5 units of epo/ml) beginning 60 h after addition of the hormone to the cultures, and there was a dose-dependent increase (from 0.1 to 1.0 unit of epo/ml) in the formation of hemoglobin-containing colonies. We concluded that the binding of 125I-epo to Red 5-1.5 suggests the presence of specific epo receptors. The sequence of the epo-induced proliferation and differentiation events is similar to primary erythroid cultures but requires longer epo exposure. Receptor occupancy correlates with the induced biological response.","['Weiss, T L', 'Barker, M E', 'Selleck, S E', 'Wintroub, B U']","['Weiss TL', 'Barker ME', 'Selleck SE', 'Wintroub BU']","['Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco 94121.']",['eng'],"['AM26743/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM31901/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1989/01/25 00:00,1989/01/25 00:01,['1989/01/25 00:00'],"['1989/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)94259-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jan 25;264(3):1804-10.,,,,,,,,,

Such increases were found neither with rhG-CSF samples pretreated with rabbit anti-rhG-CSF serum nor with other human colony-stimulating factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hM-CSF). Based on these findings, sera from normal persons and patients with severe infections or various hematological disorders were tested after dialysis using this system in order to determine whether G-CSF levels in sera can be estimated or not. In ten normal persons, five patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML M1, M2, and M3), five with myelodysplastic syndrome, and four with chronic myelogenous leukemia, no increases in [3H]thymidine uptake were found within the dose range of 0.4 microliters to 50 microliters. In contrast, linear dose responses parallel to a G-CSF standard curve were observed in one patient with a severe bacterial infection, four with aplastic anemia, two with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMoL) (M4), and two with idiopathic neutropenia tested. From the standard curve, the probable levels of G-CSF were calculated as follows: approximately 200 pg/ml with infection, 130-220 pg/ml with aplastic anemia, 150 and 200 pg/ml with AMMoL, and 1120 and 1200 pg/ml with idiopathic neutropenia. The activities of sera were reduced by the anti-rhG-CSF serum pretreatment in the same way as documented in the case of rhG-CSF. Furthermore, the level in a patient with a severe infection became undetectable soon after elimination of the infection and blood neutrophil counts had returned to normal. These findings indicate that the microbioassay system will be useful for measuring circulating G-CSF levels which would fluctuate in accord with requirements for stimulating neutrophil production or with abnormal production of hG-CSF.","['Shirafuji, N', 'Asano, S', 'Matsuda, S', 'Watari, K', 'Takaku, F', 'Nagata, S']","['Shirafuji N', 'Asano S', 'Matsuda S', 'Watari K', 'Takaku F', 'Nagata S']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Infections/*blood/metabolism', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*blood/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*blood/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/blood', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Feb;17(2):116-9.,,,,,,,,,

Modulation of transcriptional elongation by attenuation within exon 1 of the myc gene is thought to play an important role in determining levels of myc RNA in both normal and tumor cells. We show that the first exon of mouse myc contains specific DNA sequences that may mediate transcriptional attenuation. A 180-nucleotide DNA fragment derived from the 3' end of exon 1 reduced transcriptional elongation by polymerase II when placed within an intron of the human alpha 1-globin gene and assayed by transfection into HeLa cells. A 36-nucleotide sequence that resembles a variety of transcriptional termination signals was located within this myc fragment but was by itself insufficient to cause attenuation when placed within the alpha-globin gene.

In addition, 13/14 (93%) of the deceased patients experienced at least one appropriate AICD discharge at a mean of 4.5 months post implantation. Recorded ECGs at the time of death revealed that most of the sudden deaths were due to electromechanical dissociation and not to AICD-treatable arrhythmias.

To assess the effects of G-CSF in chemotherapy induced cytopenias, we administered G-CSF to monkeys that had been treated with cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/dx2), or repeated cycles of busulfan (4, 6 or 10 mg/kg/dx3).

This results in a cellular picture very similar to human B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here we report a molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin gene rearrangements of the Ly-1 B cell populations in (NZB x NZW)F1 females. We find that (i) the number of clones found in the peritoneum (a major tissue source of Ly-1 B cells) decreases with age till mono- or biclonality is common by approximately 6 months, (ii) many clones from different mice show the same size rearrangements at both the Ig heavy and light chain loci and (iii) the IgH rearrangements found in a clone isolated from the spleen of one mouse are a subset of those found in the peritoneum of the same mouse, implying migration occurs from the peritoneum to the spleen. Molecular cloning and sequencing of the IgH rearrangements from the peritoneal clones of one B/W mouse revealed that all productive rearrangements used the identical unmutated VH and D elements joined to different JHS. Indeed, two VDJH4 rearrangements were recovered which were identical but for six junctional (N region) nucleotides. The conservation of VH and D segment usage in the rearrangements of these Ly-1 B cell clones could indicate some strong selective pressure for clonal expansion (for example antigen selection) operates via the immunoglobulin molecules of these cells. Southern analyses of other (NZB x NZW)F1 mice with this cloned VH and the usage of the same or similar VH genes among a number of Ly-1 B origin tumors in other mouse strains indicate the generality of this repetitive VH gene usage in individual mice.","['Tarlinton, D', 'Stall, A M', 'Herzenberg, L A']","['Tarlinton D', 'Stall AM', 'Herzenberg LA']","['Department of Genetics, Stanford University, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['AI-07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Clone Cells', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peritoneum/cytology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen/cytology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1988 Dec 1;7(12):3705-10.,,,,,,PMC454944,,,

Studies with in vivo passaged interferon-sensitive and interferon-resistant cell clones.,425-34,"Experiments were designed to test the presence of antitumor natural resistance (NR) in DBA/2 mice against highly oncogenic in vivo passaged histocompatible Friend leukemia cells (FLC-V). NR was measured in vivo as rapid clearance of radiolabeled cells from different organs or as growth inhibition in lethally irradiated mice. Interferon-sensitive (745) or interferon-resistant (3C18) lines were used. Organ clearance studies showed that young recipients eliminate cells more rapidly than old mice. Moreover, depressive (e.g., cyclophosphamide or carrageenen) or enhancing (e.g., poly (I:C) or Friend leukemia virus infection) agents of NR function modulate accordingly leukemia cell clearance. Similar results were obtained testing tumor growth in lethally irradiated hosts, although modulating agents were substantially less effective in this system. Both FLC-745-V and FLC-3C18-V lines were equally susceptible to NR. Therefore, these data provide further support to the hypothesis that exogenous IFN capable of suppressing the growth of both lines could act via enhancement of the NR function.","['Iorio, A M', 'Neri, M', 'Zei, T', 'Romeo, G', 'Rossi, G B', 'Bonmassar, E']","['Iorio AM', 'Neri M', 'Zei T', 'Romeo G', 'Rossi GB', 'Bonmassar E']","['Department of Hygiene, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrageenan/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*growth & development', 'Gamma Rays', 'Idoxuridine/pharmacokinetics', '*Immunity, Innate/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Virus Replication']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(89)90390-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(89)90390-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1989 Feb;118(2):425-34. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(89)90390-0.,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effect of IFN on tumor cell sensitivity to LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the human K562 leukemia and HHMS melanoma with IFN-gamma and the Daudi lymphoma with IFN-alpha caused a significant reduction in sensitivity to lysis by human LAK cells generated in vitro in the presence of human recombinant IL-2 (100 U/ml). The LAK activity was mediated by cells expressing NK cell markers (CD16,NKH1) as well as by cells with T cell markers (CD3, CD5). IFN-treated K562 cells were protected from lysis mediated by all these populations. Supernatants from LAK cultures containing IFN-gamma were able to induce NK and LAK resistance when used to pretreat K562 overnight. Antibodies to IFN-gamma but not to IFN-alpha were able to neutralize this activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the production of IFN-gamma by LAK cells may be of importance in induction of tumor cell resistance to LAK cell-mediated lysis.","['Gronberg, A', 'Ferm, M', 'Tsai, L', 'Kiessling, R']","['Gronberg A', 'Ferm M', 'Tsai L', 'Kiessling R']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['CA 44882-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification/drug effects/*immunology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(89)90353-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(89)90353-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1989 Jan;118(1):10-21. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(89)90353-5.,,,,,,,,,

However, a 24-h treatment was lethal to 99% of the cells, as determined by colony formation. To investigate the mechanism for this delayed cytotoxicity, the metabolism of AzUrd was studied. Cells incubated with AzUrd contained a new 254 nm-absorbing component, not found in control cells. It appeared to be 6-azauridine-5'-triphosphate, since it was the only peak in the triphosphate region of the chromatogram which contained 3H after incubation of cells with [3H]AzUrd. Incorporation of [3H]AzUrd into the acid-insoluble fraction (nucleic acids) was also detected. A role for this incorporation in the mechanism of AzUrd cytotoxicity was strongly suggested by the observation that cordycepin (0.01 mM) partially protected cells from the lethality of AzUrd, presumably by preventing its incorporation into RNA. The previously known inhibition of pyrimidine de novo synthesis by AzUrd was confirmed by a decrease in the intracellular contents of UTP and CTP in AzUrd-treated cells. Therefore, we propose that the inhibition of pyrimidine de novo synthesis and the incorporation into nucleic acid(s) may act in concert to produce the cytotoxic effects of AzUrd.","['Wotring, L L', 'Townsend, L B']","['Wotring LL', 'Townsend LB']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-1065.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', ""6198-30-7 (6-azauridine 5'-triphosphate)"", '7BVB29RCPR (Azauridine)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azauridine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Uracil Nucleotides/*analysis', 'Uridine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/*analysis']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jan 15;49(2):289-94.,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, it was found that the G-CSF level rose during the neutropenic phase of cyclic neutropenia and after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in three patients with leukemia; also high G-CSF levels were positively correlated to blood neutrophil counts in some cases of infectious disorders and lung cancer.

Conjugates of these derivatives with macromolecules were examined for their binding to cells of the rat basophilic leukemia line RBL-2H3, which is widely employed as a model for immunologically induced mast cell degranulation. Only those drug-protein conjugates in which the cromolyn analogue with an amino group at the propane 2-carbon instead of the hydroxyl was linked to the carrier by glutaraldehyde were found to exhibit specific and saturable binding to these cells. Analysis of the binding data for these conjugates yielded an apparent binding constant of 3.8 +/- 0.2 X 10(8) M-1 and an apparent number of binding sites for the probe of 4000-8000 per cell. The conjugates found to bind specifically to the cells were also immobilized on agarose matrices and employed in an affinity-based isolation of the membrane component responsible for the observed binding. A single labeled polypeptide was eluted from these columns, onto which either whole cell lysates or solubilized purified plasma membranes of surface-radioiodinated RBL-2H3 cells had been adsorbed. This membrane protein appears on autoradiograms of nonreducing SDS-PAGE as a single broad band of approximately 110,000 daltons (Da) apparent molecular mass. On autoradiograms of reducing gels, the only band detected has an apparent mass of approximately 50,000 Da and appears narrower. Elution of the columns with the drug and disulfide-reducing agents or with the latter alone resulted in significantly higher yields of the 50-kDa polypeptide. Both the intact and reduced proteins bind strongly to immobilized concanavalin A and less so to immobilized wheat germ agglutinin, suggesting that the isolated intact protein is probably a dimer of two glycosylated subunits of similar molecular mass. Treatment of the reduced protein with endoglycosidase F leads to a decrease in its apparent molecular mass by approximately 12 kDa, suggesting that the extent of glycosylation of this polypeptide is approximately 25%.

The analogs were of 3 kinds: (1) analogs of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in which the C-5 CH3 of the base was exchanged for H (AZU) or C2H5 (AZEU); (2) 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (FLT) and analogs thereof, in which the C-5 CH3 of the base was exchanged for H (FLU), C2H5 (FLEU) or nC3H7 (FLPU); (3) the threo analogs of AZT (AZT increases) and AZU (AZU increases). All analogs were less active inhibitors of HIV replication than AZT, except FLT, which was as active as AZT. The 3'-fluoro analogs and AZEU did not inhibit MuLV replication at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Oral administration of FLT to MuLV-infected mice result in antiviral effects only at toxic drug levels. AZU and FLU were less potent inhibitors of HIV replication than AZT or FLT, but the 2'-deoxy uridine analogs were less cytotoxic to human embryonic fibroblasts than the thymidine analogs. The 5'-triphosphates of AZU, AZT, AZEU, FLT and FLEU were tested as inhibitors of the HIV- and MuLV-reverse transcriptases. Ranking of the Ki/Km values for HIV-RT resulted in the following order of potency of the 5'-triphosphates AZT = FLT greater than AZU greater than AZEU greater than FLEU. The 5'-triphosphates of AZEU, FLT and FLEU did not inhibit the MuLV-RT, which explains, in part, the lack of effect of these analogs against MuLV replication. The threo forms (azido ""up"") of AZU and AZT were less active inhibitors of HIV replication than the erythro forms (azido ""down"").

Recombinant DNA technology has produced molecules such as the interferons, which are antigenic and can induce antibody formation as part of a generalized immune response. The frequency of antibody occurrence, the magnitude of the antibody response, and the type of antibody induced by the interferons is thought to be related to several factors. These include the specific type of neoplasm for which interferon was administered; the specie of interferon administered; the dose, route, schedule, and duration of interferon administered; and the assay method and sampling time used to determine the antibody titer.

Due to this translocation, the abl oncogene is coupled to the bcr gene, forming a new determinant in this protein encoded by the bcr-abl joining region. In the joining region itself, either the bcr exon 2 is coupled to the abl exon 2 (b2-a2), or the bcr exon 3 is coupled to the abl exon 2 (b3-a2). Thus, these joining regions form by definition new tumor-specific determinants in the respective chimeric P210-bcr-abl molecules. This paper addresses the question as to whether these tumor-specific joining regions are exposed on the P210bcr-abl molecule in such a way that antibodies can be generated to detect these sites. To test this possibility a polyclonal antiserum, termed BP-1, was raised against a synthetic peptide representative for the b2-a2 joining region. The reactivity of BP-1 was analyzed in an ELISA system on various synthetic peptides. Peptide inhibition studies showed the presence of antibodies to different parts of the b2-a2 peptide in the polyvalent antiserum. The reactivity of BP-1 was then tested with native P210bcr-abl molecules in various CML cell lines (K562, LAMA-84, and BV173) using a protein kinase assay. In this context, the bcr-abl junctions were first analyzed at the DNA and RNA level. The present study indicates that BP-1 specifically recognizes the b2-a2 junction in native P210bcr-abl. Furthermore, BP-1 clearly discriminates between b2-a2 P210bcr-abl and b3-a2 P210bcr-abl. We conclude that the tumor-specific b2-a2 joining region is antigenically exposed on the native P210bcr-abl molecule.","['van Denderen, J', 'Hermans, A', 'Meeuwsen, T', 'Troelstra, C', 'Zegers, N', 'Boersma, W', 'Grosveld, G', 'van Ewijk, W']","['van Denderen J', 'Hermans A', 'Meeuwsen T', 'Troelstra C', 'Zegers N', 'Boersma W', 'Grosveld G', 'van Ewijk W']","['Department of Cell Biology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Epitopes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Oligopeptides/immunology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.169.1.87 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Jan 1;169(1):87-98. doi: 10.1084/jem.169.1.87.,,,,,,PMC2189189,,,

CD5+ B cells from 19 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and one with diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (DWDL) were cultured, with and without mitogenic stimulation, to obtain Ig from these cells. 17 of the 20 samples produced Ig in vitro. mAb from nine of the 17 patients were reactive with either IgG, ssDNA, or dsDNA. In every instance, the autoantibodies displayed monotypic L chain usage that correlated precisely with the L chain expressed on the CD5+ leukemic B cell surface. These monoclonal autoantibodies varied in their degree of antigenic specificity; some were quite specific, reacting with only one antigen, whereas others were polyspecific, reacting with two or all three autoantigens tested. Three features distinguish these autoantibodies from those observed in prior studies of CD5+ B cells. First, they are clearly the products of monoclonal populations of CD5+ cells; second, several react with dsDNA, a specificity not previously reported and often seen in association with significant autoimmune disorders; and third, two of the monoclonal autoantibodies secreted by the CD5+ clones were of the IgG class. Although not all of the Ig-producing, CD5-expressing clones elaborated mAbs reactive with the autoantigens tested, greater than 50% did. It is possible that with a broader autoantigenic panel or with larger quantities of CLL/DWDL-derived Ig, even more autoantibody-producing clones might be identified.

TGF-beta 1 elevates the expression of vitronectin receptors (alpha v beta 3 integrin) in all cells examined including WI-38 human lung fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts, and MG-63 human osteogenic sarcoma cells. TGF-beta 1 action increases the level of mRNA and the synthesis of vitronectin receptor subunits with t1/2 o 3-4 h and 6 h, respectively. TGF-beta 1 up-regulates expression of the intercellular adhesion receptor, LFA-1 (alpha L beta 2), in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells by increasing the synthesis of alpha L subunit but not beta 2 subunit. The increase in alpha L synthesis and assembly into LFA-1 complexes induced by TGF-beta 1 occurs in parallel with elevated fibronectin receptor synthesis in THP-1 cells. These responses to TGF-beta 1 are lost upon phorbol ester-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells into the macrophage phenotype. The results suggest a role of TGF-beta in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions mediated by vitronectin receptors and cell-cell interactions mediated by LFA-1 in the immune system.","['Ignotz, R A', 'Heino, J', 'Massague, J']","['Ignotz RA', 'Heino J', 'Massague J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],['CA39240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Receptors, Vitronectin', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*pharmacology']",1989/01/05 00:00,1989/01/05 00:01,['1989/01/05 00:00'],"['1989/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)31270-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jan 5;264(1):389-92.,,,,,,,,,

No differences were seen in fragmentation of nascent and bulk DNA as judged by DNA double-stranded cleavage and the release of acid-soluble material or subnucleosomal (under 8 S) fragments. In contrast, bleomycin-induced chromatin aggregation (Woynarowski, J.M., Gawron, L.S. and Beerman, T.A. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 910, 149-156) occurred preferentially in nascent chromatin as indicated by a retarded solubilization of nascent chromatin and generation of a fast-sedimenting material (above 45 S) in the sedimentation profiles of drug-released nascent chromatin. This preferential aggregation disappeared completely when chromatin became older than 10 min. The drug aggregation activity did not distinguish nascent and mature presolubilized oligonucleosomes.

Mast cell/nerve interactions in the lung in vitro and in vivo.,S31-4,"A hypothesis is presented that mast cells in and below the epithelium of the respiratory tract show functional association with nerves to form a homeostatic regulatory unit. During inflammation, mast cells may arise in situ as well as by infiltration because epithelium contains both mast cell precursors and produces factors that support their growth in vitro. Structural studies show that mast cells associate with nerves in the lung. Using a tissue culture model, we showed that sympathetic nerves formed lasting contacts with rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Electrophysiologic studies showed that nerve contact increases RBL membrane conductance, which can be mimicked by exogenous substance P (SP). Experiments with sensitized rat tracheal mucosa in Ussing chambers showed functional evidence of interaction of mast cells with SP-containing nerves: changes in short circuit current caused by antigen were blocked by the mast cell stabilizer doxantrazole and reduced by 50% by neonatal pretreatment with capsaicin. Experiments in vivo showed that lung clearance of the aerosol probe 99mTc-DTPA was increased by antigen challenge in sensitized rats. This was blocked by neonatal capsaicin treatment, again implicating SP-containing nerves. Therefore, we conclude that the functional association of mast cells with nerves is an important mechanism in regulating the local epithelial environment.","['Bienenstock, J', 'Perdue, M', 'Blennerhassett, M', 'Stead, R', 'Kakuta, N', 'Sestini, P', 'Vancheri, C', 'Marshall, J']","['Bienenstock J', 'Perdue M', 'Blennerhassett M', 'Stead R', 'Kakuta N', 'Sestini P', 'Vancheri C', 'Marshall J']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University Medical Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am Rev Respir Dis,The American review of respiratory disease,0370523,['33507-63-0 (Substance P)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/physiology', 'Epithelium/physiology/ultrastructure', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inflammation/physiopathology', 'Lung/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Nervous System/immunology/ultrastructure', '*Nervous System Physiological Phenomena', 'Rats', 'Substance P']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1164/ajrccm/138.6_Pt_2.S31 [doi]'],ppublish,Am Rev Respir Dis. 1988 Dec;138(6 Pt 2):S31-4. doi: 10.1164/ajrccm/138.6_Pt_2.S31.,,,,,,,,,

To further evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of Leu-M1 in acute leukemia, we investigated the immunoreactivity of Leu-M1 antigen in a series of 100 plastic-embedded bone marrow biopsies from patients with acute leukemia and compared these results to those obtained in a series of 30 paraffin-embedded specimens. We also investigated the usefulness of neuraminidase pretreatment of sections to enhance the sensitivity of Leu-M1. In plastic sections, we were able to demonstrate positive Leu-M1 staining in 48 of 50 (96%) cases of acute nonlymphoid leukemia (ANL) (FAB classification M1-M5) and 0 of 50 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Comparatively, Leu-M1 stained positively in 10 of 20 (50%) cases of ANL and 0 of 10 ALL embedded in paraffin. In both plastic and paraffin sections, pretreatment with neuraminidase enhanced the sensitivity of Leu-M1 reactivity, but markedly decreased its specificity.

It is proposed that such iron could interact with oxidants generated by certain drugs (e.g. adriamycin or daunorubicin) to facilitate tissue damage, and that some of the side-effects of chemotherapy might be ameliorated by careful co-administration of small doses of desferrioxamine.","['Halliwell, B', 'Aruoma, O I', 'Mufti, G', 'Bomford, A']","['Halliwell B', 'Aruoma OI', 'Mufti G', 'Bomford A']","[""Department of Biochemistry, Medical School, King's College, University of London, England.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin', 'Humans', 'Iron/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",1988/12/05 00:00,1988/12/05 00:01,['1988/12/05 00:00'],"['1988/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(88)81061-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(88)81061-5 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1988 Dec 5;241(1-2):202-4. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(88)81061-5.,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic cells possessed medium to large granules in the cytoplasm, antigens against CD38, CD2, CD25, OKIa1, CD16, TA-1, CD9, CD24 and NKH-1 (N901) monoclonal antibodies on their cell surface, and also showed a high natural killer (NK) activity. Phenotypically, the cells in these disorders were quite different from T gamma leukemia cells bearing Fc receptor or the traditionally reported NK leukemia cells possessing HNK-1 (Leu 7) antigens on their surface. In addition, these leukemias/lymphomas belonged to neither T- nor B-cell lineage, proved by studying clonal gene rearrangement for the T beta and T gamma receptor, and immunoglobulin. Hence, a quite interesting and important point, as suggested by our data, is that all our cases expressed an antigen for NKH-1 (N901), which is detectable on all NK cell surfaces and they lacked the antigen for Leu 7 (HNK-1), which is usually detected on the surface of leukemic NK cells. These facts indicate that we are dealing with a leukemic NK cell subset which is quite different from cells of all other reported cases of NK cell leukemias.

This factor has characteristics similar to those of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), suggesting that the two factors assayed by different methods may be attributable to an identical macromolecule. In a preliminary experiment, we showed that purified natural G-CSF (nG-CSF) could induce NAP in vitro in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). In this study, purified human nG-CSF and recombinant G-CSF (rG-CSF) induced NAP in granulocytes from both normal individuals and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in a dose-dependent fashion in serum-free and serum-containing culture conditions. The induction of NAP by G-CSF was detectable at 0.4 ng/ml and became maximal between 10 and 20 ng/ml. Anti-G-CSF serum incubated with either NAP-IF or rG-CSF inhibited induction of NAP. Morphological examinations revealed that granulocytes cultured with G-CSF were more mature than those cultured without G-CSF, indicating that G-CSF promoted maturation of granulocytes in parallel with NAP induction. These results indicate that NAP-IF in the cystic fluid of a human squamous cell carcinoma is identical to G-CSF and that induction of NAP by G-CSF is really a reflection of cell maturation promoted by G-CSF.","['Sato, N', 'Asano, S', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Yoshida, S', 'Takaku, F', 'Takatani, O']","['Sato N', 'Asano S', 'Koeffler HP', 'Yoshida S', 'Takaku F', 'Takatani O']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/*biosynthesis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Cysts/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Exudates and Transudates/*analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041370209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1988 Nov;137(2):272-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041370209.,,,,,,,,,

CB3717 polyglutamates were measured by HPLC using high specific activity 3H-CB3717. Following the exposure of cells to 50 microM CB3717 for 6, 12 and 24 hr total cellular radioactivity corresponded to 4.5 +/- 1.5, 6.8 +/- 3.6 and 5.9 +/- 3.4 microM drug derived material, respectively. Of this material, greater than 70%, 57 +/- 3% and 51 +/- 5% was in the form of unchanged CB3717 at 6, 12 and 24 hr respectively. The remaining radioactivity was associated with polyglutamate metabolites of CB3717, predominantly the tetra and pentaglutamate forms. Following the removal of extracellular drug after incubation for 24 hr and resuspension in drug free medium, unchanged CB3717 was lost rapidly from the cells such that after 6 hr it accounted for only 5% of total cellular radioactivity. In contrast, levels of CB3717 tetra and pentaglutamates declined solely due to dilution during cell division. Measurement of the whole cell TS activity by 3H-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA indicated that, despite the loss of unchanged CB3717 from the cell, enzyme activity remained suppressed (less than 10% of control) for at least 24 hr after resuspension in drug free medium. The TS inhibitory activity of the polyglutamated metabolites of CB3717 was investigated using enzyme purified from L1210 cells. As inhibitors, the metabolites were 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than CB3717 as the di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate forms, respectively. However, as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase prepared from rat liver, CB3717 polyglutamates were no more than 5-fold More potent than the parent compound. This study has shown that CB3717 can undergo polyglutamation in tumour cells and that the metabolites are preferentially retained giving rise to prolonged TS inhibition. By virtue of their potent TS inhibitory activity these metabolites are, therefore, most probably the intracellular effectors of CB3717 cytotoxicity.","['Sikora, E', 'Jackman, A L', 'Newell, D R', 'Calvert, A H']","['Sikora E', 'Jackman AL', 'Newell DR', 'Calvert AH']","['Section of Drug Development, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(88)90094-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(88)90094-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1988 Nov 1;37(21):4047-54. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90094-9.,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Open label, phase I/II study of G-CSF, given by daily subcutaneous injection for up to 7 weeks. SETTING: Outpatient oncology clinic of a university medical center. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of four patients with hairy cell leukemia complicated by severe neutropenia. Three patients completed the study; one patient was removed after 2 weeks of therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given by daily subcutaneous injection. Each patient began therapy with 1 microgram/kg body weight.d; after 1 week the dose was increased to 3 micrograms/kg.d, and 1 week later to 6 micrograms/kg.d. Therapy was continued for 5 to 6 weeks. Patients were taught self-injection, and administered treatment at home. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In three patients, an increase in absolute neutrophil counts from less than 0.9 X 10(9)/L to greater than 4.0 X 10(9)/L was noted within 2 weeks of beginning G-CSF therapy. In two patients, infections resolved during therapy.

We studied the effect of Ara-C on the RNA transcript levels of two c-oncogenes often associated to cell proliferation and differentiation. In the monoblastic U-937 cell line, where Ara-C has a maximum (100%) monocytic differentiation, RNA transcript level of c-myc is not detectable, whereas c-fos levels are rapidly increased. On the other hand, in the bipotential promyelocytic HL-60 cells, Ara-C induces only 40% monocytic differentiation after 7 days; this is associated to a weaker decrement of c-myc expression; c-fos is however greatly induced 3 log after 2 days treatment, but before monocytic phenotype is observed. Ara-C, at low concentrations, may, by arresting cell proliferation, restore the leukemic's cell proliferation/differentiation equilibrium.

In this respect hematopoiesis is certainly the area in which most data have accumulated. In general IFN-alpha or -beta inhibit cell growth of normal progenitors of hematopoietic lineages. In leukemia cell cultures IFNs may either stimulate or inhibit cell growth and differentiation. We report here different biological effects of murine (mu) IFN-alpha 1, -beta, and -gamma species on the erythroid differentiation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced Friend leukemia cells. Treatment with mu recombinant IFN-beta enhances DMSO-induced FLC differentiation, whereas treatment with IFN-alpha 1 species as well as with natural and recombinant mu IFN-gamma preparations only inhibits it. All these observed effects are neutralized by monoclonal antibodies against IFN-alpha, -beta, and -gamma species. When mu fibroblast IFN (a mixture of alpha and beta species) was used, the inhibitory effect attributable to IFN-alpha was partly overshadowed by the simultaneous presence of a majority of IFN-beta molecules exerting the opposite effect. This is in agreement with data obtained neutralizing fibroblast IFN preparations with excess amounts of monoclonal antibodies against IFN-beta (G.B. Rossi et al., 1988, ""The Status of Differentiation Therapy of Cancer,"" Raven Press, New York) and with our previous reports indicating that mu fibroblast IFN can either enhance or inhibit DMSO-induced differentiation when administered at low (less than 500 U/ml) or high (greater than 5000 U/ml) doses, respectively. The inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha 1 on cell differentiation is not linked to any inhibitory effect on cell growth. Results obtained analyzing the effect of IFN-alpha 1 and -beta on various IFN-resistant FLC clones indicate that different mechanisms underlie the stimulatory effect of IFN-beta and the inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha 1. These results shed light on possibly distinct physiological roles of the various species of IFNs.","['Affabris, E', 'Federico, M', 'Romeo, G', 'Coccia, E M', 'Rossi, G B']","['Affabris E', 'Federico M', 'Romeo G', 'Coccia EM', 'Rossi GB']","['Department of Cellular and Developmental Biology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/analysis"", 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*physiology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon Type I/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interferons/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinases/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(88)90068-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1988 Nov;167(1):185-93. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(88)90068-2.,,,,,,,,,

Analyses of misincorporation rates opposite a single template adenine residue showed that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase catalyzed nucleotide mismatches with a specificity of A:C much greater than A:G greater than A:A. The high error rate of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in vitro translates to approximately five to ten errors per HIV-1 genome per round of replication in vivo. This high error rate suggests that misincorporation by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is, at least in part, responsible for the hypermutability of the AIDS virus.

Both CD10+ CD19+ and CD10+ CD19- precursor populations proliferated in vitro to form B-cell precursor colonies under stimulation from low molecular weight B-cell growth factor (L-BCGF) or recombinant interleukin 3 but did not respond to high molecular weight B-cell growth factor (H-BCGF). The colonies derived from the CD10+ CD19- fraction showed induction of CD19 expression in 10-50% of growing cells, suggesting that CD10 expression precedes CD19 expression in B-cell ontogeny. This hypothesis was corroborated by less-differentiated marker profiles of the progeny of CD10+ CD19- B-cell precursors as compared to CD10+ CD19+ B-cell precursors in BCGF-stimulated cultures and by higher percentages of CD10+CD19- versus CD10-CD19+ B-cell precursors.

Comparison of neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity with other histamine-releasing factors.,3575-83,"Human neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity (HRA-N) was partially purified and found to contain a heat-stable 1400 to 2300-Da fraction which caused human basophils and rat basophil leukemia cells (RBL) to degranulate. The capacity of HRA-N to activate basophils was not related to the gender or atopic status of the basophil donor, but was related to anti-IgE responsiveness. Several lines of evidence suggest that HRA-N and anti-IgE induce histamine release through distinctly different mechanisms: 1) the time course of HRA-N- and anti-IgE-induced RBL histamine release are different; 2) HRA-N causes histamine release from RBL with and without surface-bound IgE; 3) lactic acid stripping of IgE from human basophils reduces anti-IgE-induced histamine release, but has no consistent effect on HRA-N-induced histamine release; and 4) passive sensitization of lactic acid-stripped basophils with IgE restores anti-IgE-induced histamine release but not HRA-N-induced histamine release. Several histamine-releasing factors (HRF) were compared with HRA-N. Human nasal HRF (HRF-NW, crude and partially purified fractions of 15 to 30, 3.5 to 9, and less than 3.5 kDa), like HRA-N, caused equal histamine release from both native and IgE-sensitized RBL. However, only the 15- to 30-kDa fraction caused histamine release from human basophils in the doses tested. Mononuclear cell HRF (HRF-M, crude and a partially purified 25 kDa Mr fraction) and platelet HRF (HRF-P, crude preparation) failed to cause histamine release from either native or IgE-sensitized RBL but caused 30 +/- 5.5% and 20 +/- 10% net histamine release from human basophils, respectively. HRA-N and HRF-NW were both stable to boiling. These data, taken together, suggest that the capacity of HRA-N to induce RBL and human basophil histamine release and of HRF-NW to stimulate RBL histamine release is independent of IgE. The data further suggest that HRA-N and HRF-NW can be distinguished by size, and that they both differ from mononuclear cell HRF and platelet HRF. Thus, it appears that inflammatory cells generate a family of distinct HRF.","['White, M V', 'Kaplan, A P', 'Haak-Frendscho, M', 'Kaliner, M']","['White MV', 'Kaplan AP', 'Haak-Frendscho M', 'Kaliner M']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['A107507-03/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lactates)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*immunology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blood Platelets/analysis/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Stability', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/physiology', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Nasal Mucosa/analysis/immunology', 'Neutrophils/analysis/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1']",1988/11/15 00:00,1988/11/15 00:01,['1988/11/15 00:00'],"['1988/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Nov 15;141(10):3575-83.,,,,,,,,,

Two other mammalian neurokinins, neurokinin A and neurokinin B, were also found to induce secretion of IL-1-like activity in P388D1 cells. These findings suggest that activation of immune cells by neuromodulators can contribute to the maintenance of the chronic inflammatory state and the immunopathology observed in arthritic disease mediated by IL-1.

A potential autocrine role for interleukin 1 in epidermis.,1787-92,"Cultured human keratinocytes have been shown to produce IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA and protein. IL-1 biological activity has been identified in normal human epidermis; in vitro, most biologically active IL-1 resides in a cell-associated compartment. The potential for autocrine effects of IL-1 on human keratinocytes was assessed by measurement of keratinocyte IL-1 receptors. Both high- and low-affinity cell surface receptors that bound recombinant (r) IL-1 alpha and beta with comparable affinities could be identified on cultured human keratinocytes, using 125I-labeled rIL-1. Chemical crosslinking experiments identified a cell surface molecule of roughly 72,500 Mr that bound 125I-labeled IL-1, similar to the molecular weight of previously described IL-1 receptors on fibroblasts, B cells, and T cells. To assess the biological consequences of keratinocyte IL-1 binding, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene expression was measured. The addition of exogenous rIL-1 alpha led to a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA, as measured by a sensitive and specific S1 nuclease assay. This increase in mRNA was reflected in a marked increase in GM-CSF biological activity as measured by proliferation of blast cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. The biological activity was completely inhibitable by an antibody to human rGM-CSF. GM-CSF activates mature neutrophils and macrophages and appears to enhance the efficiency of Langerhans cell antigen presentation to T cells. Release of IL-1 from injured or activated keratinocytes may lead to enhanced epidermal GM-CSF gene expression via an autocrine mechanism, thus enhancing local host defense.","['Kupper, T S', 'Lee, F', 'Birchall, N', 'Clark, S', 'Dower, S']","['Kupper TS', 'Lee F', 'Birchall N', 'Clark S', 'Dower S']","['Department of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],['AI-25082/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Keratins', 'Molecular Weight', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI113792 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1988 Nov;82(5):1787-92. doi: 10.1172/JCI113792.,,,,,,PMC442749,,,

Phenotypic analysis and morphologic characterization of the proliferating cells demonstrated a rapid decrease in CD34+ cells and an exponential increase in the number of cells belonging to the neutrophilic, eosinophilic, monocyte/macrophage, and thrombocytic lineages. When combined with recombinant human erythropoietin, burst colonies and cells expressing glycophorin-A were detected, thereby demonstrating the effects of hIL-3 on erythroid progenitors. Further, the development of mixed-erythroid colonies indicated that multipotential cells within CD34-enriched fractions responded to hIL-3. In addition, we examined the effect of hIL-3 on the proliferation of primary acute myeloblastic leukemia cells in liquid culture. We found that hIL-3 was able to induce cell proliferation in a proportion of the cases tested. Heterogeneity of the responses to hIL-3 was in part related to French-American-British classification but could not be correlated with CD34 antigen expression by the leukemic cells.

Both forms of TGF-beta suppressed both the normal cellular proliferation and colony formation induced by recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the presence of GM-CSF or IL-3, optimal concentrations of TGF-beta (400 pmol/L) inhibited colony formation by erythroid (BFU-E), multipotential (CFU-GEMM), and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells by 90% to 100%, whereas granulocyte or monocyte cluster formation was not inhibited. In contrast, neither form of TGF-beta had any effect on G-CSF-induced hematopoiesis. The suppressive action appeared to be mediated directly by TGF-beta since antiproliferative responses were also observed in accessory cell-depleted bone marrow cells. In contrast to normal bone marrow cells, both GM- and G-CSF-induced proliferation of cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by TGF-beta. Differential effects of TGF-beta on the proliferation of established leukemic lines were also observed since most cell lines of myelomonocytic nature studied were strongly inhibited where erythroid cell lines were either insensitive or poorly inhibited by TGF-beta. These results suggest that TGF-beta is an important modulator of human hematopoiesis that selectively regulates the growth of less mature hematopoietic cell populations with a high proliferative capacity as opposed to more differentiated cells, which are not affected by TGF-beta.","['Sing, G K', 'Keller, J R', 'Ellingsworth, L R', 'Ruscetti, F W']","['Sing GK', 'Keller JR', 'Ellingsworth LR', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Facility 21701.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Reactions', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79231-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Nov;72(5):1504-11.,,,,,,,,,

The study objective was to assess the prevalence of activation of blood coagulation and/or activation of fibrinolysis in APL. Coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters relevant to the objective included antithrombin III, plasminogen, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products and alpha-2 antiplasmin activity and antigen levels. The results of this study revealed consistently normal antithrombin III levels, both before and in the course of antileukaemic treatment. Plasminogen levels were slightly decreased or normal. However, a distinct alpha-2 antiplasmin activity deficiency in all patients was observed with levels even reaching zero in three patients, during chemotherapy. Alpha-2 antiplasmin activity levels were consistently lower than the alpha-2 antiplasmin antigen levels. The in vitro binding of alpha-2 antiplasmin activity to fibrin clots was severely reduced which appeared to be due to the reduced alpha-2 antiplasmin plasma levels. Upon crossed-immunoelectrophoresis against alpha-2 antiplasmin antiserum two alpha-2 antiplasmin antigen peaks were observed in the plasma of all nine patients. All abnormalities were reversible 4 d after completion of chemotherapy. In a second series of 12 consecutive APL patients we confirmed the consistency of the alpha-2 antiplasmin activity deficiency and normal antithrombin III plasma levels. In addition Protein C activity and antigen levels were normal or near normal in 10 and reduced in two patients. Thrombin-antithrombin III complexes were increased in 10 and normal in two patients. We conclude that some activation of blood coagulation is present in APL (increased thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels) but its contribution to the coagulopathy seems to be minor (normal antithrombin III and only slightly reduced protein C levels). The observed reduced alpha-2 antiplasmin content of the fibrin clot in vitro may result in vivo in a fibrin clot that is highly susceptible to fibrin degradation, thus aggravating the coagulopathy in APL.","['Avvisati, G', 'ten Cate, J W', 'Sturk, A', 'Lamping, R', 'Petti, M G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Avvisati G', 'ten Cate JW', 'Sturk A', 'Lamping R', 'Petti MG', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University of Rome, La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/*deficiency']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02432.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Sep;70(1):43-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02432.x.,,,,,,,,,

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is expressed in most patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and a minority of patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Thirteen patients with ANLL and greater than 30% blasts positive for TdT were studied to establish the clinical, light microscopic, cytochemical, immunologic, and ultrastructural correlates of this phenomenon. Most patients demonstrated some morphologic and cytochemical features of monocytic differentiation. On cytochemical stains, nine had greater than 3% Sudan black-positive blasts. Diffuse alpha naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) staining of leukemic cells was present in nine cases, though extremely weak in seven. Blasts in ten patients did not express any other markers of lymphoid differentiation except TdT. However, two patient's immature cells bore CD10 common ALL antigen (CALLA) and CD19 (B4). Ultrastructural studies confirmed nonlymphoid differentiation in all ten patients studied, with a prominent monocytic component present in nine. In no case was a second population of lymphoblasts identified to account for TdT positivity. These patients responded poorly to conventional therapy for ANLL, with complete remissions in 3 of 13 (23%). With conventional therapy for ALL, complete remission was achieved in only two of nine (22%) patients. However, four of seven (57%) patients had a complete remission with high-dose cytosine arabinoside regimens. The authors' studies suggest that patients with TdT-positive ANLL represent a distinct subset that usually displays ultrastructural evidence for monocytic differentiation and is clinically significant in that these patients respond poorly to conventional therapy for both ALL and ANLL. Recognition of the monocytic lineage of these cases by light microscopic examination is difficult because they are often poorly differentiated morphologically and express only weak nonspecific esterase positivity.","['McCurley, T L', 'Greer, J P', 'Glick, A D']","['McCurley TL', 'Greer JP', 'Glick AD']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Staining and Labeling']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/90.4.421 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1988 Oct;90(4):421-30. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/90.4.421.,,,,,,,,,

Three tumors that are unusually sensitive to IFN-a are chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the benign phase, hairy-cell leukemia, and the T-cell lymphomas associated with mycosis fungoides. Studies using partially purified IFN-a or IFN-A2a (Roferon-A) therapy have shown that most patients with benign-phase CML achieve hematologic remission. Furthermore, in some patients, long-term therapy results in hematologic remission and complete suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome. Early intervention, within six months after diagnosis, increases the response rate among CML patients treated with IFN-A2a. IFN-a, IFN-A2a (Roferon-A) and IFN-A2b (Intron A) are remarkably active against hairy-cell leukemia, with similar results achieved in clinical studies. The question of antibody formation in trials of recombinant IFN-a products will be discussed in this paper. Neutralizing antibody development and antibody positivity as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been reported with both IFN-A2a and IFN-A2b (Intron A), but the rate reported with IFN-A2b was significantly lower. However, possible differences in the sensitivity of the assays have been mentioned. The effects of differing dosing regimens also were noted. Additional trials conducted by clinical investigators using identical methods will help answer questions arising from these discrepancies and determine the full value of interferon in cancer therapy.","['Gutterman, J U']",['Gutterman JU'],"['University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1988 Jul;25(3 Suppl 3):3-8.,15,,,,,,,,

Fourteen of the cases were classified as early B-lineage ALL, 3 cases were other ALL subtypes, and 14 of the cases were ANLL. Five of the 17 cases of ALL expressed one or more myeloid-associated surface Ags, 3 ANLL cases expressed CD10 (CALLA, J5), and T-lymphoid Ags were present in 12 of 31 cases (1 T-cell ALL, 3 of 16 B-lineage ALL cases, and 8 of 14 ANLL cases). Eleven of 12 CD34+ ALL cases studied had abnormal karyotypes; only 7 of 12 CD34+ ANLL cases studied had abnormal karyotypes, and 3 of these were CD10+ ANLL. Six cases were Ph1 positive, including the one mature B cell ALL, 4 early B-lineage ALL, and 1 CD10+ ANLL case. Good and poor prognosis subgroups of high frequency of expression of CD34 leukemias could be identified, generally, as would have been predicted by previously defined criteria. Thus, of the 10 Ph1-negative early B-lineage ALL patients, 9 achieved CR (90%). At the other extreme, the CR rate of CD10- ANLL was 4 of 11 (36%).

In this study, NDV strain 73-T and a wild-type isolate of NDV were found to be potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production by both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and rat splenocytes. Antibody inhibition experiments identified TNF-alpha as the major species of TNF induced by NDV in PBMCs. The effect of recombinant human TNF-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha) on human cancer cells was then examined. Neither rHuTNF-alpha nor supernatants from NDV-stimulated PBMCs were cytotoxic toward the TNF-resistant human malignant melanoma cell line MEL-14. However, when MEL-14 cells were treated with NDV strain 73-T, both rHuTNF-alpha and supernatants from NDV-stimulated PBMCs killed 48% and 55%, respectively, of these tumor cells. Treatment with NDV also conferred TNF susceptibility to the TNF-resistant human malignant melanoma cell line MEL-21 and the human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562.

Production of IFN induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), Corynebacterium parvum, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were studied in the peripheral leukocytes from the patients and from 21 control persons by means of a whole blood technique. All three groups of patients with NHL had significantly reduced production upon stimulation by NDV (p ranged between 0.0038 and less than 0.0001) compared to controls. Similarly, C. parvum also induced lower titers of IFN in the leukocytes of patients with non-leukemic NHL (p = 0.0015 for low-grade NHL and p = 0.0038 for high-grade NHL). When stimulated by PHA, the IFN response of all groups of patients was within normal range. With the exception in low-grade NHL, Con A also induced normal titers of IFN in the patients with NHL. The levels of IFN induced by PWM, HSV, and IL-2 were very low and no differences between controls and patients could be found. As NDV and C. parvum induce mainly IFN-alpha and the mitogens PHA and Con A mainly IFN-gamma, our results suggest that there is a deficiency in the IFN-alpha response in the patients with NHL but normal response in IFN-gamma. This deficiency may have implications for the choice of subtypes of IFN in the treatment of NHL.","['Ho, A D', 'Moritz, T', 'Rensch, K', 'Hunstein, W', 'Kirchner, H']","['Ho AD', 'Moritz T', 'Rensch K', 'Hunstein W', 'Kirchner H']","['Medizinische Universitats-Poliklinik, Heidelberg, FRG.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,"['0 (Interferon Inducers)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Inducers/pharmacology', 'Interferons/*deficiency', 'Leukocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1988.8.405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1988 Aug;8(4):405-13. doi: 10.1089/jir.1988.8.405.,,,,,,,,,

Both proliferative and cytolytic responses to FBL were measured and compared to similar responses to minor histocompatibility Ag. The addition of alpha IL-2 partially inhibited FBL-stimulated proliferation of purified L3T4+ T cells and nearly completely inhibited the response of Lyt-2+ T cells, whereas alpha IL-4 partially inhibited the proliferative response of the L3T4+ subset but had no effect on the response of the Lyt-2+ subset. The addition of exogenous IL-4 augmented the proliferative response of both subsets. Therefore, IL-4 is an endogenous growth factor for FBL-induced specific proliferation of the L3T4+ and not the Lyt-2+ population, but both subpopulations can respond to IL-4. Similar examination of anti-FBL CTL responses revealed that alpha IL-2, but not alpha IL-4, inhibited FBL-specific Lyt-2+ CTL generation. However, exogenous IL-4 partially replaced the L3T4+ Th cell activity necessary for optimal Lyt-2+ FBL-specific CTL generation. Therefore, IL-4 is not required but can participate in the CTL response. The role of IL-4 during the immune response of B6 mice to minor histocompatibility Ag disparate BALB.B cells was analyzed. alpha IL-4 had no detectable effect on the proliferative or cytolytic response to BALB.B cells, suggesting that endogenous IL-4 does not have a significant role in these responses. The extent of involvement of endogenous IL-4 in the T cell responses to retrovirus-induced tumor Ag and minor histocompatibility Ag presumably reflects the nature of the stimulating Ag, and detection of an IL-4 response may correlate with induction of an antibody response. Thus, the immunizing Ag and/or host B cell repetoire may influence which subsets of L3T4+ Th cells are activated during priming in vivo.","['Kern, D E', 'Peace, D J', 'Klarnet, J P', 'Cheever, M A', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Kern DE', 'Peace DJ', 'Klarnet JP', 'Cheever MA', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/classification/immunology']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Oct 15;141(8):2824-30.,,,,,,,,,

Cell. Physiol. 121:526-532, 1984). We investigate here the EP requirements of FVA cells in vitro for viability, proliferation, and maturation. By delaying the addition of EP to FVA cell cultures or by withdrawing EP at early times of culture, the subsequent viability, cell numbers, and maturation were diminished. The longer the delay in EP addition or the earlier the EP withdrawal, the more diminished these parameters were when compared to cultures which contained EP throughout the 48 h of differentiation. FVA cells had a period of EP requirement in vitro that lasted for only 24 h or less after the initiation of culture. During these crucial first 24 h, EP induced an increase in the synthesis of all size classes of RNA. Protein synthesis was maintained at a stable level in cells cultured with EP, but it declined in cells cultured without it. In contrast, the synthesis rate of DNA and the content of DNA per cell were not affected by the presence of EP in the culture. However, FVA cells cultured without EP had progressive accumulation of small sized DNA due to breakage of higher molecular weight DNA. The rate of DNA breakdown was sufficient to prevent DNA accumulation and thus it probably plays a role in the abortion of cell proliferation. No such breakage was found in cells cultured with EP. Our results indicate that EP exerts an effect on FVA cells in culture which is reflected in their viability, cell number, and maturation. This effect is not mediated by a stimulation of the rate of DNA synthesis, but is accompanied by stimulation of overall RNA synthesis and maintenance of protein synthesis.","['Koury, M J', 'Bondurant, M C']","['Koury MJ', 'Bondurant MC']","['Division of Hematology, Vanderbilt Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],['DK-31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Erythroblasts/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/physiology']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041370108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1988 Oct;137(1):65-74. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041370108.,,,,,,,,,

Subfractions were selected and examined for their relative intensity of HLA class I and CD1 antigens as determined by cytofluorometric analysis. Two subfractions were characterized as follows: an immature population (Fr6 PNA-) expressed a high level of CD1 (OKT6 binding) antigen and a low level of class I HLA antigen; and a more mature fraction (Fr3 PNA-) expressed minimal amounts of CD1 antigen and relatively high levels of HLA class I molecules. Fr6 PNA+ and Fr3 PNA- thymocytes were tested for their reactivity with a panel of non-HLA alloantibodies as determined by cytofluorometric analysis. We observed that three alloantibodies demonstrated strong fluorescence staining with Fr6 PNA+ thymocytes only, whereas three other alloantibodies reacted with both the Fr6 PNA+ and the Fr3 PNA- subfractions. All six alloantibodies failed to react with peripheral T cells. However, the six antibodies did react with a panel of cultured T lymphoblastoid leukemic cells and fresh leukemic T cells. Blocking studies demonstrated that these alloantibodies do not bind beta 2-microglobulin-associated determinants.

Pre-commitment cells have completed the early events in the processes leading ultimately to terminal differentiation and require only an abbreviated subsequent exposure to inducer for onset of terminal differentiation. The pre-commitment state has 2 properties relevant to the present communication: (1) when induced by retinoic acid (RA), it has a characteristic duration following removal of the RA; and (2) it can also be induced by a pulse exposure to hydroxyurea. In the present studies, it was observed that after exposure of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells to RA for 24 hr (ca. one division cycle) their levels of c-myc RNA were elevated. The c-myc RNA level then remained elevated for several subsequent division cycles despite the removal of retinoic acid. Thus, retinoic acid induced a change in HL-60 c-myc RNA levels which was sustained regardless of the continued presence or absence of RA. The elevation, decreasing to control levels 3 division cycles after termination of the pulse exposure, paralleled the known duration of the pre-commitment memory state. Furthermore, a pulse exposure of HL-60 cells to a subcytotoxic dose of hydroxyurea, which is also known to induce a pre-commitment state, also induced an elevation of c-myc RNA levels. The observed changes in c-myc levels were not common to all oncogenes. C-fos responded differently to the retinoic acid treatment. Furthermore, although hydroxyurea affected c-myc levels, it did not alter c-fos levels. Most significantly, the present results suggest a cellular function for the c-myc gene product, which is derivation of the pre-commitment state.","['Guernsey, D L', 'Yen, A']","['Guernsey DL', 'Yen A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910420419 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Oct 15;42(4):576-81. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910420419.,,,,,,,,,

Responses differ from normal blood B cells and are restricted to certain morphologic subsets.,521-8,"By raising monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against B cells, a number of cell surface molecules have recently been identified which after binding by their specific antibody can trigger B cells, either alone or in co-operation with antibodies to surface immunoglobulin (sIg). The anti-CD20 (Bp35) MAb IF5 can deliver a strong activation signal to resting normal B cells, and the anti-CDw40 (Bp50) MAb G28-5 can promote activated G1 B cells to enter S phase. These antibodies were tested for their functional effects in vitro on suspended cells from 17 follicle-center-cell (FCC) lymphomas, 5 cases of chronic lymphatic B-cell leukemia (B-CLL) and 8 cases of various histological types. Changes in cellular volume, RNA and DNA synthesis were compared with the results obtained with a polyclonal anti-mu [F(ab')2] antiserum, a MAb to surface IgM (AF6), 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and B-cell growth factor (low-molecular-weight BCGF). Our data reveal differences in the requirements for triggering of various B-cell subsets: cells from CLL responded strongly to TPA but not to anti-mu, which is a potent stimulator not only of normal B cells but also of cells from individual cases of FCC lymphomas. Our observations suggest that the differentiation stage of B-CLL cells is distinct from that of small resting B cells from peripheral blood. Centrocytic lymphomas could not be activated by any of the reagents. CD20-mediated triggering was seen in neoplastic B cells from only 4 of 30 cases, indicating that most B-cell neoplasias were not responsive to this activation pathway. In contrast, the anti-CDw40 MAb consistently stimulated DNA synthesis together with anti-mu or TPA in cells from FCC lymphomas, but not from CLL. Together, these results suggest that activation in different neoplastic B-cell subsets depends on distinct signal transduction mechanisms.","['Beiske, K', 'Clark, E A', 'Holte, H', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Smeland, E B', 'Godal, T']","['Beiske K', 'Clark EA', 'Holte H', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Smeland EB', 'Godal T']","['Department of Pathology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910420409 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Oct 15;42(4):521-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910420409.,,,,,,,,,

The expression of these proto-oncogenes was studied in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells during (i) normal replication, (ii) DMSO-induced differentiation and (iii), alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-restricted cell division and differentiation. The RNA levels of c-myc, c-myb, and p53 were all elevated during normal cellular proliferation; only c-myc expression declined when the cells stopped dividing although the rate of transcription for the gene was unaltered. In contrast, treatment of the cells with DFMO resulted in gradual cessation of cell replication and a decrease in transcription of c-myc, c-myb and p53. When the MEL cells were induced to differentiate with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a transient reduction in c-myc and c-myb RNA levels occurred immediately prior to the G1 arrest with a concomitant decrease in transcriptional activity, while p53 mRNA production was elevated without an increase in transcription. Similar changes of the proto-oncogene levels were observed when the MEL cells were incubated with DFMO and then later induced with DMSO, a protocol which restricts differentiation of the MEL cells. From these experiments we conclude that (i) c-myc, c-myb, and p53 are regulated independently at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, (ii) DFMO inhibits MEL cell proliferation and expression of several genes, including c-myc, c-myb and p53, and (iii) DFMO suppresses terminal differentiation but is unable to alter proto-oncogene changes associated with the early stages of differentiation.","['Klinken, S P', 'Holmes, K L', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Thorgeirsson, S S']","['Klinken SP', 'Holmes KL', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Thorgeirsson SS']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/analysis/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-4827(88)90390-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1988 Oct;178(2):185-98. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(88)90390-4.,,,,,,,,,

An RSV mutant with a Val-Pro insertion in the finger motif of p12 is able to partially encapsidate genomic RNA but is not infectious because mutated p12 is incapable of positioning the replication primer, tRNATrp.

Methotrexate at 60 mg/kg i.p. reduced the viability of logarithmically growing ascites cells (55% active S phase cells) to 28% of control, whereas the viability of the slowly growing cells (18% active S phase) was decreased to only 59% of control. Log phase tumor cells accumulated 8-fold higher levels of methotrexate polyglutamates compared to cells that had approached the stationary phase. However, no differences between log phase and slowly growing tumor cells were observed in the cellular levels of unmetabolized methotrexate. Intestinal mucosa and bone marrow from non-tumor-bearing mice resembled slowly growing tumor cells and had markedly lower levels of methotrexate polyglutamates than logarithmically growing cells. The greater accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates in the logarithmically growing tumor cells was consistent with an increased synthesis of methotrexate polyglutamates in these cells. The enhanced methotrexate polyglutamylation in log phase versus slowly growing cells was not related to changes in the rates of either cellular methotrexate transport, transmembrane efflux of methotrexate, or hydrolysis of methotrexate polyglutamates. Thymidylate synthase activity measured in situ and in extracts from log phase cells was 4- and 2-fold higher, respectively, than in the more slowly growing cells. Methotrexate produced a 2.4-fold greater depletion of poly-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroylglutamate in log phase cells compared to slowly growing cells, and this was a function of both the increased methotrexate polyglutamate accumulation and thymidylate synthase activity in the rapidly proliferating cells. These results provide further evidence that the selectivity of methotrexate for tumors with a high growth fraction is a consequence of the rapid rates of both cellular methotrexate polyglutamate synthesis and oxidation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl polyglutamates by thymidylate synthase.","['Fernandes, D J', 'Sur, P', 'Kute, T E', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Fernandes DJ', 'Sur P', 'Kute TE', 'Capizzi RL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Oct 15;48(20):5638-44.,,,,,,,,,

For three of these (erythropoietin, G-CSF, and GM-CSF), phase I and II studies have been completed and promising results have been obtained. Of particular relevance to the field of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been the finding that G-CSF and GM-CSF could shorten the period of neutropenia in patients treated with chemotherapy, including regimens requiring BMT support. Doses of up to 240 micrograms/m2 of GM-CSF have been well tolerated and have increased the peripheral blood neutrophil count in a dose-dependent manner. At higher doses, eosinophils and monocytes were also increased. A continuous infusion over at least 2 h was found to be superior to bolus administration in terms of both efficacy and reduced side effects. These have usually been mild, but bone pain, headache, fatigue and elevated temperature have been encountered. The rise in neutrophil numbers shortly after initiating treatment with GM-CSF is probably due to neutrophil demargination. After a few days increased bone marrow cellularity has also been noted. In addition to these effects on cell numbers, enhancement of granulocyte and monocyte functions has been documented.

In this study mouse leukaemia L1210 was cloned in vitro by limiting dilution and one cloned line was recloned in vivo. Four subcloned tumour cell lines (A,D,R,S) were xenogenized in vivo by DTIC treatment (A/DTIC, D/DTIC, R/DTIC, S/DTIC) following a schedule previously described. Up to 10(7) cells of these xenogenized subclones, injected i.p., were rejected by syngeneic hosts, although they grew in immunosuppressed hosts. The DTIC treated subclones were lysed by in vivo-primed, in vitro-restimulated (with the relevant subclone) lymphocytes. The cytotoxic lymphocyte activity was not strictly specific since parental, DTIC-untreated cells were also lysed, although less efficiently. CTL directed against the D/DTIC subclone were cloned by limiting dilution. Ninety-four CTL clones were assayed against L1210 subcloned cells, DTIC-treated and untreated, and against different murine tumours (syngeneic or allogenic). Three specific antigens could be identified in the 51Cr release assay. The DTIC subclones expressed one antigen that was specifically recognized by a set of CTL clones. A number of CTL clones were able to lyse the L1210 subcloned cell exclusively, targetting a tumour-associated antigen that did not appear to be modified in the DTIC-treated subclones. A third antigen was demonstrated in the parental and DTIC treated D subclone. On the basis of these results it was postulated that there was at least one common DTIC-inducible antigen specific and reproducible within an identical cell population. Moreover, DTIC treatment did not modify histocompatibility antigens or TAA pre-existing in L1210 cells. The findings discussed here provide new information about permanent xenogenization of tumour cells, which might be exploited for experimental chemo-immunotherapy of cancer.","['Marelli, O', 'Franco, P', 'Canti, G', 'Ricci, L', 'Prandoni, N', 'Nicolin, A', 'Festenstein, H']","['Marelli O', 'Franco P', 'Canti G', 'Ricci L', 'Prandoni N', 'Nicolin A', 'Festenstein H']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Milan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells', 'Dacarbazine/pharmacology', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1988.186 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1988 Aug;58(2):171-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1988.186.,,,,,,PMC2246753,,,

Here we show that one of these mutations characterized by a T----C substitution at position -175 in a conserved octamer (ATGCAAAT) sequence, abolishes the ability of a ubiquitous octamer binding nuclear protein to bind a gamma-globin promoter fragment containing the mutated sequence; however, the ability of two erythroid specific proteins to bind the same fragment is increased three to five fold. DMS interference and binding experiments with mutated fragments indicate that the ubiquitous protein recognizes the octamer sequence, while the erythroid specific proteins B2, B3 recognize flanking nucleotides. Competition experiments indicate that protein B2 corresponds to an erythroid-specific protein known to bind to a consensus GATAG sequence present at several locations in alpha, beta and gamma-globin genes. Although the distal CCAAT box region of the gamma-globin gene shows a related sequence, an oligonucleotide including this sequence does not show any ability to bind the above mentioned erythroid protein; instead, it binds a different erythroid specific protein, in addition to a ubiquitous protein. The -117 G----A mutation also known to cause HPFH, and mapping two nucleotides upstream from the CCAAT box, greatly decreases the binding of the erythroid-specific, but not that of the ubiquitous protein, to the CCAAT box region fragment.","['Mantovani, R', 'Malgaretti, N', 'Nicolis, S', 'Ronchi, A', 'Giglioni, B', 'Ottolenghi, S']","['Mantovani R', 'Malgaretti N', 'Nicolis S', 'Ronchi A', 'Giglioni B', 'Ottolenghi S']","['Dipartimento di Genetica e di Biologia dei Microrganismi, Universita di Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding']",1988/08/25 00:00,1988/08/25 00:01,['1988/08/25 00:00'],"['1988/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/16.16.7783 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1988 Aug 25;16(16):7783-97. doi: 10.1093/nar/16.16.7783.,,,,,,PMC338490,,,

Thus, IL 3, IL 5, and GM-CSF induce human eosinophils to augment proteoglycan biosynthesis by increasing the size of the newly synthesized proteoglycans and their individual chondroitin sulfate chains.","['Rothenberg, M E', 'Pomerantz, J L', 'Owen, W F Jr', 'Avraham, S', 'Soberman, R J', 'Austen, K F', 'Stevens, R L']","['Rothenberg ME', 'Pomerantz JL', 'Owen WF Jr', 'Avraham S', 'Soberman RJ', 'Austen KF', 'Stevens RL']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['AI-22531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-22563/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-23401/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (xylosides)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Chondroitin Lyases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chondroitin Lyases/metabolism', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Deoxyglucose/metabolism', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/metabolism', 'Glycosides/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Pronase/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/*blood/genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sulfates/metabolism']",1988/09/25 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/09/25 00:00'],"['1988/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)68329-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Sep 25;263(27):13901-8.,,,,,,,,,

The responses to single-agent therapy can be grouped as shown in Table 7. Interferon is likely to be the treatment of choice for hairy cell leukemia and possibly also for symptomatic nodular lymphoma. Interferon is very useful in treating papillomas and condylomas, and its role as a local agent will probably expand. The list of responding cancers for alpha interferon or other subtypes as a single agent is unlikely to expand greatly over the next few years. Nevertheless, in both melanoma and renal carcinoma, meaningful responses do occur. It is important to be aware of the possibility of both delayed and increasing extent of response with duration of treatment; adequate trials of interferon may therefore require longer periods of treatment than does conventional chemotherapy. Furthermore, because prior failure to respond to chemotherapy does not predict response to interferon, its use as a second-line agent should also be considered. The future of such biological agents, however, clearly lies in combination with other agents as the ""fourth arm"" of cancer therapy. The challenge is to define what the role of that fourth arm will be. There seems to be a clear choice with the interferons. They can be used at pharmacological doses, in which case their antiproliferative effect is likely to be due to induction of certain enzymes that result in a cytostatic effect in susceptible cancers, of which there are a limited but therapeutically important number. Alternatively, the interferons can be used at physiological doses, which are more likely to cause immunological and cell membrane effects such as NK-cell stimulation, as well as Fc-receptor and tumor-antigen expression. Thus, combination with cytotoxic agents may well require high doses, whereas combination with other biological agents, such as monoclonal antibodies or LAK cells, may be most effective at much lower doses. Over the next few years it will be important to establish the optimal biological doses of the interferons, so that we can maximize their usefulness in therapy and avoid the trap of thinking of them as purely cytotoxic agents.","['Goldstein, D', 'Laszlo, J']","['Goldstein D', 'Laszlo J']","['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, Madison.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,CA Cancer J Clin,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,0370647,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Interferons/adverse effects/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3322/canjclin.38.5.258 [doi]'],ppublish,CA Cancer J Clin. 1988 Sep-Oct;38(5):258-77. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.38.5.258.,99,,,,,,,,

In particular, the Ig heavy-chain gene rearrangement was largely prevalent, and the germ line configuration was almost absent. However, in three of eight cases, high levels of MPO mRNA were detected. The remarkable homogeneity of the cell populations examined suggests that the MPO mRNA observed was present in cellular elements certainly identified as lymphoid.

In normal erythroblasts, R-PK synthesis was constant throughout erythroid maturation, whereas M2-PK synthesis decreased to the point of becoming undetectable.

Furthermore, the correlation between increased susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection and reduced 2-5AS activity was recognized in the Mo-MLV persistently infected cells. The decrease of enzyme activity was confirmed by a solid phase reaction and an analysis of reaction products by Fast Polynucleotide Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) in addition to a liquid phase reaction. In a solid-phase reaction, the enzyme protein binds to polyinosinate-cytidylate (Poly I:C) agarose beads and other cellular proteins can be washed out from the reaction mixtures. Therefore, these results indicate that the decrease of IFN-induced enzyme activity is due to the suppression of transcription and/or translation of 2-5AS mRNA. A decreased amount of 2-5AS mRNA in persistently infected cells was observed by Northern blot and dot-blot hybridization. On the other hand, cell lysate of Mo-MLV infected cells inhibited the 2-5AS activity in liquid phase reaction. The inhibition may also be partly due to the degradation of oligo-2',5'-adenylate (2-5A) formed by 2-5AS.","['Fujii, N', 'Oguma, K', 'Yamashita, T', 'Fujinaga, K', 'Kakinuma, M', 'Yashiki, T']","['Fujii N', 'Oguma K', 'Yamashita T', 'Fujinaga K', 'Kakinuma M', 'Yashiki T']","['Department of Microbiology, Sapporo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis"", 'Animals', 'Cell Extracts/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytoplasm', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-1702(88)90072-X [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(88)90072-x [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1988 Jun;10(4):303-14. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(88)90072-x.,,,,,,,,,

(1983) Nature (London) 305, 827-829. The regions of similarity extend over a small number of amino acids and require the introduction of gaps through the open reading frame. By using an octapeptide region as the sole criterion for ""taxonomic"" classification, we have grouped the oncoviruses into two distinct categories and the lentiviruses and hepadnaviruses into two additional groupings. This classification suggests that murine and feline leukemia viruses may be more closely related to the viruses that are associated with leukemia in primates and cattle than had been appreciated. We have exploited a portion of this region because of the minimal translational codon degeneracy of the conserved residues. Unique oligonucleotides from this region have been designed and used in the primer-directed in vitro DNA amplification of the hepadnaviruses as a model system. In addition, mixtures of oligonucleotides with various sequences but of the same length were demonstrated to be efficient primers. The amplification procedure enabled dramatic increases in sensitivity and coincident detection of mammalian and avian genomes. This approach will be a valuable tool to detect and characterize members of viral groups. In addition, since short stretches of similarity have been frequently identified in related but distinct genes, such an approach could prove a valuable asset to molecular studies in general.","['Mack, D H', 'Sninsky, J J']","['Mack DH', 'Sninsky JJ']","['Cetus Corporation, Department of Infectious Diseases, Emeryville, CA 94608.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Amplification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*classification/enzymology/genetics', 'Virology/*methods']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.18.6977 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Sep;85(18):6977-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.18.6977.,,,,,,PMC282102,,,

According to the immunological results, 25 cases were phenotyped as ALL and 15 cases as AML. Cases with blast crisis secondary to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-BC) were not represented in this series. In all ALL cases the two methods gave an identical antigenic distribution. In 20 our of 21 cases of non-T-cell ALL, a B-cell progenitor origin was demonstrated by a positive staining reaction with the anti-CD19 McAb AB1 or HD37, and in 10 cases additionally with the anti-CD20 McAb B1 or 1F5. In contrast to the results obtained with IF, IE revealed a poor preservation of the AB1 epitope on CD19, whereas the HD37 epitope was equally well demonstrated by both methods. In 15 cases of AML the distribution of positive versus negative cells with IE or IF was identical for all McAb except J5 (anti-CALLA) (CD10) and B1 (CD20). Thus, 10/15 AML cases expressed CALLA with IE compared to 2/15 with IF. The corresponding figures for B1 were 5/15 and 0/15, respectively. Accordingly, normal myeloid precursor cells were CALLA-positive with IE but negative with IF. The discrepancy probably reflects the fact that, whereas both intracytoplasmatic and membrane-bound antigens are exposed in IE, only the latter are in IF. If the alteration of antigenic accessibility after fixation is considered, IE can safely be used for immunophenotyping of acute leukemia.","['Ly, B', 'Beiske, K', 'Larsen, N']","['Ly B', 'Beiske K', 'Larsen N']","['Hematology Laboratory, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Staining and Labeling']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00884.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1988 Aug;41(2):147-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00884.x.,,,,,,,,,

Interferons exhibited modest antiproliferative effects against these lines with DNA synthesis inhibited greater than RNA greater than protein synthesis, as studied by 3H-precursor incorporation. The adenocarcinoma cell line was considerably more sensitive to recombinant gamma-than to purified alpha/beta-interferon, while HL-60 was slightly more sensitive, in short term studies, to antiproliferative effects of recombinant alpha- than to gamma-interferon. Interferon treatment was further associated with suppression of a hyperdiploid component of the adenocarcinoma cell line, as detected by flow cytometry. Combination treatment of the adenocarcinoma cell line with interferon and halogenated pyrimidines, under 4-day continuous exposure conditions, revealed significant synergy for growth inhibition with gamma- much greater than alpha/beta-interferon and with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine greater than 5-fluorouracil much greater than 5-fluorouridine. Thus, synergy was much greater with the more antiproliferative interferon and with the antimetabolite derivative most likely to lead to thymidylate synthetase inhibition rather than RNA incorporation. Sequential 2-day + 2-day treatment revealed greater synergy when interferon preceded 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorodeoxyuridine rather than the reverse protocol. The synergy of gamma-interferon and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine could be blocked by thymidine, which bypasses inhibition of thymidylate synthetase. HL-60 also exhibited thymidine antagonized synergistic growth-inhibitory effects of interferon and 5-fluorouracil. Analysis of this interaction by [3H]thymidine incorporation, which can reflect thymidylate synthase inhibition, revealed exaggerated responses of interferon-treated cells to either 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. These results indicate that interferon-halogenated pyrimidine antimetabolite synergistic interactions may be common to several cell types. Evidence is further presented for a mechanism of synergy entailing enhanced thymidylate synthetase inhibition by the antimetabolite of interferon-treated cells.","['Elias, L', 'Crissman, H A']","['Elias L', 'Crissman HA']","['Department of Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131.']",['eng'],['P41-RR01315/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Floxuridine/*pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Sep 1;48(17):4868-73.,,,,,,,,,

For a further elucidation of the antiviral effect of Avarol, we used NIH-3T3 cells infected with Mo-MuLV as a model system. The results show that in uninfected NIH-3T3 cells Avarol (i) causes a 50% reduction of the growth rate only at the high concentration of 29.6 microM and (ii) is accumulated in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus. At the much lower concentrations of 1-3 microM, Avarol causes an almost complete inhibition of viral progeny release. Moreover, it is shown that at 3 microM Avarol, the increase of the Mo-MuLV-induced UAG suppressor glutamine tRNA (tRNA(UmUGGln) was reduced to the normal level. Dot blot hybridization studies revealed that Avarol displays no inhibitory activity on cellular and viral mRNA synthesis. Taking the processing pathway of viral polyprotein Pr180gag,pol to p80 (reverse transcriptase) as an example, our Western blotting experiments showed that the final maturation process, conversion of p110 to p80, is inhibited in Avarol-treated cells. From these data we conclude that Avarol prevents the suppression of the UAG termination codon at the gag-pol junction of the retroviral genome. The functional consequence of this event is very likely an inhibition of the readthrough of the retroviral protease gene which overlaps the pol and gag genes, resulting in the reduction of the protease synthesis which is necessary for the viral proliferation.","['Kuchino, Y', 'Nishimura, S', 'Schroder, H C', 'Rottmann, M', 'Muller, W E']","['Kuchino Y', 'Nishimura S', 'Schroder HC', 'Rottmann M', 'Muller WE']","['Biophysics Division, National Cancer Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acid-Specific)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Gln)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'KZX416VN2B (avarol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acid-Specific/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Transfer, Gln/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/biosynthesis', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', '*Suppression, Genetic']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(88)90596-x [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1988 Aug;165(2):518-26. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(88)90596-x.,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not known if granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), macrophage-CSF (CSF-1) or other cytokines can induce NAP synthesis from the neutrophilic cells of CML patients.

Light density cells obtained from the blood of patients with chronic phase CML were depleted of T cells and monocytes. These cells were cultured with various amounts of G-CSF, GM-CSF, CSF-1, IL-1, IL-2, alpha-INF, r-INF, MoCM, GCT and TCM in a suspension culture system over 6-7 days. Evaluation of the cultures indicated that G-CSF, MoCM and GCT, but not the other factors or cytokines, consistently induced NAP synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Actinomycin-D and puromycin in separate cultures inhibited NAP synthesis without any significant reduction in cell counts. This indicated that NAP is not prepackaged in neutrophilic cells, and its synthesis occurs by a sequential transcription at the DNA level and translation at the ribosomal level.

Evidence that these basophils were dividing during culture included an increase in both the number of basophils and the histamine content of the cultures over time, as well as ultrastructural studies that demonstrated basophil cell division. The cells also had the capacity to be stimulated in an IgE-dependent manner characteristic of basophils. Cultured basophils passively sensitized with IgE underwent noncytotoxic degranulation after stimulation with specific antigen. Antigen-stimulated basophils released histamine, leukotrienes B4 and C4 and other 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism.

Each metastasis was also detected by four separate monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognize breast carcinoma associated antigens (DF3, anti-EMA, HMFG-2, and CAM5.2). These MAbs were then utilized to stain other bone marrow preparations (n = 81) to determine their utility for the detection of micrometastatic breast carcinoma. MAbs HMFG-2, anti-EMA, and DF3 were each strongly reactive with bone marrows containing histologically-evident metastatic breast carcinoma (18/18). These anti-epithelial membrane antigen MAbs, however, were also reactive with rare plasma cells and immature cells (as well as cell clusters) in some of the control bone marrow samples tested, including those from normal patients and patients with hematologic disorders. They also reacted with some of the preparations from patients with leukemia and lymphoma, and with uninvolved marrows from patients with non-epithelial malignancies. The anti-keratin MAb CAM5.2, in contrast, reacted with 83% (15/18) breast cancer metastases and failed to stain any cells in the various categories of control marrow preparations. These data suggested that MAb CAM5.2 might be utilized to immunohistochemically differentiate micrometastatic breast carcinoma from immature myeloid or erythroid elements. Each MAb was then reacted with histologically uninvolved marrow preparations from the remaining 24 of 30 breast cancer patients in an attempt to identify occult breast carcinoma metastases. While MAbs HMFG-2, DF3, and anti-EMA demonstrated reactive cells in some of these marrows, this reactivity was similar to that seen with control preparations. MAb CAM5.2, in contrast, was negative with all specimens. These data suggest that MAb CAM5.2 may be a useful immunologic probe for the detection and confirmation of metastatic breast carcinoma in bone marrow, while more caution must be employed in the interpretation of results obtained using MAbs anti-EMA, DF3, and HMFG-2.","['Thor, A', 'Viglione, M J', 'Ohuchi, N', 'Simpson, J', 'Steis, R', 'Cousar, J', 'Lippman, M', 'Kufe, D W', 'Schlom, J']","['Thor A', 'Viglione MJ', 'Ohuchi N', 'Simpson J', 'Steis R', 'Cousar J', 'Lippman M', 'Kufe DW', 'Schlom J']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, NCI, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', '*Breast Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/diagnosis/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Keratins/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01805837 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 1988 May;11(2):133-45. doi: 10.1007/BF01805837.,,,,,,,,,

Rearrangements of TCR-beta genes and functional 1.6 kb transcripts of TCR-alpha gene were demonstrated in each of the 7 T cell lines, but not in the 2 histiocytic cell lines. There often was incomplete transcription of TCR-beta chain and CD3-delta genes in postthymic T cell malignancies. At least 3 patterns could be defined: Pattern A, presence of TCR-beta and CD3-delta transcripts; Pattern B, presence of CD3-delta but lack of TCR-beta transcripts; and Pattern C, lack of both TCR-beta and CD3-delta transcripts. Expression of TCR-beta gene could be induced by phorbol ester in 3 cell lines from postthymic T cell malignancies, indicating that there was functional rearrangement of the TCR-beta gene. CD2 transcripts were detected in 1 cell line from T lymphoblastic and 1 postthymic activated T cell malignancy. No transcripts of TCR-beta, CD2, and CD3 genes were detected in the 2 malignant histiocytic cell lines. These studies demonstrate a molecular mechanism for the aberrant expression of T cell antigens in malignancies derived from postthymic activated T cells and indicate that the detection of TCR-alpha transcripts may be useful for recognizing anaplastic T cell malignancies and distinguishing them from those of true histiocytic origin.","['Su, I J', 'Balk, S P', 'Kadin, M E']","['Su IJ', 'Balk SP', 'Kadin ME']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['1-F05-TW03962-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Genes', 'Histiocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phenotype', 'RNA', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1988 Aug;132(2):192-8.,,,,,,PMC1880737,,,

The inability of combination chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT) to render patients disease free has led to radically divergent treatment approaches. Initial treatment may vary from aggressive combined modality therapy to no initial treatment. We sought to evaluate these two divergent approaches in a randomized trial of advanced indolent lymphomas (nodular, poorly differentiated lymphocytic; nodular mixed; diffuse, well-differentiated lymphocytic; diffuse, intermediately differentiated lymphocytic; and diffuse, poorly differentiated lymphocytic). A total of 104 patients were entered: 44 were randomly assigned to ""watch and wait"" in which only carefully defined, limited RT was administered if necessary; 45 were randomly assigned to aggressive combined modality treatment with prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, plus etoposide plus mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone (ProMACE-MOPP), followed by total nodal irradiation (TNI); and 15, with symptoms requiring initial therapy, received the identical combined treatment but were not randomly assigned. Of 41 evaluable patients on watch and wait, 23 (56%) have still not required systemic therapy, although 16 (39%) have received limited RT. Median time to crossover was 34 months. Of 18 patients crossed over, seven of the 16 who completed therapy (43%) achieved CR; two (11%) have relapsed. Histologic progression was seen in six (15%) of 41 patients on watch and wait without intervening chemotherapy. Of 45 patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy, 37 (82%) have completed induction therapy, and 29 of the 37 (78%) achieved CR. Twenty-five of those 29 patients (86%) are still in their first remission.

In certain situations this approach has revolutionized medical management, e.g. in immune thrombocytopenia. In other areas, such as in Kawasaki's syndrome, IVIG therapy have been shown to be highly beneficial in preventing long term disease sequelae by some investigators, but the field remains controversial.

Molecular analysis of ligand binding requisites for human B cell clonal expansion and tolerance.,247-66,"The ligand binding requisites for membrane IgM-mediated signaling of human B lymphocyte clonal expansion and B cell tolerance were investigated with a well-characterized set of soluble murine anti-human IgM mAbs. Evaluation of the impact of mu chain domain specificity, affinity, and binding stoichiometry for membrane IgM on antibody-induced regulation of normal and leukemic B cell DNA synthesis revealed that the ligand binding requisites for inducing or, alternatively, suppressing B cell DNA synthesis are significantly different. First, while the induction of S phase entry required micrograms/ml concentrations of ligand, orders of magnitude lower concentrations of ligand sufficed for inhibitory signaling. Second, while an upper affinity threshold for achieving maximal stimulation of B cell DNA synthesis was never detected, inhibitory signaling by bivalent ligands appeared to become relatively affinity independent at Fab binding affinities greater than 7.0 x 10(6) M-1. Third, while a C mu 1-specific mAb with an enhanced incidence of monogamous binding to mIgM was ineffective at inducing B cell DNA synthesis, the antibody was not significantly compromised in ability to initiate inhibitory signals. These differences could be observed in a clonal B cell population which positively or negatively responded to mIgM ligation depending upon its state of activation. The accumulated observations indicate that the ligand binding requisites for inhibitory signal transduction in human B lymphocytes are much less rigorous than those for stimulatory signal transduction and suggest that many physiologically relevant anti-Ig antibodies are more likely to function in the negative feedback regulation of B cell responses than in the direct triggering of human B cell clonal expansion.","['Rudich, S M', 'Roux, K H', 'Winchester, R J', 'Mongini, P K']","['Rudich SM', 'Roux KH', 'Winchester RJ', 'Mongini PK']","['Department of Rheumatic Diseases, Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York University Medical School, New York 10003.']",['eng'],"['AI-19411/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07180/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-35174/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitosis', 'Spleen/cytology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.168.1.247 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Jul 1;168(1):247-66. doi: 10.1084/jem.168.1.247.,,,,,,PMC2188966,,,

In addition, TES induced differentiation of the promyelocyte leukemic cell line HL-60 and stimulated growth of both granulocyte (CFU-G) and monocyte (CFU-M) colonies from murine bone marrow cells. Using anion exchange column chromatography, pluripotent CSF activities in TES were separated and shown to be distinct from an IL-1-like cytokine that has been shown as a TE cell-derived cytokine (TE-IL-1).

Responses to interferons are typically slow with improvement often taking several weeks to months. A wide range of both acute and chronic toxicities have been defined.

Reflecting the undetectable overlapping of the fluorescence spectra of protein and DNA, normal diploid cells in sputum revealed horizontal distributions along the 2C level on the dot-plot display of flow cytometry, which made sorting of abnormal hyperdiploid cells and cancer cells easier.","['Takahama, M', 'Kagaya, A']","['Takahama M', 'Kagaya A']","['Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proteins)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/analysis', 'DNA/*analysis', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Hematoporphyrins', 'Humans', '*Indoles', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sputum/analysis', 'Staining and Labeling']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/36.8.2455747 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1988 Aug;36(8):1061-7. doi: 10.1177/36.8.2455747.,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the kinetics of the differentiation process in suspension cultures, using growth curves and morphological markers to analyze proliferation and differentiation. At low cell densities (less than 10(5)/ml) neither ES nor G-CSF changed the rate of WEHI3B(D+) proliferation; nor did these reagents induce the differentiation of WEHI3B(D+). In contrast, AMD caused growth arrest and initiated cell maturation, which was followed by cell death. The time course of maturation depended on AMD concentration. The addition of either ES or G-CSF at the time of AMD exposure or at times up to 20 hr after the beginning of AMD exposure resulted in a delay of cell death for up to 3 days and in an accumulation of mature monocytes. The kinetics of AMD-induced maturation were not affected by the time of ES or G-CSF addition. We concluded that neither ES nor G-CSF induce the differentiation of WEHI3B(D+) cells directly, but that their presence permits the survival of mature cells produced from WEHI3B(D+) as a result of a short-range autocrine-induced differentiation.","['Bohmer, R M', 'Burgess, A W']","['Bohmer RM', 'Burgess AW']","['Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910420111 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Jul 15;42(1):53-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910420111.,,,,,,,,,

This cell line originates from a Rauscher virus (R-MuLV)-induced myeloid leukemia and forms tumors when re-inoculated into mice. MAbs were characterized as regards their reactivity against virally and non-virally induced cell lines. Two selected MAbs, IC5F5 and 4D2B4, were analyzed further. Their binding to subcellular structures was determined, and so were the properties of the antigens to which they are directed. MAb IC5F5 is of the IgG2A and 4D2B4 of the IgG2b subclass. Both bind to R-MuLV-infected or -transformed cell lines and are not mutually competitive. The antibodies do not react with other murine and human myeloid leukemic cells. As shown by immuno-electron microscopy, these MAbs have affinity to the cell membrane of non-virus producing RMB-I cells. When lysates of purified virus were analyzed, the MAbs were found to be directed to the gag precursor protein Pr65, and one of them (IC5F5) also to be directed to the core protein p12. In RMB-I cells, binding occurs to a 50-kDa glycoprotein and 2 proteins of 26 and 29 kDa.

These characteristics were studied to select for IFN-resistant cell variants. Some 0.6% of the parental S49 cell population were resistant to the antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of IFN. The resistant cells were cloned and analyzed for their responses to several of the activities of IFN, namely, inhibition of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus, murine leukemia virus (MuLV) replications, and the induction of (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase. Among the clones selected some were highly resistant while others demonstrated only partial responsiveness to IFN. S49 cells demonstrate tubular structures in the cytoplasm. These structures were previously reported to be antigenically related to mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We report here that IFN treatment decreases the expression of these cytoplasmic viral structures as revealed by electron microscopy. To correlate this novel antiviral activity to the more established functions of IFN we utilized the above mentioned S49 IFN-resistant variants. The anti-MMTV activity of IFN correlated with the other effects of IFN in both the highly resistant and partially responsive S49 clones. Our findings indicate that a relatively high proportion of S49 cells vary in their response to IFN. The defect in the resistant cells appears to affect a primary response to IFN which is common to its diverse activities. Furthermore, the effect of IFN on MMTV-related structures involves the usual pathway of IFN action.","['Hochman, J', 'Mador, N', 'Gloger, I', 'Falk, H', 'Panet, A']","['Hochman J', 'Mador N', 'Gloger I', 'Falk H', 'Panet A']","['Department of Zoology, Hadassah Medical School, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/biosynthesis"", 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytoplasm/microbiology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/physiology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Lymphoma/microbiology/*pathology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(88)90023-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(88)90023-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1988 Jul;177(1):37-46. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(88)90023-7.,,,,,,,,,

This occurs in the face of major increases in tyrosine kinase and protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase activities (D. A. Frank and A. C. Sartorelli, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 140: 440-447, 1986). In the present work, these two activities were characterized in the particulate fraction of HL-60 cells, since both enzymes are membrane bound. The tyrosine kinase activity utilized ATP as a phosphate donor, although GTP and other nucleotides were competitive with ATP. The enzyme was temperature sensitive, had a pH optimum of 6.5, and required Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity, with additional stimulation of activity being produced by Zn2+. Agents such as epidermal growth factor and insulin, which stimulate other tyrosine kinase enzymes, were without effect on the tyrosine kinase activity of HL-60 cells. Enzyme activity was stimulated, however, by non-ionic detergents and was inhibited by quercetin. The protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity was paralleled by that of p-nitrophenyl phosphatase, was inhibited by VO3-4, Zn2+ and F-, and was maximally active at a pH of 7 to 8. The characteristics of the tyrosine kinase and the protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase activities were distinct from those of other known proteins of these classes. Tyrosine kinase activity was predominantly located on the plasma membrane, while the protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity was concentrated on internal membranes. The activities of both enzymes present on the plasma membrane appeared to exist on the cytoplasmic face of this membrane. Further characterization of the activities of these enzyme systems and their contribution to the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation would appear to be important to an understanding of the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation.","['Frank, D A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Frank DA', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Polymers)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '31325-29-8 (GAT)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Polymers', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Aug 1;48(15):4299-306.,,,,,,,,,

The cells became weakly adherent, developed conspicuous cytoplasmic blebs, and displayed mature megakaryocytic characteristics by light microscopy such as the development of azurophilic cytoplasmic granules and a mosaic pattern of oxyphilic patches, multiplication of nuclei, and enhancement of the PAS reaction and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated the development of prominent cytoplasmic blebs, budding of blebs, and multiplication of nuclei. Numerous granules with central nucleoids that are similar to alpha granules had developed as well as granules with high electron density and clearly demarcated zones. Surface marker analysis revealed a moderate increase in IgG Fc receptor levels and a profound decrease in C3 receptor sites. By an immunofluorescent technique using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, a dramatic change in the expression of several megakaryocyte-platelet-specific proteins was demonstrated. All the proteins that had been expressed before induction such as platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor XIIIA, beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), and HLA class 1 antigen were profoundly enhanced after induction by TPA. Induction by TPA led to the expression of fibronectin and factor V, which were not detected on nontreated cells. An ultrastructural immunoperoxidase study demonstrated platelet GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa in both plasma membranes and protein synthesis areas such as perinuclear cisternae and endoplasmic reticulum after TPA induction. beta-TG was also observed in some cytoplasmic granules of TPA-treated cells. TPA remarkably increased the secretion of beta-TG into the culture medium of MEG-01s. Ploidy was also increased from 2C to 4C to 4C to 8C. Similar maturation of MEG-01s was induced by other phorbol diester analogues such as phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, but not by phorbol itself. These results indicate that phorbol diester, TPA, can bring about differentiation and maturation of a human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01s) and that MEG-01s cells will provide a useful model for studying megakaryocytic differentiation and numerous megakaryocyte-platelet-specific proteins.","['Ogura, M', 'Morishima, Y', 'Okumura, M', 'Hotta, T', 'Takamoto, S', 'Ohno, R', 'Hirabayashi, N', 'Nagura, H', 'Saito, H']","['Ogura M', 'Morishima Y', 'Okumura M', 'Hotta T', 'Takamoto S', 'Ohno R', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Nagura H', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Polyploidy', 'Rosette Formation', 'Staining and Labeling', 'beta-Thromboglobulin/metabolism']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80550-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):49-60.,,,,,,,,,

All acute promyelocytic leukemias with the specific chromosomal translocation t(15;17) and one case of myelomonocytic leukemia with balanced chromosomal translocation involving chromosome 17 at band q12q21 were induced to proliferate strongly by the G-CSF. However, contrary to the long-term proliferative effect observed with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF activity can be characterized by its capability to initiate and promote the growth of responding AML cells but not to sustain long-term proliferation. Finally, no terminal differentiation was found, as assessed by morphology, cytochemistry, and cell surface marker analysis. These results indicate that G-CSF may be sufficient to provide a specific signal for induction of a transient proliferation in AML without induction of terminal differentiation.

CP/CPK or aspirin alone reduced fibrinogen binding to 20% to 30%; however, this binding was sufficient to support full platelet aggregation. Combined treatment with CP/CPK and aspirin abolished fibrinogen binding and aggregation. These results demonstrate that the binding of IgG molecules to the CD9 antigen exposes fibrinogen receptors through both secreted ADP and thromboxane and that either one of both can expose the receptors to an extent sufficient to aggregate platelets.","['Hato, T', 'Ikeda, K', 'Yasukawa, M', 'Watanabe, A', 'Kobayashi, Y']","['Hato T', 'Ikeda K', 'Yasukawa M', 'Watanabe A', 'Kobayashi Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Ehime University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Cd9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', '020IUV4N33 (Phosphocreatine)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Aspirin/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Blood Platelets/immunology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphocreatine/pharmacology', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Thromboxane B2/biosynthesis']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80577-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):224-9.,,,,,,,,,

Vitronectin is normally present in plasma at a concentration of approximately 300 micrograms/mL. The investigators quantified plasma vitronectin with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and visualized reduced and nonreduced vitronectin by immunoblotting after separation of plasma or serum by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The concentration of plasma vitronectin was markedly reduced in some patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, especially in those with liver failure; it was near normal in patients with metastatic cancer and acute leukemia. Patients with vitronectin levels less than 40% normal invariably had low fibrinogen and antithrombin III and a prolonged prothrombin time. In both normal and patient plasmas there was heterogeneity in the ratio of the 75,000- and 65,000-mol wt polypeptides of reduced vitronectin: 18% had mostly the 75,000-mol wt polypeptide, 59% had roughly equal amounts of the two polypeptides, and 22% had mostly the 65,000-mol wt polypeptide. This polymorphism is inherited and appears to be due to two alleles that are present with approximately equal frequency. The blotting patterns of vitronectin in reduced and nonreduced plasmas were largely unaltered in plasma of patients with defibrination syndrome, fibrinolysis, liver failure, sepsis, metastatic cancer, and acute leukemia. There was no evidence of fragmentation of vitronectin or formation of the disulfide-bonded complex of vitronectin and thrombin-antithrombin III that is found when blood is clotted. Thus these results corroborate in vitro observations that the liver is the major source of plasma vitronectin, suggest that vitronectin may become depleted during disseminated intravascular coagulation, and define a genetic polymorphism of vitronectin.","['Conlan, M G', 'Tomasini, B R', 'Schultz, R L', 'Mosher, D F']","['Conlan MG', 'Tomasini BR', 'Schultz RL', 'Mosher DF']","['Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],['HL29865/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9004-70-0 (Collodion)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antithrombin III/analysis', 'Collodion', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*blood/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Liver Diseases/blood/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Vitronectin']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80570-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):185-90.,,,,,,,,,

By coculturing different allogeneic combinations of B-CLL cells and T cells and by adding anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody to cultures, it was found that antigen presentation by B-CLL cells was restricted by HLA-DR in the same way as for macrophages.

Incubations with concentrations of methotrexate (0.02 and 0.2 microM), which can be maintained during many hours in the oral maintenance therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, indicated large differences between the three cell lines with respect to the inhibition of PDNS, depending on the concentration of methotrexate (MTX) and on the activities of the two pathways. These dose- and cell line-dependent differences corresponded to the perturbations of cell-kinetics and purine and pyrimidine (deoxy)ribonucleotide pools in the three cell lines. Exposure of MOLT-4 cells to 0.02 microM MTX resulted in an incomplete inhibition of DNA synthesis in early S phase, as shown by DNA-flow cytometry and increase of dCTP levels, which recovered spontaneously after 48 hr. Almost no impairment of RNA synthesis occurred (unbalanced growth). In RAJI cells, exposed to 0.02 microM MTX, DNA synthesis was delayed in the S phase, not arrested, and RNA synthesis was not impaired, also indicating an unbalanced growth pattern, which, however, did not recover in time. KM-3 cells were arrested in G1 phase and subsequently in early S phase after incubation with 0.02 microM MTX, and perturbations of ribonucleotides indicated a complete inhibition of RNA synthesis, resulting in a balanced growth pattern. Cytotoxicity was more pronounced in KM-3 cells. The reliability of the soft agar colony forming assay after low dose MTX treatment is discussed. Exposure of MOLT-4 and KM-3 cells to 0.2 microM MTX resulted in a complete inhibition of DNA synthesis, with cessation of cell progression through all parts of the cell cycle and arrest in G1 phase. RAJI cells showed an increasing accumulation of cells in G1 phase without complete cessation of cell cycle progression.

Normal bone marrow cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes lack this capacity. The increased levels of PRPP can be used for enhanced incorporation of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), indicating a potential time-, sequence- and dose-dependent synergism of both drugs. The effects of 0.02 microM and 0.2 microM MTX on the PDNS of MOLT-4 (T-), RAJI (B-) and KM-3 (non-B-non-T-) human malignant lymphoblasts were studied with respect to PRPP levels, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleosidemonophosphate (AICAR) levels and the incorporation of labeled glycine into purine metabolites. These results were correlated with the activity of the PDNS (labeled glycine incorporation) and the purine salvage pathway (labeled hypoxanthine incorporation) in untreated cells. Inhibition of PDNS by 0.02 microM MTX was complete in KM-3 cells with a moderately active PDNS and salvage pathway. RAJI cells, with a relatively low PDNS and high salvage pathway, demonstrated an incomplete, but increasing inhibition of PDNS, whereas inhibition of PDNS in MOLT-4 cells with both pathways active was minimal and recovered in time. Treatment with 0.2 microM MTX resulted in a complete inhibition of PDNS in all cell lines. After treatment with MTX an enhanced incorporation of labeled hypoxanthine and 6MP was noticed, confirming the potential rescue from MTX cytotoxicity by hypoxanthine and a potential synergism of MTX and 6MP on cytotoxicity. The enhanced incorporation of 6MP was more obvious in RAJI and KM-3 cells in comparison with MOLT-4 cells.

In this study it was found that nonproliferating B cells did not incorporate 32PO4 into B1 although phosphorylated class I histocompatibility molecules were easily detected. In contrast B1 isolated from proliferating or malignant B cells or B cell lines was heavily phosphorylated. Cross-linking B1 on the cell surface by antibody resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of B1 as did exposure to phorbol esters, and the membrane permeable diacylglycerol analog 1,2,-dioctanoylglyceron. B1(33) and B1(35) produced identical peptide maps following limited proteinase digestion. However, B1(35) contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, while B1(33) only contained phosphoserine. In addition alkaline phosphatase was able to remove the phosphate residue(s) that resulted in generation of the B1(35) form of B1 but was unable to remove the phosphorylation of B1(33). These results suggest that phosphorylation of B1 molecules is associated with proliferation and that the different Mr forms of B1 result from the phosphorylation of B1 at different sites. Also, the finding that antibody binding to B1 generated a transmembrane signal may explain why antibody binding to B1 alters B cell function.","['Tedder, T F', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Tedder TF', 'Schlossman SF']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['CA-19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies/physiology', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)81618-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Jul 15;263(20):10009-15.,,,,,,,,,

The influence of in vivo stimulation by allogenic leukocytes and the influence of renal allografts or cytomegalovirus infection on serum beta-2 microglobulin and IFN-gamma levels were also studied. Increased beta-2 microglobulin concentrations were observed again in each of these clinical situations and were closely associated with enhanced endogenous interferon production.

This deficiency is correlated with the presence of more breaks in the DNA from these kinds of leukemia which results in altered DNA. This DNA can be ligated by the addition of exogenous ligase. This is the first demonstration of a ligase deficiency in leukemic human cells.

We have observed in HL60 cells maintained in culture over long periods of time such phenomena as emergence of drug resistance, oncogene amplification, loss of granulocyte and monocyte lineage markers, and alteration in cell growth parameters. As summarized in this report, a comprehensive review of the literature on HL60 cells shows a wide diversity of phenotype for these cells. We have developed and acquired from other laboratories a series of HL60 sublines with varying phenotypic characteristics. The time in continuous log phase culture for HL60 cells (passage 13 ATCC, Rockville MD) to undergo phenotypic drift from a heavily granulated promyelocytic cell to a more undifferentiated agranular blast form on four occasions varied from 3 to 18 months. The actual loss of promyelocytic phenotype occurred rapidly (within less than 1 month) following a variable period of apparent stable phenotype, The change in morphology was invariably accompanied by decreased sensitivity to ARA-c (5- to 20-fold increase in LD50 and dose necessary to induce NSE positive cells). The c-myc gene is variably amplified in sublines of HL60 cells. The expression of c-myc primarily reflects alterations in cell cycle kinetics and was not found to be correlated with a switch between proliferation and maturation. These results suggest that phenotypic drift may be due to loss of response to regulatory signals that affect the expression of a number of cellular genes.","['Leglise, M C', 'Dent, G A', 'Ayscue, L H', 'Ross, D W']","['Leglise MC', 'Dent GA', 'Ayscue LH', 'Ross DW']","['Department of Pathology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27514.']",['eng'],['K08HL01922-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1988;13(3):319-37.,96,,,,,,,,

At the early stages of cell culture, RCMC1 expressed predominantly Fc epsilon RI and a gradual increase in the expression of Fc epsilon RII has been observed with time in culture. By comparison, RCMC2 expressed predominantly Fc epsilon RII throughout its entire period of cell culture.","['Chan, B M', 'McNeill, K', 'Froese, A']","['Chan BM', 'McNeill K', 'Froese A']","['Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Histamine/analysis', 'Mast Cells/analysis/*cytology/drug effects', 'Peptide Hydrolases/analysis', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Staining and Labeling']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(88)90067-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(88)90067-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1988 May;18(1):37-42. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(88)90067-3.,,,,['Immunol Lett 1988 Aug;18(4):307'],,,,,

A small minority of patients need no treatment and have a long survival. We continue to recommend splenectomy as the initial therapy in patients with cytopenias or splenic complications; however, the initial management of leukemic patients is less well defined because splenectomy will not decrease the WBC and frequently will exacerbate the hyperleukocytosis. This group of patients might benefit from initial IFN therapy, although this has not been established in studies to date. Management of patients with advanced disease postsplenectomy is less controversial at this time. IFN has been demonstrated to be a safe, highly effective palliative treatment by multiple investigators. Chemotherapy should be avoided in patients with pancytopenia, although it may be used as part of an overall treatment plan in conjunction with IFN. Further trials are indicated to determine whether late intensification or ""adjuvant"" chemotherapy will be advantageous in partial and complete responders to IFN therapy. With multiple treatment strategies and careful attention to developing complications, survival in patients with hairy cell leukemia should continue to improve for newly diagnosed patients. Based on the use of some of these strategies in 199 patients that we have identified since 1974, we can show that the survival is good and that the median actuarial survival has not yet been reached (Fig. 15-4).","['Golomb, H M', 'Ratain, M J', 'Vardiman, J W']","['Golomb HM', 'Ratain MJ', 'Vardiman JW']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Important Adv Oncol,Important advances in oncology,8505229,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Important Adv Oncol. 1986:311-21.,41,,,,,,,,

Exposure of HL-60 cells to 1 mM HU enhanced the accumulation of Ara-CTP up to 2.5-fold, whereas HU did not have significant effects on Ara-C metabolism in CEM cells. In addition, two adenine nucleosides, deoxyadenosine (dAdo) and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (Ara-A), which are known to be activated by deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase as Ara-C, were more effectively phosphorylated after the addition of HU only in HL-60 cells. However, the changes of intracellular dCTP and TTP pools induced by HU, i.e. decrease in dCTP and increase in TTP, were the same in both cell lines. Finally, dCyd production under normal culture conditions was at least 3- to 4-fold higher in HL-60 cells and was inhibited significantly by HU administration. These results suggest that the modulation of Ara-C metabolism by HU occurs at the level of dCyd kinase through the regulation of de novo dCyd generation.","['Kubota, M', 'Takimoto, T', 'Tanizawa, A', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Mikawa, H']","['Kubota M', 'Takimoto T', 'Tanizawa A', 'Akiyama Y', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '3714-60-1 (ara-ATP)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Arabinonucleotides/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(88)90438-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(88)90438-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1988 May 1;37(9):1745-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90438-8.,,,,,,,,,

Blast stem cells grow in culture usually when stimulated by growth factors normally active on myelopoietic cells. Two culture methods permit an evaluation of the balance between self-renewal and differentiation; previous studies have shown that this balance can be affected by recombinant growth factors. These include interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), active on early cells in normal myelopoiesis, and G-CSF and CSF-1, restricted in normal hemopoiesis to the granulopoietic and macrophage/monocytic lineages, respectively. In this paper we report the results of evaluating the effects on these recombinant growth factors alone or in mixtures of two at optimal concentrations. The results were obtained either using titrations of colony formation in methylcellulose or growth in suspension. Star diagrams, a technique from exploratory data analysis, were used to provide quantitative and graphic displays of the results of the recombinant factors on the balance between blast self-renewal and differentiation. Blasts from 4 acute myeloblastic leukemia patients and one patient with the blast crisis of chronic myeloblastic leukemia were examined in detail. The great patient-to-patient variation usually observed was seen in both plating efficiency in methylcellulose and growth pattern in suspension. In spite of this variation, a common pattern of response to growth factors emerged. When the early acting factors, IL-3 and GM-CSF, were combined, the effect was quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the largest stimulation seen with either of the factors alone. In contrast, late-acting factors, G-CSF and CSF-1, influenced each other's effects when present together and each affected the activities of GM-CSF and IL-3. Notably, CSF-1, which often led to the accumulation of adherent, terminal cells in suspension, usually maintained or increased this differentiation-like activity in combination. G-CSF also favored differentiation in combination, although the effect was usually to increase the number of colonies in methylcellulose, most of which consist of blast cells incapable of further divisions. The results are discussed as they relate to the postulated structure of the blast population and the normal targets of the recombinant growth factors.","['Miyauchi, J', 'Kelleher, C A', 'Wong, G G', 'Yang, Y C', 'Clark, S C', 'Minkin, S', 'Minden, M D', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Miyauchi J', 'Kelleher CA', 'Wong GG', 'Yang YC', 'Clark SC', 'Minkin S', 'Minden MD', 'McCulloch EA']","['The Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jun;2(6):382-7.,,,,,,,,,

Morphology varies from clone to clone and is distinct from that of F9 and other EC cells. In agreement with previous findings in in vivo embryos, expression of surface MHC class I antigen in 57 new clones is either undetectable or low (with variability). All of the clones respond to the addition of interferons and express MHC class I antigens at high levels, but the kinetics of mRNA accumulation vary considerably. To examine the basis of the generally low or absent MHC class I gene expression in these cells, we tested promoter activity of a MHC class I gene by CAT assay after transient DNA transfection. Regardless of the basal levels of mRNA or surface Ag, CAT activity directed by various portions of the 5' flanking region of the MHC class I gene was uniformly low. The cells showed neither the negative nor the positive regulation of MHC class I genes that had been noted respectively for EC cells and for cells expressing the Ag constitutively.

Single parameter flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that cells reactive with alpha-neo-CRP exhibited a bimodal staining pattern based on fluorescence intensity: high intensity neo-CRPbright and low intensity neo-CRPdim. Two-color analysis revealed that neo-CRPbright cells co-expressed CD19, CD20, and HLA-DR, whereas neo-CRPdim cells co-expressed CD16, CD11b, Leu-7, and Leu-19. Anti-neo-CRP also reacted with PBL obtained from patients with CD16+ lymphoproliferative disorders and from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B cell origin, but not with cells from patients with T cell or myeloid leukemias. The alpha-neo-CRP cells from patients with NK cell expansions showed dim fluorescence, whereas patients with B cell expansions showed bright fluorescence, consistent with the staining patterns observed with normal PBL. In addition, cell lines of T cell, B cell, NK cell, myeloid, and erythroid origin were evaluated for reactivity with alpha-neo-CRP. The cloned NK cell line NK 3.3 reacted as neo-CRPdim, but the B cell lines BL41, BL41/95, T1, T2, and CESS all reacted as neo-CRPbright. The cell lines K562, Molt-4, Hut-78, HL-60, U-937, and THP-1-0, which lack characteristic NK and B cell markers, did not react with alpha-neo-CRP. Additional study of the two-color histograms revealed a distinct diagonal staining pattern that was observed only when cells were co-stained with alpha-neo-CRP and either alpha-CD16 (alpha-Fc gamma RIII) or antibody IV3 (alpha-CDw32; alpha-Fc gamma RII). This finding suggests a 1:1 relationship between Fc gamma R on both NK and B cells and determinants recognized by alpha-neo-CRP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Bray, R A', 'Samberg, N L', 'Gewurz, H', 'Potempa, L A', 'Landay, A L']","['Bray RA', 'Samberg NL', 'Gewurz H', 'Potempa LA', 'Landay AL']","['Department of Immunology/Microbiology, Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL 60612.']",['eng'],['P60-AR30692/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology', 'C-Reactive Protein/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology', 'Phenotype']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Jun 15;140(12):4271-8.,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, one of the lines, RPMI 8226, while positive for J5, appeared to be negative when labeled with BA-3, except for a slight displacement of the fluorescence distribution relative to the control. A possible explanation for the observed results is that the BA-3 binding epitope or epitopes on CALLA may vary in their number and/or accessibility to the antibody.

Previous studies have suggested that some AML cells can produce their own CSFs, but the frequency of this phenomenon is unclear. In this study, Northern blot hybridization was used to detect mRNA transcripts for granulocyte-monocyte CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), and macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) in 22 randomly selected cases of AML. Ten cases expressed one CSF transcript (generally M-CSF), one case expressed two CSF transcripts, and six cases expressed all three. The expression of CSF transcripts did not significantly correlate with the French-American-British classification, with the possible exception that four of the five cases expressing all three CSF mRNAs were FAB M1. Six cases had autonomous growth of clonogenic cells in agar, and all six cases expressed one or more type of CSF transcript. None of the five evaluated cases lacking all three CSF transcripts had autonomous growth. However, there were many cases in which CSF transcripts were present and no autonomous growth was observed. In response to exogenously added human recombinant CSFs, 11 of 18 cases proliferated in response to GM-CSF, 8 of 18 cases in response to G-CSF, and 0 of 10 cases in response to M-CSF. Response to a CSF was not significantly correlated with the presence or absence of CSF transcripts, particularly for M-CSF. These results show that CSF transcripts are frequently detected in AML, although with a substantial degree of heterogeneity. It is possible that CSF production contributes to unregulated growth in some cases of AML.","['Young, D C', 'Demetri, G D', 'Ernst, T J', 'Cannistra, S A', 'Griffin, J D']","['Young DC', 'Demetri GD', 'Ernst TJ', 'Cannistra SA', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['CA19389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1988 Jun;16(5):378-82.,,,,,,,,,

At low concentration ranges (1-25 microM) this compound was found to strongly inhibit polymerase alpha and ligase from leukemic cells while being less effective on the enzyme activity from normal thymocytes and lymphocytes. At the DNA level, low concentrations of peplomycin resulted in the induction of dose-dependent single-stranded breaks. The incubation of peplomycin (5 microM) with plasmid DNA resulted in its degradation as observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Lowering the peplomycin concentration showed that ligase inhibition takes place prior to this phenomenon. The decreased formation of the ligase--adenylate complex under the effect of peplomycin is consistent with a direct interaction between the drug and the enzyme.

The release of histamine, but not of lactate dehydrogenase, was totally dependent on external calcium and this release probably represented an exocytotic response of the cells to cardiotoxin. Although, initially, treatment with the toxin did not impair antigen-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids or prevent the antigen-induced rise in the concentration of cytosol Ca2+, prolonged exposure to the toxin did result in a progressive loss of responsiveness of RBL-2H3 cells to antigen.","['Lo, T N', 'Eng, S P', 'Jaseph, L A', 'Beaven, M A', 'Lo, C S']","['Lo TN', 'Eng SP', 'Jaseph LA', 'Beaven MA', 'Lo CS']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.67 (1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase', 'Animals', 'Basophils', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Dogs', 'Elapid Venoms/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Kidney', '*Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",1988/06/08 00:00,1988/06/08 00:01,['1988/06/08 00:00'],"['1988/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(88)90221-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(88)90221-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Jun 8;970(1):51-60. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(88)90221-2.,,,,,,,,,

The fatal outcome of this blood disease can only be checked if we possess one or several treatments providing a complete and stable clinical, haematological and cytogenetic remission. Such a course is seldom observed. The conventional treatment of the chronic phase consists of single drug chemotherapeutic regimens which have succeeded in increasing the patients' median survival but do not prevent blastic transformation which is beyond therapeutic resources. In some cases multiple drug chemotherapy, and notably bone marrow transplantation, may result in disappearance of the Philadelphia chromosome and arrest of the natural course of the disease. Interferon is a new treatment which eradicates the Philadelphia chromosome and offers hopes of complete and prolonged, if not permanent, remissions. The present experience, although limited, suggests that alpha-interferons are effective.

A continuous open reading frame encoding all 788 amino acids for GPIIIa was present. The deduced amino acid sequence included a 26-residue amino-terminal signal peptide, a 29-residue transmembrane domain near the carboxy terminus, and four tandemly repeated cysteine-rich domains of 33-38 residues. An exact correspondence of 128 amino acids from seven human platelet GPIIIa fragments with HEL GPIIIa indicates that HEL and platelet GPIIIa are the same gene product. The HEL GPIIIa sequence was compared with the sequences of the beta subunit for the human LFA-1/Mac-1/p150.95 complex and human endothelial cell GPIIIa, revealing a 38% similarity with the former and virtual identity with the latter. Northern blot analysis using RNA from both HEL and endothelial cells revealed two GPIIIa transcripts of 5.9 and 4.1 kb. However, HEL RNA, but not endothelial cell RNA, contained a transcript for GPIIb.

Only the centroblastic lymphomas (in 17%) showed occasional follicular growth pattern, which further confirms the view that they are derived from germinal centre cells.","['Hui, P K', 'Feller, A C', 'Lennert, K']","['Hui PK', 'Feller AC', 'Lennert K']","['Institute of Pathology, Christian-Albrecht University, Kiel, West Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,['0 (Plastics)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Biopsy', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/pathology', 'Plastics', 'Staining and Labeling']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1988.tb01924.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1988 Feb;12(2):127-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1988.tb01924.x.,,,,,,,,,

A small proportion of such patients develop secondary malignancy. We examined the possibility that those patients who develop secondary malignancy have low endogenous levels of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) activity and are therefore more sensitive to the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of their treatment. We assayed AGT activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with HD, NHL, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) de novo, and therapy-related ANLL, as well as a group of normal control subjects. Studies in normal controls showed that at least over a short term of 1 week, individuals have characteristic AGT levels, although some individuals sampled repeatedly over several months showed high variation. Mean AGT activities +/- SE for the various groups studied were (fmol/micrograms of DNA): normal control group, 7.05 +/- 0.36; HD and NHL patients (prior to treatment), 4.97 +/- 0.42; HD-NHL patients receiving procarbazine, 3.88 +/- 0.44; ANLL de novo, 7.78 +/- 1.72; and therapy-related ANLL, 4.30 +/- 0.58.

The data presented here extend previous findings of sequence homology among the genomes of the members of these virus families. HBV was found to possess sequences homologous to the retrovirus protease and reverse transcriptase gene sequences. Homology was not found to the retrovirus integrase sequence consistent with the observation that hepadnaviruses do not integrate into cellular DNA as a necessary step in their replication cycle. Overall, the homology of the hepadnavirus polymerase gene was strongest with that of the murine leukemia viruses (MLVs). Also, the hepadnavirus polymerase shares organizational similarities to the MLV polymerase sequence. Analysis suggests that the ancestor of both hepadnaviruses and retroviruses possessed an overlapping long open reading frame in the polymerase gene sequence. In addition, low stringency blot hybridization using hepadnavirus DNA probes indicates that HBV is more closely related to MLV sequences than the sequences of MLV-related viruses and endogenous retrovirus-like genetic elements. Taken together, the data indicate that the polymerase gene sequence of the hepadnavirus and MLV genomes are organized in a similar fashion which suggests that these viruses evolved from a common ancestor.","['Miller, R H']",['Miller RH'],"['Hepatitis Viruses Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['U41-01685-05/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', '*Genes, Viral', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(88)90630-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1988 May;164(1):147-55. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(88)90630-7.,,,,,,,,,

Calcium release from intracellular storage sites was monitored with fura-2, a fluorescent indicator. The dependence of the rate of calcium release on the concentration of added IP3 in the 4 to 40 nM range showed that channel opening requires the binding of at least three molecules of IP3. Channel opening occurred in the absence of added adenosine triphosphate, indicating that IP3 acts directly on the channel or on a protein that gates it. The channels were opened by IP3 in less than 4 seconds. The highly cooperative opening of calcium channels by nanomolar concentrations of IP3 enables cells to detect and amplify very small changes in the concentration of this messenger in response to hormonal, sensory, and growth control stimuli.","['Meyer, T', 'Holowka, D', 'Stryer, L']","['Meyer T', 'Holowka D', 'Stryer L']","['Department of Cell Biology, Sherman Fairchild Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM24032/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM30387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils', 'Benzofurans', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sugar Phosphates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/04/29 00:00,1988/04/29 00:01,['1988/04/29 00:00'],"['1988/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2452482 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1988 Apr 29;240(4852):653-6. doi: 10.1126/science.2452482.,,,,,,,,,

Addition of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) but not granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, granulocyte-CSF, or multi-CSF reduced the LIF-induced suppression of colony numbers and size. G-CSF had a slower differentiation-inducing action on M1 cells than LIF but potentiated the differentiation-inducing effects of low concentrations of LIF. LIF had no colony-stimulating activity for normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells and did not alter their quantitative responsiveness to CSF. However, culture of normal progenitor cells in the presence of LIF, but initial absence of CSF, reduced the survival of these cells.

This cell line was able to form colonies in response to each hemopoietic factor, but colony formation was rarely seen in their absence. Some populations of NFS-60 cells could differentiate into neutrophils and macrophages in the presence of IL-3 and GM-CSF. Moreover, in the presence of Ep, this cell line formed well-hemoglobinized colonies as well as nonerythroid colonies. In the presence of G-CSF, NFS-60 cells remained in the promyelocytic state. Electron microscopic studies confirmed these morphologies. A single-cell transfer experiment demonstrated that neutrophils, macrophages, and erythroblasts were derived from a single cell.

Thus, we have developed an alternative, faster sorting technique: photodamage cell sorting. In a photodamage cell sorter all unwanted cells, as detected with the first, measuring laser, are killed with the second, damaging laser. Thus, the cells need to be photosensitive to the second laser. In addition, a mechanism is needed to switch this laser on and off based on the sorting criteria. In our photodamage cell sorter, the ZAPPER, we use an acousto-optic crystal to switch the laser beam. Cells are made photosensitive by vital staining with photosensitizers. With cells grown in the presence of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and stained with Hoechst 33342 (H42) at least a 5-decade cell reduction is accomplished after irradiation with 400 mW UV light. With this system, sorting rates have been achieved of 30,000 cells per second. Due to the selection based on photodynamic killing, this sorting technique is restricted to the selection of viable cells. Photodamage cell sorting seems well suited for isolating viable cells occurring in low percentages or for the sorting of large numbers of cells. Another application can be the sorting of large or fragile cells.","['Herweijer, H', 'Stokdijk, W', 'Visser, J W']","['Herweijer H', 'Stokdijk W', 'Visser JW']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,['G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation', '*Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lasers/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990090208 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1988 Mar;9(2):143-9. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990090208.,,,,,,,,,

The half-life for melphalan was similar to the terminal half-life of the drug in vivo. The effect of the two metabolites, MOH and M(OH)2, on the chemosensitivity of K562 leukaemia cells during continuous exposure to melphalan was also examined. M(OH)2 had no potentiating effect on melphalan cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 100 micrograms/ml. MOH also had little effect on cell kill at concentrations higher than those commonly achieved during in vitro chemosensitivity assays. The LD50 for 1 h exposure to melphalan was twice that for continuous exposure: this also suggests no interference by MOH and M(OH)2.

Cocapping studies and immunoprecipitation experiments performed with GA3 and L10, an anti-sialophorin monoclonal antibody reacting with leukosialin (Gp 105) on K562 cells, demonstrate that the antigen detected by GA3 on K562 cells is identical to leukosialin. Neuraminidase treatment but not tunicamycin treatment of K562 cells abolishes the expression of the GA3-epitope without affecting the L10-epitope thus providing evidence that terminal sialic acid present on O-linked oligosaccharide chains on Gp 105 is essential for the expression of the GA3-epitope. Further analysis by flow cytometry and immune panning experiments performed on bone marrow cells with GA3 or L10 demonstrate that, in contrast to L10, which reacts with all types of hematopoietic progenitors, the epitope recognized by GA3 is restricted to the erythroid lineage, and appears during erythroid differentiation before glycophorin A on the earliest morphologically recognizable erythroid precursor, the proerythroblast. Our results therefore suggest that O-linked oligosaccharides on leukosialin express lineage restricted and even maturation restricted antigenic structures that might serve as cell lineage specific markers.","['Bettaieb, A', 'Farace, F', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Mishal, Z', 'Dokhelar, M C', 'Tursz, T', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Kieffer, N']","['Bettaieb A', 'Farace F', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Mishal Z', 'Dokhelar MC', 'Tursz T', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Vainchenker W', 'Kieffer N']","['INSERM U 91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spn protein, mouse)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epitopes/immunology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Glycosylation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Leukosialin', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77225-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 May;71(5):1226-33.,,,,,,,,,

The 5' long terminal repeat region was analyzed by strong stop cDNA synthesis and S1 nuclease mapping. The length of the RU5 region was determined and found to be 346 nucleotides long. The 5' long terminal repeat is 1,123 base pairs long and is bound by an 18-base-pair primer-binding site complementary to the 3' end of mammalian lysine-1,2-specific tRNA. Open reading frames for gag and pol genes were identified. Surprisingly, the HSRV gag protein does not contain the cysteine motif of the nucleic acid-binding proteins found in and typical of all other retroviral gag proteins; instead the HSRV gag gene encodes a strongly basic protein reminiscent of those of hepatitis B virus and retrotransposons. The carboxy-terminal part of the HSRV gag gene products encodes a protease domain. The pol gene overlaps the gag gene and is postulated to be synthesized as a gag/pol precursor via translational frameshifting analogous to that of Rous sarcoma virus, with 7 nucleotides immediately upstream of the termination codons of gag conserved between the two viral genomes. The HSRV pol gene is 2,730 nucleotides long, and its deduced protein sequence is readily subdivided into three well-conserved domains, the reverse transcriptase, the RNase H, and the integrase. Although the degree of homology of the HSRV reverse transcriptase domain is highest to that of murine leukemia virus, the HSRV genomic organization is more similar to that of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.

IT-As were prepared by coupling intact antibodies, F(ab')2, or Fab' fragments to native or chemically deglycosylated ricin A chain. The IT-As were then evaluated for cytotoxicity to normal and neoplastic human B-cells in vitro with the major objective of appraising their suitability for in vivo therapy of human B-cell tumors. The IT-As prepared with both the HD6 and HD37 antibodies were specifically toxic to normal B-cells and to most of the neoplastic B-cell lines tested. However, the IT-As prepared from HD6 were generally more potent than those prepared from HD37. On Daudi cells, to which the two antibodies bound in similar numbers and with similar affinities, IT-As prepared with intact HD6 antibody or its Fab' fragment were 10-fold and 1.5- to 4-fold more potent, respectively, than the corresponding HD37 IT-As. The IT-As constructed from intact HD6 antibody and native or deglycosylated A chain reduced protein synthesis in Daudi cells by 50% at a concentration of 1.2 X 10(-11) M indicating that they were only 5-fold less toxic to the cells than ricin itself. Intact HD37 IT-As produced equivalent inhibition of protein synthesis at 1.5 X 10(-10) M. With both antibodies, IT-As constructed from the Fab' fragments were 10- to 20-fold less potent than their intact antibody counterparts. Different neoplastic B-cell lines varied in sensitivity to the IT-As. In most cases, their sensitivity correlated with the levels of CD19 and CD22 antigens expressed. Neither HD6 nor HD37 IT-As affected the ability of normal human bone marrow cells to form granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units in soft agar, suggesting that both antigens are absent from these progenitor cells. Examination of sections of frozen human tissues using immunoperoxidase staining procedures indicated that the antibodies did not bind to a panel of normal tissues lacking B-lymphocytes. These results suggest that HD6 and HD37 IT-As are candidates for in vivo therapy in humans with certain B-cell tumors. However, HD6 IT-As are more potent, reduce protein synthesis more completely, and hence appear to be the ITs of choice for treating tumors expressing the CD22 antigen.","['Ghetie, M A', 'May, R D', 'Till, M', 'Uhr, J W', 'Ghetie, V', 'Knowles, P P', 'Relf, M', 'Brown, A', 'Wallace, P M', 'Janossy, G']","['Ghetie MA', 'May RD', 'Till M', 'Uhr JW', 'Ghetie V', 'Knowles PP', 'Relf M', 'Brown A', 'Wallace PM', 'Janossy G', 'et al.']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],"['CA-28149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Ricin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 May 1;48(9):2610-7.,,,,['Cancer Res 1988 Aug 15;48(16):4716'],,,,,

Reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes are routinely obtained following solubilization of virus particles with Triton X-100. This detergent has a low critical micellar concentration which precludes it from being the best detergent of choice in reconstitution studies. Nevertheless, it has remained in use since other detergents such as sodium deoxycholate and sodium cholate rendered the resultant vesicles inactive. Triton X-100 may be suboptimal for studies of some proteins that need be coreconstituted with the viral envelopes. Thus, alternative advantageous detergents, which retain the envelope fusogenic activity, have been sought. In this study we show that the synthetic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (Chaps) effectively solubilizes the Sendai virions, and that the vesicles formed by simple reconstitution protocols appear structurally and biochemically similar to those obtained with Triton X-100. The resultant vesicles retain functional integrity as assessed in both fusion and hemolysis assays. This protocol seems to be useful in sendai envelope-mediated reimplantation of Fc epsilon receptors into the plasma membranes of rat basophilic leukemia cells.","['Ran, S', 'Nussbaum, O', 'Loyter, A', 'Marikovsky, Y', 'Rivnay, B']","['Ran S', 'Nussbaum O', 'Loyter A', 'Marikovsky Y', 'Rivnay B']","['Department of Membrane Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['ALY 1 R01 AI 22669-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Cholic Acids)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', 'QBP25342AG (3-((3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonium)-1-propanesulfonate)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/analysis', 'Cholic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Detergents/*pharmacology', 'Hemolysis', 'Octoxynol', 'Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human/*analysis', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Surface-Active Agents/*pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*analysis', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*analysis']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(88)90360-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(88)90360-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1988 Mar;261(2):437-46. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(88)90360-8.,,,,,,,,,

The killing was specific for PPD from M. tuberculosis; and targets coupled to Con A alone or to PPD from M. paratuberculosis were not killed. Target cells carrying Con A-PPD were more effectively lysed than PPD-pulsed cells. This form of lymphocyte killing, though highly significant, was inefficient. Maximum killing of PPD carrying targets was 30-40% at effector to target ratios of 20:1 and at 16 h. Cells carrying 2 x 10(6) molecules of PPD and less than 1.5 x 10(6) molecules Con A per cell were killed most efficiently. A major distinction between this helper T cell killing and that mediated by cytotoxic T cells was that both TH clones displayed bystander lysis and killed PPD uncoupled targets when these were cultured with syngeneic PPD-bound targets. This suggests that the mechanism of cytotoxicity may involve soluble mediators.","['Vyakarnam, A', 'Lachmann, P J', 'Sia, D Y']","['Vyakarnam A', 'Lachmann PJ', 'Sia DY']","['Mechanisms in Tumour Immunity Unit, MRC Centre, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Tuberculin)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Concanavalin A/analysis/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Fibrosarcoma/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Tuberculin/analysis/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb02355.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1988 Mar;27(3):337-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb02355.x.,,,,,,,,,

Conflicting results have been reported for the transforming ability of pp60c-src mutants having only mutations outside its carboxyl-terminal region. To clarify the effects of such mutations, we tested the activities of chimeric v(amino)- and c(carboxyl)-src (v/c-src) proteins at different dosages in NIH 3T3 cells. The focus-forming activity of Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (LTR)-src expression plasmids was significantly reduced when the v-src 3' coding region was replaced with the corresponding c-src region. This difference was masked when the Rous sarcoma virus LTR was replaced with the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR, which induced approximately 20-fold more protein expression, but even focus-selected lines expressing v/c-src proteins were unable to form large colonies in soft agarose or tumors in NFS mice. This suggests that pp60c-src is not equally sensitive to mutations in its different domains and that there are at least two distinguishable levels of regulation, the dominant one being associated with its carboxyl terminus. v/c-src chimeric proteins expressed with either LTR had high in vitro specific kinase activity equal to that of pp60v-src but, in contrast, were phosphorylated at both Tyr-527 and Tyr-416. Total cell protein phosphotyrosine was enhanced in cells incompletely transformed by v/c-src proteins to the same extent as in v-src-transformed cells, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region may affect substrate specificity in a manner that is important for transformation.","['Reddy, S', 'Yaciuk, P', 'Kmiecik, T E', 'Coussens, P M', 'Shalloway, D']","['Reddy S', 'Yaciuk P', 'Kmiecik TE', 'Coussens PM', 'Shalloway D']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802.']",['eng'],['CA32317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)', 'Oncogenes', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.2.704-712.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Feb;8(2):704-12. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.2.704-712.1988.,,,,,,PMC363196,,,

The present studies have monitored the effects of the stable adenosine receptor ligand N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) on induction of MEL cell differentiation. PIA has been previously shown to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in rat hepatic and mouse Leydig 1-10 cells as well as inhibit adenylate cyclase in adipocytes. In the present study, PIA was ineffective as an inducer of the differentiated MEL cell phenotype. However, the results demonstrate that PIA inhibits the induction of MEL cell differentiation by DMSO and xylosyladenine. The extent of this inhibition as determined by benzidine staining, induction of globin RNA, and loss of self-renewal capacity was dependent on PIA concentration. The results also demonstrate that PIA induces a rapid and sustained increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Furthermore, there was a highly significant correlation between cAMP levels and inhibition of xylosyladenine-induced differentiation (r = 0.962, P less than 0.0005). This relationship is further supported by the demonstration that prostaglandins E1 and E2 increase MEL cell cAMP levels and inhibit induction of the differentiated MEL cell phenotype. Moreover, PIA inhibited induction of MEL cell differentiation by butyric acid, diazepam, hypoxanthine, and the aminonucleoside analog of puromycin. These results suggest that cAMP may act as a negative regulatory signal in the induction of MEL cell differentiation.","['Sherman, M L', 'Shafman, T D', 'Kufe, D W']","['Sherman ML', 'Shafman TD', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Center Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['CA01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Ligands)', '29193-86-0 (Phenylisopropyladenosine)', '4185-03-9 (9-xylosyladenine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylisopropyladenosine/*pharmacology', 'RNA/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041340314 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1988 Mar;134(3):429-36. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041340314.,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition by suramin of DNA polymerase alpha from KB cells and Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) reverse transcriptase was due to competition with the respective template primer (activated DNA for alpha polymerase and (rA)n.(dT)12-18 for reverse transcriptase) for the template.primer-binding site of the enzyme, while the inhibition of DNA primase and E.coli RNA polymerase was due to competition with the ribonucleoside triphosphate substrate.

By using indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry we found both non-coordination and heterogeneity in expression of MHC class II antigens but generally with a hierarchy of positivity: DR greater than DQ greater than DP. This suggests a sequence of gradual acquisition of HLA-D antigens and indicates distinct differences in maturation arrest of the individual cases. However, after treatment with phorbol ester TPA and calcium ionophore A23187, all cases expressed the previously absent molecules indicating that the structural genes for these products remained intact. TPA and A23187 increased both the number of positive cells in most cases and the fluorescence staining intensities of all class II markers including RFD1.

In order to study MTX accumulation and metabolism to polyglutamate derivatives in different age populations of red blood cells, we took erythrocytes from 12 children with ALL who were receiving maintenance treatment with MTX and 6-MP and separated them according to age on a discontinuous Percoll gradient. When the erythrocytes of these children were separated according to specific gravity a normal distribution was obtained. Age fractionation was confirmed by the exponential decline of the erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase (ery-ASAT) and by the reticulocyte counts. The ery-MTX declined with increasing red blood cell age in an exponential manner no different from the decline of the ery-ASAT. The youngest population of red blood cells contained 2.3-5.9 (mean 3.8) times more MTX than the oldest population. By linear regression analysis the t1/2 of the ery-MTX was 19-79 days (mean 37 days). The ery-MTX t1/2 seemed to be directly related to the amount of MTX which had been metabolized to MTX-glu3-5. The decline of the ery-MTX was predominantly due to selective disappearance of MTX-glu1+2, whereas MTX-glu3-5 changed to a much lesser extent with advancing red blood cell age. The present investigation showed that steady-state ery-MTX concentration was determined by (1) the amount of MTX added to the circulation by the reticulocytes, (2) the in vivo loss predominantly of MTX with low numbers of glutamyl derivatives from erythrocytes, and (3) the loss of MTX from destroyed red blood cells.

The concentration of MTX-glu3-5 remained constant in the erythrocyte throughout its life span and declined only with age-dependent destruction of the red blood cell.

Organic Ca2+-channel blockers, such as verapamil, can reverse this resistance and render MDR cells in culture nearly as sensitive to the antineoplastic drugs as the drug-sensitive cells from which they were derived. It has therefore been suggested that Ca2+ channels may play a role in MDR. To determine directly whether there are electrophysiological correlates of MDR, we used whole-cell and single-channel patch-clamp techniques to survey the ion channels in a drug-sensitive human T-cell leukemia line, CCRF-CEM, and a MDR variant, CEM/VLB100. We found no evidence for a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. However, we did identify three other current/channel types: a voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive inward current carried by Na+, a voltage-gated labile outward current carried by K+, and a nonselective cation channel reversing at 0 mV.

Temporal identification of the signal calcium influx mediated by the receptor-operated channel pathway.,693-701,"Antigen-induced 45calcium influx into rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells was examined with emphasis on the early time domain under conditions that exclude loss of the cation during the subsequent washing step. Such preparations demonstrate a distinct, temporally separate influx peaking at 3 min, followed by a substantial efflux. This internalized 45Ca2+ approaches millimolar total intracellular concentration and is therefore either sequestered or becomes bound to intracellular components (proteins). The amplitude of this influx is linearly proportional to IgE-receptor occupancy at low receptor occupancies, and is sensitive to the anti-allergic drug cromolyn. Furthermore, the timing of both the maximal uptake and the maximal susceptibility to cromolyn correlates with the Quin-2 signal in these cells, and the initial degranulation pattern bears some resemblance to trends in the 45Ca2+ uptake curve. These qualities suggest that the early peak at 2-3 min, rather than any later 45Ca2+ uptake, comprises the initial signalling Ca2+ pool. Maximal apparent inhibition by cromolyn for 45Ca2+ uptake was about 65% and required a 10-15-min preincubation with the cells. The inhibitory effect was limited to the peak at 3 min, suggesting that tracer incorporation beyond 5-6 min largely involves other pools or pathways, triggered by receptor aggregation, yet only indirectly related to channel activity or to the signal proper. A quantitative similarity was found between the early peak measured on intact cells and the single channel conductance measured on reconstituted planar bilayers containing the purified receptor for IgE and the purified cromolyn-binding protein [Corcia, A. et al. (1986) EM BO J. 5, 849-854]. This, as well as the effects of cromolyn, support the assumption that cromolyn-binding protein is a major constituent involved in this early influx, or that influx is a principal pathway for the signaling calcium mass.","['Ran, S', 'Rivnay, B']","['Ran S', 'Rivnay B']","['Department of Membrane Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['ALY 1 RO1 AI 22669-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'Q2WXR1I0PK (Cromolyn Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Basophils', 'Biotransformation/drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cromolyn Sodium/pharmacology', 'Ion Channels/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1988.tb13841.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1988 Feb 1;171(3):693-701. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1988.tb13841.x.,,,,,,,,,

Since they are not converted to 7-hydroxy derivatives, they have been investigated with regard to their cytotoxicity for CCRF-CEM cells, transport into these cells, and conversion to polyglutamate forms. For this purpose 3H-labeled analogues were synthesized. The drug concentrations of the analogues required to inhibit cell growth by 50% are significantly lower than for the parent compounds particularly for a short exposure of cells to the drug. Vmax and Km for unidirectional influx do not differ greatly among the four drugs, but amounts of uptake over 1 h are markedly different and increase in the order MTX less than 8-deazaMTX less than AMT less than 8-deazaAMT. During 1 h of uptake a much greater proportion of the 8-deaza analogues is converted to polyglutamate forms than in the case of parent drugs. Only 52% of MTX is converted to polyglutamates, whereas in the case of the other three compounds the conversion is greater than or equal to 90%. However, MTX is relatively efficient in adding two glutamate residues, whereas the other drugs predominantly accumulate as forms with only one additional glutamate (+Glu1). During 1 h of efflux the drugs without additional glutamates decrease to low concentrations and there is also a major loss of +Glu1 form, but there is also an increase in longer chain forms, especially in the case of MTX. The net result is a still greater disparity in total intracellular levels of the four drugs after the period of efflux. MTX has much lower toxicity in mice in vivo than the other three compounds, 8-deazaAMT being the most toxic. At the maximum tolerated dose MTX produced a considerably greater increase in life span for mice bearing P388 than any of the other drugs, and a somewhat greater increase for mice bearing L1210. Thus the 8-deaza analogues do not offer a therapeutic advantage over MTX against leukemias in the mouse, primarily due to their much greater toxicity.","['Kuehl, M', 'Brixner, D I', 'Broom, A D', 'Avery, T L', 'Blakley, R L']","['Kuehl M', 'Brixner DI', 'Broom AD', 'Avery TL', 'Blakley RL']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['CA 31922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Peptides)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/analysis']",1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Mar 15;48(6):1481-8.,,,,,,,,,

The isolated toxin binds to the plasma membrane of RBL cells and polymerizes to form a transmembrane pore that allows small molecules (Mr less than 1000), but not macromolecules, to diffuse freely across the membrane. There was no spontaneous release of the contents of RBL cell secretory granules during permeabilization or subsequent incubations. Substantial IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis occurred in the absence of Ca2+, and degranulation was maximal at 0.1-1.0 microM Ca2+, the physiologically important range of Ca2+ concentrations.

When 32D Cl3 cells are transferred to IL-3-free medium which contains recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), the cell number increases four- to five-fold, and after 14 days the whole cell population is differentiated into morphologically normal and myeloperoxidase- and lactoferrin-positive metamyelocytes and granulocytes. Infection with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) of 32D Cl3 cells growing in the presence of IL-3 induces, within 2 weeks, the appearance of cells that are IL-3-independent for growth. The latter cells lack myeloid, T and B cell markers, and are unable to differentiate, even in the presence of very high doses of rhG-CSF. However, once the 32D Cl3 cells have been exposed to G-CSF, they become resistant to the transforming effects of A-MuLV as judged by the appearance of the IL-3-independent clones. These findings suggest that the ability of Abelson virus to transform immature progenitor cells is due to interference of the v-abl gene product with the mechanisms that control the commitment of the cells to differentiate.","['Rovera, G', 'Valtieri, M', 'Mavilio, F', 'Reddy, E P']","['Rovera G', 'Valtieri M', 'Mavilio F', 'Reddy EP']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['CA 10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1987 Mar;1(1):29-35.,,,,,,,,,

After cell counting, pelletting the cell suspension and correcting for the admixture of supernatant, AMSA was extracted from the WBCs and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Linearity of extraction was observed up to 40.10(6) cells. The inter-assay variation was 4.7%. Plasma and cellular concentrations were measured in five patients at the end of a 3-h infusion of 100 mg/m2 AMSA. A pharmacokinetic study of plasma and cellular AMSA concentrations up to 19 h after infusion was carried out. AMSA concentrations in WBCs correlated well with the plasma levels (n = 20, r = 0.967) with an accumulation factor compared to the plasma concentration of 2.6-9.8 in the patients studied.

Therapeutic activity has been observed against murine and human leukemias, transplantable murine solid tumors, and human tumor xenografts. Arabinosyl-5-azacytosine exhibited a broader spectrum of activity against human solid tumors than cytosine arabinoside. Arabinosyl-5-azacytosine is phosphorylated to the nucleotide level by deoxycytidine kinase. Upon further anabolism to the triphosphate level, it can be incorporated into DNA. The mechanism of cytotoxicity is thought to be related to inhibition of DNA synthesis. Leukemic and solid tumor cell lines that are resistant to cytosine arabinoside due to deletion of deoxycytidine kinase activity are cross-resistant to arabinosyl-5-azacytosine. Unlike cytosine arabinoside, arabinosyl-5-azacytosine does not readily undergo deamination. Schedule dependence has been demonstrated in mice bearing L1210 leukemia, with superior activity seen with multiple doses administered on each treatment day compared to administration of larger but less frequently administered doses. From preliminary data in solid tumor models, however, antitumor activity did not appear to be superior with continuous infusion compared to that observed on a bolus schedule. Preclinical toxicology studies indicated that the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract were the main target organs. A single large dose of arabinosyl-5-azacytosine could be tolerated by both mice and dogs. When administered as a continuous infusion, the toxicity was related to both the dose and duration of exposure, suggesting that toxicity resulted from a critical time above a threshold concentration as opposed to the total area under the concentration-time curve. Phase I clinical trials have been initiated to determine the maximum tolerated dose on a low dose continuous infusion schedule for 72 hours and also on a high dose short infusion daily times five schedule.","['Grem, J L', 'Shoemaker, D D', 'Hoth, D F', 'King, S A', 'Plowman, J', 'Zaharko, D', 'Grieshaber, C K', 'Harrison, S D Jr', 'Cradock, J C', 'Leyland-Jones, B']","['Grem JL', 'Shoemaker DD', 'Hoth DF', 'King SA', 'Plowman J', 'Zaharko D', 'Grieshaber CK', 'Harrison SD Jr', 'Cradock JC', 'Leyland-Jones B']","['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '5V71D8JOKK (fazarabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans']",1987/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00169970 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1987 Dec;5(4):315-28. doi: 10.1007/BF00169970.,32,,,,,,,,

The antibody was raised against the colon carcinoma cell line HT-29. Under reducing conditions HEA125 immunoprecipitates a surface glycoprotein of Mr 34,000 which was designated Egp34. The antigen does not contain disulfide-linked subunits. A slightly different migration behavior under non-reducing conditions (Mr 39,000) may be due to intrachain disulfide bonds. After enzymatic cleavage of N-linked carbohydrate residues the apparent molecular weight of the antigen was 29,000. Egp34 is a major cell surface component of HT-29 cells (10(6) molecules per cell). No antigen could be detected in the sera of colorectal cancer patients. A panel of malignant cell lines and normal cells was studied for surface expression of the antigen. 17/17 carcinoma lines of 6 different origins expressed the antigen, whereas 16/16 melanoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma and lymphoma/leukaemia were unreactive as it was the case for normal fibroblasts and blood cells. Immunoperoxidase staining of frozen tissue sections with HEA125 demonstrated the presence of Egp34 in almost all normal epithelia and tumours derived therefrom. No reactivity with non-epithelial tissues was observed. Undifferentiated carcinomas of various origins homogeneously expressed Egp34.

Combination chemotherapy with FUra and thymidine was performed to determine the therapeutic relevance of 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) incorporation into RNA. The results of these studies indicate that modulation of FUra cytotoxicity by deoxythymidine (dThd) did occur but failed to produce any significant therapeutic advantages in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Modulation of FUra bioactivation via the deoxyribonucleotide pathway by coadministration of high-dose folinic acid resulted in enhanced therapeutic response rate of gastrointestinal tumor patients.

Since these studies have almost exclusively been done by Northern and dot blot hybridization techniques using mixed populations of cells, any conclusions concerning quantitative changes in gene expression are difficult to document. We have developed a rapid and sensitive RNA-in situ hybridization technique permitting detection of as few as five copies of mRNA per cell. Using this technique we have studied the expression of two genes, c-myc and c-sis, in acute leukemia patients as well as hematologically normal individuals. We have found that expression levels of myc and often sis are higher (greater than 5-fold) in hematopoietic cells obtained from leukemia patients than in normal hematopoietic cells. In regenerating marrow, there is a dramatic increase in the frequency of cells expressing myc at the level of five to 10 copies without the presence of any cells expressing myc at the high levels found in acute leukemia. This is completely different from leukemic remission marrow in which we find a subpopulation of cells which express myc at very high levels. At this time, the leukemic origin of this abnormal cell population is likely because of the close correlation we find between gene overexpression and leukemic phenotype as identified by double-labeling experiments. It appears that gene overexpression may be a more sensitive or an earlier marker for leukemic cells and that such an assay could be used in the detection of residual disease.","['Evinger-Hodges, M J', 'Bresser, J', 'Brouwer, R', 'Cox, I', 'Spitzer, G', 'Dicke, K']","['Evinger-Hodges MJ', 'Bresser J', 'Brouwer R', 'Cox I', 'Spitzer G', 'Dicke K']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas System Cancer Center M.

A high level of ets-1 expression was found in murine thymocyte mRNA as well. Investigation of the ets-1 expression levels in human leukemic samples showed that primary malignant T cells (T-ALLs), corresponding to intrathymic stages of maturation, have a much higher level of ets-1 mRNA than malignant T lymphoid cells with a mature phenotype, such as adult T cell leukemias (ATLs). T-ALLs were also higher in ets-1 expression than the other lymphoid (pre-T-ALL, c-ALL, pre-B-ALL) malignant cells analyzed. Insignificant amounts of the specific ets-1 mRNA were detected in several acute myeloid leukemias representing various degrees of maturation. The elevated ets-1 mRNA in thymocytes suggests a biological role for the ets-1 product in these cells that could be explored to investigate ets-1 function.

The avid binding of IgE antibodies to FcR on mast cells and basophils suggested the possible use of an IgE-immunotoxin in the treatment of malignant mastocytosis or as a method to generate mast cell-depleted animals for study. To this end, the effect of a covalent conjugate of rat myeloma IgE and ricin A chain on rat cutaneous mast cells was examined in vivo. IgE-ricin A chain was capable of binding to and sensitizing cutaneous mast cells in vivo as indicated by a bluing response to intracutaneous anti-ricin A chain.

Identification of lysine 103 and lysine 421 as binding site residues.,1648-53,"The substrate deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) binding site of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase was labeled with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), a substrate binding site-directed reagent for DNA polymerases (Modak, M. J. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 3620-3626). Treatment of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase with PLP results in the loss of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, but has no effect on ribonuclease H activity. Neither template-primer nor substrate dNTP alone shows any protective effect from PLP-mediated inactivation. However, the presence of both template-primer and complementary substrate dNTP significantly protects M-MuLV reverse transcriptase from PLP inhibition. Using tritiated sodium borohydride to label the pyridoxylated enzyme, approximately 4 mol of PLP were incorporated per mol of enzyme. In the presence of template-primer and the complementary dNTP, however, only 2 mol of PLP were incorporated. Comparative tryptic peptide mapping of enzyme, modified in the presence and absence of substrates by PLP reaction on C-18 reverse phase columns, indicated the protection of two peptides from pyridoxylation in the presence of substrate triphosphate. These two peptides were further purified and characterized by amino acid analyses and sequencing and were found to span residues 103 to 110 and 412 to 425 in the primary amino acid sequence of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, Lys-103 of peptide I and Lys-421 of peptide II were found to be the targets of pyridoxylation, indicating that these 2 lysine residues are involved in substrate dNTP binding in M-MuLV reverse transcriptase.","['Basu, A', 'Nanduri, V B', 'Gerard, G F', 'Modak, M J']","['Basu A', 'Nanduri VB', 'Gerard GF', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '5V5IOJ8338 (Pyridoxal Phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/metabolism', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Lysine/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H']",1988/02/05 00:00,1988/02/05 00:01,['1988/02/05 00:00'],"['1988/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)77926-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Feb 5;263(4):1648-53.,,,,,,,,,

Mo-Y1 specifically reacts with Jurkat cells, but not with other cell lines. Immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunochemical analysis demonstrate that Mo-Y1 defines an antigen with a molecular weight of 200,000 and a pI value of 5.3 to 5.6. Rabbit antibody against affinity-purified Y1 antigen was prepared. A sequential immunoprecipitation study confirmed that Po-Y1 reacted with the same antigen molecule recognized by Mo-Y1. Interestingly, Mo-Y1 reacted only with Jurkat cells, whereas Po-Y1 reacted with various hematopoietic cells including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and granulocytes. Po-Y1 precipitated a 200,000-dalton component from Jurkat cells and T cells. In contrast, Po-Y1 precipitated a 230,000-dalton component from B cells. These data led us to examine the relationship between T200, leukocyte-common antigen and Y1-defined antigen. Sequential immunoprecipitation analysis clearly indicated that T200 antibody and Y1 antibody recognized the same antigen molecule. Peptide mapping of T200- and Mo-Y1-defined antigen digested with V8 protease demonstrated that there were two common major peptide chains, but one peptide chain was missing in Jurkat cells that was present in T200 glycoprotein of other cells. It is possible that minor molecular modification of T200 glycoprotein occurred in the process of oncogenesis of T cells and that the altered epitope of T200 glycoprotein was recognized by Mo-Y1. The Y1 antigen can be classified as a tumor-specific antigen.","['Yamaguchi, A', 'Uede, T', 'Kokai, Y', 'Ishii, Y', 'Kikuchi, K']","['Yamaguchi A', 'Uede T', 'Kokai Y', 'Ishii Y', 'Kikuchi K']","['Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical College.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Cell Line', '*Epitopes', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Molecular Weight']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1987 Dec;78(12):1378-89.,,,,,,,,,

This epitope was not detected by western blotting or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments with three different lots of polyclonal R-MLV gp69/71 sera. However, it was detected when a specific monoclonal antibody, R47, was used in western blotting or immuno-dot-blotting experiments with the two viruses. R47 maps to a central 14-kd segment on R-MLV gp71 which spans an important structural domain, namely, that corresponding to the recombination site between ecotropic and endogenous envelope glycoprotein-coding sequences. Analysis of the western as well as dot blots developed with the R47 monoclonal antibody showed that about a 25-fold higher affinity for the epitope existed on R-MLV gp71, relative to M-MLV gp70. It thus appears that R-MLV and M-MLV gp70, although very closely related both structurally and serologically, are conformationally distinct in one domain, namely, the site of recombination between ecotropic and endogenous gp70-coding sequences.","['Trauger, R', 'Rayfield, M A', 'Luftig, R B']","['Trauger R', 'Rayfield MA', 'Luftig RB']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia.']",['eng'],['CA-37380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Intervirology,Intervirology,0364265,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Immune Sera', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Rauscher Virus/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/analysis/*immunology', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000149995 [doi]'],ppublish,Intervirology. 1987;28(1):40-9. doi: 10.1159/000149995.,,,,,,,,,

Radioimmuno-precipitation (RIP) tests with the MAbs showed that TA34 antigen had at least 3 overlapping epitope groups. The antigenicities of the TA34 antigens of HTLV-I-infected cells derived from various primates were investigated by immunofluorescence staining using 9 anti-TA34 MAbs. Cells from humans, apes and Old World monkeys reacted with all these antibodies, whereas cells from New World monkeys were stained by most of the antibodies, but little if at all by the remaining 2 (5A8 and TAG34). Similar results were obtained with various primate cells infected with STLV-I. All 17 MAbs used recognized a 22-kDa peptide in HTLV-I-infected cells cultured in the presence of tunicamycin. When incubated with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol at pH 7.2 at 37 degrees C, TA34 antigen lost its reactivity with TAG34, suggesting that the antigen has an intramolecular S-S bond.

The effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on myeloid leukemias is unique among colony-stimulating factors in driving the leukemic cells from a self-renewing malignant state to a mature differentiated phenotype with the concomitant loss of tumorigenicity. This property of G-CSF has led to suggestions that its absence is responsible for lack of differentiation of leukemic cells and that the therapeutic administration of G-CSF could reverse this defect and result in a cure for leukemia. Here we show that the gene coding for human G-CSF is localized to chromosome 17, bands q11.2-21. The translocation of the long arm of chromosome 17 at q12-21 to chromosome 15 is a specific abnormality occurring in a high proportion of, if not all, patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, a disease characterized by undifferentiated myeloid cells and a dismal prognosis.

Different clones of myeloid leukemic cells can differ in their response to these regulatory proteins. One type of leukemic clone can be differentiated in vitro to mature cells by incubating with the growth-inducing proteins granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CSF or IL-3, and another type of clone can be differentiated in vitro to mature cells by the differentiation-inducing protein MGI-2. We have now studied the ability of different myeloid regulatory proteins to induce the in vivo differentiation of these different types of mouse myeloid leukemic clones in normal and cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The results show that in both types of mice (a) the in vitro GM-CSF- and IL-3-sensitive leukemic cells were induced to differentiate to mature cells in vivo in mice injected with pure recombinant GM-CSF and IL-3 but not with G-CSF, M-CSF, or MGI-2; (b) the in vitro MGI-2-sensitive leukemic cells differentiated in vivo by injection of MGI-2 and also, presumably indirectly, by GM-CSF and IL-3 but not by M-CSF or G-CSF; (c) in vivo induced differentiation of the leukemic cells was associated with a 20- to 60-fold decrease in the number of blast cells; and (d) all the injected myeloid regulatory proteins stimulated the normal myelopoietic system. Different normal myeloid regulatory proteins can thus induce in vivo terminal differentiation of leukemic cells, and it is suggested that these proteins can have a therapeutic potential for myeloid leukemia in addition to their therapeutic potential in stimulating normal hematopoiesis.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']","['Department of Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78185-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Feb;71(2):375-82.,,,,,,,,,

We found no measurable D-phosphoserine in erythrocyte membrane proteins under conditions where a 1% content of this residue relative to L-phosphoserine would have been detected. These values can be used to place an upper hypothetical limit on the fraction of erythrocyte protein kinase activity that is specific for serine residues in the D-configuration. In separate experiments, we examined the specificity of the tyrosyl protein kinases.

Previous work had demonstrated that the BALB/c endogenous ecotropic provirus was infectious but unable to induce XC cell syncytia formation, and that induced (BALB/c X B6) hybrid cells expressed 10- to 50-fold more XC syncytia than induced parental cells. Two independently isolated DNA clones of the B6 endogenous ecotropic provirus were noninfectious following transfection into cells, and cell lines that expressed this viral genome produced noninfectious MuLV. Nucleotide sequencing of the mutant region of the B6 provirus indicated that the defective nature of this provirus resulted from an amino acid substitution of proline for alanine in the central portion of reverse transcriptase. From the analysis of the virus produced by induced hybrid cells, and the patterns of steady-state viral RNA in induced cells, we propose that the enhanced XC cell syncytia formation observed in hybrid cells is due to trans-complementation of viral proteins and not viral recombination or trans-activation of viral genome expression.","['King, S R', 'Berson, B J', 'Risser, R']","['King SR', 'Berson BJ', 'Risser R']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201.']",['eng'],"['CA07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Hybrid Cells/*microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/*microbiology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*microbiology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(88)90388-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1988 Jan;162(1):1-11. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(88)90388-1.,,,,,,,,,

The biochemical effects of these drugs on L1210 leukemia cells and their interaction with DNA were studied and compared to clinically used intercalators. The benzothiopyranoindazoles bound to DNA with a relatively high affinity, having intrinsic association constants of between 3 and 4 x 10(5) M-1. Based on viscosity measurements, the mode of DNA binding appears to be through intercalation. Unwinding angles were calculated to be approximately 18 degrees. The benzothiopyranoindazoles were potent inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis, reducing both DNA and RNA synthesis to the same extent at similar concentrations. Like other known intercalators, these compounds produced DNA single- and double-strand breaks in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in L1210 cells. Between one and two DNA strand breaks were formed per protein-strand crosslink. Repair of these DNA lesions after the drug was removed from the cells was either very slow or did not occur at all for at least 2 hr. Finally, since the high incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with the administration of anthracyclines has been related to the formation of reactive oxygen species, the ability of the benzothiopyranoindazoles to augment superoxide dismutase-sensitive oxygen consumption was observed in a rat liver microsomal system. These compounds produced less than 5% of the activity in this assay that doxorubicin produced.","['Fry, D W', 'Besserer, J A']","['Fry DW', 'Besserer JA']","['Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '113457-06-0 (PD 121373)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '8HBT2JRJ5T (ledoxantrone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '94636-28-9 (PD 114595)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', '*DNA/biosynthesis', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Free Radicals', 'Indazoles/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Intercalating Agents', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Pyrazoles/*metabolism', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1988 Jan;33(1):84-92.,,,,,,,,,

They also raise the possibility that this in vitro selectivity may be related to enhanced expansion of dCTP pools in normal bone marrow elements and involves factors other than differential short-term analog incorporation into DNA.","['Bhalla, K', 'Cole, J', 'MacLaughlin, W', 'Arlin, Z', 'Baker, M', 'Graham, G', 'Grant, S']","['Bhalla K', 'Cole J', 'MacLaughlin W', 'Arlin Z', 'Baker M', 'Graham G', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York.']",['eng'],['R01 CA-35601-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '5V71D8JOKK (fazarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Deoxycytidine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Dec;1(12):814-9.,,,,,,,,,

It is found intracellularly, and current immunocytochemical studies suggest that, in the absence of ligand, it is predominantly cytoplasmic. Limited proteolysis shows that the protein can be divided into steroid-binding, DNA-binding and strongly antigenic regions, roughly one-third each of the molecule. Recently, the hGR gene has been cloned and sequenced, and analysis of the gene has confirmed and extended this general description of the protein. The DNA-binding region is cysteine-rich, and the carboxy-terminal end of the molecule is the steroid-binding region. Analysis of CEM cells, a line of human leukemic lymphoblasts, has resulted in isolation of three classes of resistant cells: receptor-site deficient (r-), receptor activation labile (r act/l), and wild-type receptor but lysis-defective (r+ly-). Monoclonal antibodies to the hGR have been produced and used to show that the r- clone does contain immunoreactive receptor. Northern blots of the RNA of these cells, probed with the full-length hGR cDNA, reveal that the r- cells have mRNA for hGR of normal size but somewhat less in amount than normal r+ cells. Previous somatic cell hybrids had shown failure to complement in crosses between r- and r act/l mutants, but dominance of the sensitive phenotype in r+ x r- and r+ x r act/l hybrids. We now show, however, that the r+ly- clone does complement the receptor-site deficient (r-) mutant. Hybrids between the two are completely steroid sensitive.","['Thompson, E B']",['Thompson EB'],"['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Steroid Biochem,Journal of steroid biochemistry,0260125,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis/drug effects']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0022-4731(87)90300-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem. 1987;27(1-3):105-8. doi: 10.1016/0022-4731(87)90300-1.,28,,,,,,,,

The virus nonproducer phenotype was a stable characteristic of clones derived from in vivo-passaged IFN-sensitive 745 FLCs. In contrast, in vivo passages of IFN-resistant 3Cl-8 FLCs and L1210-R cells did not result in any significant decrease in the capacity of these tumor cells to release in vitro RT activity. Although in vitro treatment of IFN-sensitive FLCs with mouse alpha/beta IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) for 1 or 10 passages resulted in a marked inhibition in the release of RT activity, these effects were completely reversible after removal of IFN from the culture medium. In addition, in vitro treatment of 745 FLCs with IFN resulted in a marked increase in the expression of H-2 (class I) and gp70 Friend virus antigens on the cell membrane. These effects were not observed in IFN-resistant 3Cl-8 cells. To investigate the possible role of endogenous IFN in the in vivo selection of virus nonproducer tumor cells, IFN-sensitive virus producer FLCs were serially passaged intraperitoneally in mice treated with antibodies to IFN-alpha/beta and in control mice, and the recovered tumor cells were cloned in vitro. Most (83 to 91%) of the clones derived from 745 cells recovered from control mice did not produce any detectable RT activity in the culture supernatants. In contrast, 96% of the clones (26 of 27) derived from 745 cells recovered from mice serially treated with antibodies to IFN-alpha/beta were still capable of releasing high levels of RT activity in the culture medium, indicating that endogenous IFN-alpha/beta was indeed an important host component for the in vivo selection of virus nonproducer tumor cell variants. The results reported in this article indicate that both direct effects of IFN on tumor cells and host-mediated effects are involved in this phenomenon.","['Ferrantini, M', 'Belardelli, F', 'Locardi, C']","['Ferrantini M', 'Belardelli F', 'Locardi C']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology/*physiology', 'Interferon Type I/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenotype', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.62.2.600-605.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1988 Feb;62(2):600-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.62.2.600-605.1988.,,,,,,PMC250574,,,

Much has been learned regarding the diagnosis, natural history, biology, and treatment of this unique neoplasm. The disease most commonly affects middle aged men and characteristic clinical features include splenomegaly, cytopenias, and usually the presence in the peripheral blood of distinctive 'hairy cells' with irregular cytoplasmic projections. Diagnosis can usually be confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. Although the natural history can be extremely variable among patients, complications are usually referable to the cytopenias, with anemia and infection being most frequent. In addition to pyogenic infections, patients are susceptible to unusual organisms including atypical mycobacterium, legionella, and fungi. The requirement of red blood cell transfusion, severe granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia, frequent infections, or painful splenomegaly are all indications for treatment. Splenectomy is the standard initial treatment of choice. However, in the past few years there have been exciting major advances in the therapeutic modalities for HCL. Recombinant alpha-interferon is highly effective, with beneficial responses occurring in close to 90% of patients. The Food and Drug Administration has recently approved the use of interferon for HCL. This represents the first time a biological response modifier has been approved for the treatment of human disease. In addition, preliminary results with the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, 2'deoxycoformycin (dcf), have been encouraging. Further clinical trials are required in order to determine the optimal sequential treatment strategy for HCL. The exact mechanisms of action of both interferon and dcf in HCL remain to be elucidated. A better understanding of the unusual features of the hairy cell and the underlying biological effect of these two agents in HCL may have important applications in other hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies.","['Lembersky, B C', 'Golomb, H M']","['Lembersky BC', 'Golomb HM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, Illinois.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pentostatin', 'Splenectomy']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00144268 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1987;6(3):283-300. doi: 10.1007/BF00144268.,70,,,,,,,,

The survival probability of patients with initial levels of gammaglobulin of less than 700 mg/dl was significantly lower (P = 0.03) than in patients with initial levels of 700 mg/dl or more. Decreased initial levels of IgG and IgA also were associated with reduced survival probability (P = 0.027 and P = 0.014, respectively), whereas hypo-IgM did not show any influence on survival. When the influence on survival of gammaglobulin and immunoglobulin concentration was analyzed by Cox's multivariate model, the only variable which entered the regression at significant level was IgA (P = 0.006). As shown by the same type of analysis, the prognostic value of hypo-IgA is independent from the clinical staging. The natural history of hypogammaglobulinemia and hypoimmunoglobulinemia was investigated by sequential analysis in a series of untreated patients. The appearance of decreased levels of these globulins was found to be a continuous process developing spontaneously during the untreated course of the disease.

Colony formation in culture with methylcellulose detects principally terminal divisions, while growth of clonogenic cells in suspension reflects self-renewal. In a previous study different cytosine arabinoside and 5-azacytidine dose-response curves were obtained with the two assays. For the former the slope of the dose-response curve measured in suspension was steeper than that obtained using the clonogenic assay. For the latter, 5-azacytidine, the relationship between sensitivity in suspension and in methylcellulose was reversed. Further, for cytosine arabinoside, sensitivity in suspension but not in methylcellulose was associated with successful remission-induction. In this article we report an association between 5-azacytidine sensitivity in suspension and successful remission induction, for patients treated only with high-dose cytosine arabinoside. There was no correlation between the 5-azacytidine dose-response curve in methyl-cellulose and clinical outcome. A model is presented that may explain these findings, based on the hypothesis that there are genetic mechanisms responsible for blast cell renewal.","['Wang, C', 'Curtis, J E', 'Senn, J S', 'Tritchler, D L', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Wang C', 'Curtis JE', 'Senn JS', 'Tritchler DL', 'McCulloch EA']","['Division of Biological Research, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Methylcellulose', 'Middle Aged']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Nov;1(11):753-6.,,,,,,,,,

Recent papers have reported that leukemic cells differ from normal cells in having higher c-myc RNA levels. One problem in interpreting these data is that leukemic and normal cell populations differ in the proportion of immature cells present in each. The studies described here, using chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, compared the level of proto-oncogene expression in immature and mature myeloid cells. Substantial differences in the level and pattern of expression were found with the immature cells containing higher c-myc RNA levels and the mature cells containing higher histone H3 RNA levels. c-fos RNA levels parallel the distribution of monocytes. While the c-myc RNA level in the CML cell population as a whole is similar to that in normal marrow cell populations and less than that in the bone marrow cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), c-myc RNA levels in subpopulations of immature chronic phase CML myeloid cells approximate that found in AML cells. Additionally, the studies described here suggest that the presence of high c-myc and c-fos RNA levels in light density immature cells may be a unique characteristic of acute myeloid leukemic cells.","['Preisler, H D', 'Guan, W D', 'Khan, S', 'Kinniburgh, A']","['Preisler HD', 'Guan WD', 'Khan S', 'Kinniburgh A']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],['CA41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Female', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90138-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(10):923-34. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90138-x.,,,,,,,,,

Although this particular sequence contains no long open reading frames, computer searches have revealed several segments of amino acid homology with known retroviral gene products. In the gag region of RTVL-H2, there is a segment with significant homology to a region of the gag protein p30 of type C baboon endogenous virus. In the pol region of RTVL-H2, three segments similar to the Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) pol polyprotein were detected. These correspond to parts of the protease, reverse transcriptase, and endonuclease domains of the MLV pol gene. Interestingly, the last two pol domains are equidistant in RTVL-H2 and the type C murine retroviruslike DNA sequence (MuRRS), both having deletions of equal sizes relative to the MLV pol gene. One other segment similar to a retroviral gene product was identified in the RTVL-H2 gag region. This segment has 55 to 60% amino acid homology to a 50-amino-acid region of the gag nucleic acid-binding proteins encoded by human T-cell lymphotropic viruses types I and II and bovine leukemia virus.

The clinical courses and outcomes of five patients who received minimal or no chemotherapy were compared with that of four patients who were treated with intensive acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) combination chemotherapy. None of the five patients in the former group achieved clinical remission and their survivals were 1, 4, 4, 7, and 29 months, respectively. All four patients in the latter group achieved clinical remissions that lasted 11, 21, 21, and 27 + months, respectively. The durations of their survival (21, 26, 30, and 32 + months) were significantly better than the five patients who received minimal or no chemotherapy (P less than .05). Despite hospitalizations for chemotherapy and for treatment of chemotherapy-associated complications, the clinical status and quality of life of the children who achieved clinical remission were superior to those who remained in relapse. Although intensive chemotherapy induced lengthy remissions, three of the four patients have relapsed. Cytogenetic and cell culture data indicated that the monocytic-macrophage cells characteristic of JCML appeared to be suppressed during remission rather than totally eliminated. We recommend that ANLL-type combination chemotherapy be used as the initial treatment of JCML because of its promptness in effecting clinical remissions. Improved maintenance and consolidation protocols have to be developed to produce durable remissions and cures. Alternatively, bone marrow transplantation may be a useful option soon after remission is achieved with chemotherapy.","['Chan, H S', 'Estrov, Z', 'Weitzman, S S', 'Freedman, M H']","['Chan HS', 'Estrov Z', 'Weitzman SS', 'Freedman MH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.12.1960 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Dec;5(12):1960-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.12.1960.,,,,,,,,,

A gamma beta fusion gene containing gamma 5' sequences to the EcoRI site in exon 3 and beta sequences 3' is expressed at 10-40% that of the endogenous gamma level. In 50% of the lines, this fusion gene appropriately increases its expression in response to hemin, an inducer of endogenous globin gene expression in K562 cells. In contrast, a beta gamma fusion gene, containing beta sequences 5' to the EcoRI site in exon 3 and gamma sequences 3', is neither expressed nor correctly initiated. A beta gene containing gamma-intervening sequence (IVS) 2 accumulates an mRNA transcript when analyzed with a 3' beta probe. However, no correctly initiated beta mRNA is observed. A gamma gene with beta-IVS 2 is only inducible in one of six expressing clones.

To simplify and enhance the detection and phenotypic analysis of these cells, we sought to develop monoclonal antibodies to this enzyme. In order to obtain antibodies that bind a variety of mammalian TdTs, mice were immunized with bovine TdT and the hybridoma secretions were screened by immunofluorescence assays on cultured TdT-positive and negative human lymphoblasts. Four monoclonal antibodies which bound specifically to TdT-positive lymphoblasts were characterized in detail. All four antibodies immunoprecipitated the native 60 kd TdT molecule from extracts of TdT-positive human lymphoblasts and bound specifically in immunoblot assays to the 43.8 and 11 kd proteolytic fragments of bovine thymus TdT. To assess whether the antibodies bound to related or distinct epitopes on bovine TdT, we measured the displacement of radiolabeled antibody from the immobilized enzyme by an excess of unlabeled heterologous antibody. These studies revealed that three of the antibodies competed for the same determinant on bovine TdT, while one antibody reacted with a distinct epitope. Antibody binding to either epitope, however, partially inhibited the enzymatic activity of bovine TdT. Specificity for TdT was tested by immunofluorescence and competition radioimmunoassays. In these assays, the antibodies did not stain a variety of known TdT-negative human hematopoietic cells and cell lines. both normal and neoplastic, nor were the antibodies displaced from purified bovine TdT by extracts of these TdT-negative cells. These results confirmed the cross-reactivity of the antibodies with human and bovine TdT. To assess cross-reactivity with TdT from other species, extracts of rabbit, mouse, and rat thymus were prepared and shown to specifically displace the antibodies from bovine TdT. Thus, these antibodies bound to TdT derived from at least five mammalian species. To determine whether these antibodies could be used to detect small subpopulations of TdT-positive cells, mixtures of TdT-positive and negative cells were prepared and stained with fluorescein conjugates of the antibodies. When assayed by flow cytometry, a population of 1% TdT-positive cells was easily detectable.
