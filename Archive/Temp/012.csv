Cell surface engineering is a methodology in which the cell surface is tailored to modulate cellular function and interactions. In addition to genetic engineering of cell surface proteins, a wide array of robust, innovative and elegant approaches have been developed to selectively target the cell surface. In this review, we will introduce the leading strategies currently used in cell surface engineering including broadly reactive chemical ligations and physical associations as well as more controlled approaches as demonstrated in genetic, enzymatic and metabolic engineering. Prominent applications of these strategies for cell-based therapies will be highlighted including targeted cell death, control over stem cell fate, immunoevasion, blood transfusion and the delivery of cells to target tissues. Advances will be focused specifically on cells which are the most promising in generating cell-based therapeutics including red blood cells, white blood cells (lymphocytes, macrophages), stem cells (multipotent and pluripotent), islet cells, cancer cells, and endothelial cells.","['Abbina, Srinivas', 'Siren, Erika M J', 'Moon, Haisle', 'Kizhakkedathu, Jayachandran N']","['Abbina S', 'Siren EMJ', 'Moon H', 'Kizhakkedathu JN']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7688-7574'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171004,United States,ACS Biomater Sci Eng,ACS biomaterials science & engineering,101654670,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['bioconjugation', 'cell surface engineering', 'endothelial cells', 'islet cells', 'polymers', 'red blood cells', 'stem cells']",2018/11/12 00:00,2018/11/12 00:01,['2021/01/12 01:00'],"['2021/01/12 01:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/12 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00514 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Biomater Sci Eng. 2018 Nov 12;4(11):3658-3677. doi: 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00514.

However, a severe side effect induced by long-term GC therapy is osteoporosis. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) - a glycoprotein 130 (gp130) dependent cytokine and member of the interleukin-6 cytokine family - is an activator protein 1 (AP-1) target gene that may be involved in one of the mechanisms underlying GC-induced bone loss. Indeed, we previously reported that the mRNA expression level of LIF was enhanced upon osteogenic differentiation, but was significantly decreased in GC-treated osteoblasts. In this study, we show that in vitro LIF treatment rescues the decreased early osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of GC-treated osteoblasts. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that in vivo LIF treatment protects against GC-mediated trabecular bone loss by decreasing the loss of both trabecular bone formation and osteoblast numbers. This protection appears to be conferred by LIF rescuing GC decreased activity of Stat3, MAPK, and Akt signaling pathways. Thus, the specific targeting of LIF signaling may represent a new therapeutic strategy to prevent GC-induced trabecular bone loss.","['Lee, Sooyeon', 'Liu, Peng', 'Ahmad, Mubashir', 'Tuckermann, Jan P']","['Lee S', 'Liu P', 'Ahmad M', 'Tuckermann JP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210109,United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis', '*Glucocorticoids', '*Leukemia inhibitory factor', '*Osteoblast differentiation']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2021/01/11 20:10'],"['2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 20:10 [entrez]']","['S8756-3282(21)00005-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2021.115843 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2021 Apr;145:115843. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2021.115843.

The mode of action (MOA) for AML development leading to mortality is anticipated to include multiple earlier key events, which can be observed in hematotoxicity and genetic toxicity in peripheral blood of exposed workers. Prevention of these early events would lead to prevention of the apical, adverse outcomes, the morbidity and mortality caused by the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML. Incorporation of key event information should modify the risk model, but few modification approaches have been suggested. To that end, two approaches to risk model modification are described that use sub-linear and segmented linear increases in risk below key events, while maintaining a linear increase in AML mortality risk beginning at 2 ppm, the lowest observed adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) identified for hemato- and geno- toxicity in high quality studies of human occupational exposure. Below 2 ppm two different modification approaches to quantitative risk models were applied: a continuously decreasing slope model and a segmented modification in slope. These two approaches provide greater flexibility to incorporate MOA information in risk model development and selection.","['North, Colin M', 'Schnatter, A Robert', 'Rooseboom, Martijn', 'Aygun Kocabas, Neslihan', 'Dalzell, Abigail', 'Williams, Stephen D']","['North CM', 'Schnatter AR', 'Rooseboom M', 'Aygun Kocabas N', 'Dalzell A', 'Williams SD']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Benzene', 'Dose response modelling', 'Exposure response modelling', 'Genotoxicity', 'Hematotoxicity', 'Key event', 'Mortality', 'Occupational', 'Risk model']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2021/01/11 20:10'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 20:10 [entrez]']","['S0378-4274(21)00004-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2021.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2021 Apr 1;340:141-152. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2021.01.003.

Discovery of novel therapeutic agents has crucial importance for improvement of our medical management capabilities. Dysregulation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase pathway plays an important role in cancer progression, making this receptor an attractive molecular target for anticancer drug discovery. In this study, twenty-seven 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one C5 amide derivatives were synthesized and their cancer cell growth inhibitory activity was examined against MCF-7, HT-29 and MOLT-4 cells and also NIH/3T3 non-cancer cells by MTT assay. The antiproliferative effect of the most potent derivatives were tested against MET-dependent EBC-1 and MKN-45, lung and gastric cancer cell lines, respectively. MET kinase inhibition was measured by a Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) Assay. The influence of the test compounds on cell cycle was examined by RNase/PI flow cytometric assay. A number of compounds exhibited considerable antiproliferative effects against breast and colon cancer and leukemia cell lines, relatively sparing non-cancer cells. Some derivatives bearing benzothiazolyl carboxamide moiety at C5 position (15, 21, 23, 31, and 37) showed the highest activities with IC50 values as low as 10.9 muM. These compounds showed antiproliferative effects also against MET-amplified cells and dose-dependently inhibited MET kinase activity. They also induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest at lower doses and apoptosis at higher doses. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies confirmed the interaction of compound 23 with the active site of the MET receptor. These findings demonstrate that 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one analogues may represent promising targeted anticancer agents.","['Moosavi, Fatemeh', 'Ebadi, Ahmad', 'Mohabbati, Maryam', 'Damghani, Tahereh', 'Mortazavi, Motahareh', 'Miri, Ramin', 'Firuzi, Omidreza']","['Moosavi F', 'Ebadi A', 'Mohabbati M', 'Damghani T', 'Mortazavi M', 'Miri R', 'Firuzi O']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210109,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer drug', 'Drug design', 'Kinase inhibitor', 'Molecular modeling', 'Scaffold hopping']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/05/29 06:00,['2021/01/11 20:09'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 20:09 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(21)00003-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173850 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2021 Mar 5;894:173850. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173850.

One of the main sources of Rn which is directly consumed by the population is Groundwater (Tube well, Bore well, Hand pump). Rn gas is found naturally in rock, soil and water and can be considered as main health risk factor in terms of lung cancer, stomach diseases, leukemia and childhood cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration of Rn in the drinking water sources, appraisal of health risk for children in District Bannu, Pakistan. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Total of 98 drinking water samples were analyzed by using RAD-7 detector. The experimental data was statistically analyzed by using Pearson's test. The experimental and epidemiological data of the study area are shown on map using ArcGIS version 10.5. RESULTS: The analytical results show that Rn in drinking water was found varying from 10.1 Bq/l to 53.1 Bq/l with the average highest and lowest depth of 60 ft to 550 ft respectively. Pearson's test was used to show the concentration of Rn verses the depth of the water sources so +1 positive linear correlation was observed among the depth of water sources and the concentration of Rn. Out of 98 drinking water samples 40 sample were above the maximum contaminant level of 11.1 Bq/l (MCL) set by WHO, 2002. The effective doses (AED and DEing) for children ranges from 0.00001 to 3.792 mSv/y which exceeds the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of Rn (0.1mSv/y) in 30 drinking water samples . On the basis of analytical results Rn high concentration areas are shown on the map using IDW model of interpolation and health risks were shown in areas where Rn content was above the maximum contaminant level. High correlations of diseases related to Rn were observed amongst the residence of the study area. Gastrointestinal diseases, brain tumor, lung cancer and kidney diseases were observed among the children of the study area. CONCLUSION: From the overall analysis it was observed that high Rn concentration in drinking water may cause substantial health damage in children after long term exposure.","['Shakoor, Huma', 'Jehan, Noor', 'Khan, Sardar', 'Khattak, Nimat Ullah']","['Shakoor H', 'Jehan N', 'Khan S', 'Khattak NU']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5531-4400'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210315,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['RAD7', 'Radon', 'children', 'hazard mapping', 'health hazards', 'risk assessment']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2021/01/11 20:09'],"['2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 20:09 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553002.2021.1872817 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Radiat Biol. 2021 Mar 15:1-9. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2021.1872817.,,,"['Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old man with a history of CLL who had been treated with ibrutinib over 6 weeks developed a rash and progressive weakness, and he was ultimately admitted to the hospital for obtundation. He was hypotensive, hyponatremic, and hypothyroid. Despite extensive testing and treatment for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), he remained unimproved. Results of an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test indicated secondary adrenal insufficiency. He was treated with hydrocortisone, and his symptoms subsequently resolved. DISCUSSION: Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of endocrine dysfunction, such as adrenal insufficiency, thyroid dysfunction, hyperparathyroidism, and gonadal failure in some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). To our knowledge, no previous literature has reported this association specifically with the TKI ibrutinib. The case highlights the importance of spreading awareness amongst clinicians of potential side effects that can occur with targeted therapy such as ibrutinib. This, in turn, will facilitate prompt recognition and early management when such cases arise in a hospital setting.","['Chandrashekar, Nikhitha', 'McKenney, Rachel']","['Chandrashekar N', 'McKenney R']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,WMJ,WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,9716054,IM,,,2021/01/12 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/01/11 17:12'],"['2021/01/11 17:12 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,WMJ. 2020 Dec;119(4):293-295.,20211028,"['Copyright(c) Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and The', 'Medical College of Wisconsin, Inc.']","['Department of Medical Education, Gundersen Health System, La Crosse, Wisconsin, NChandra@gundersenhealth.org.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Gundersen Health System, La Crosse, Wisconsin.']","['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']","['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Piperidines', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects', 'United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study subjects comprised 2254 children (0-14 years) and 2,905 AYAs (15-39 years) who were diagnosed with leukemia during 1975-2011. Leukemia was divided into four types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and other leukemias. We analyzed 5-year overall survival probability (5y-OS), using the Kaplan-Meier method and expressed time trends using the joinpoint regression model. For recently diagnosed (2006-2011) patients, a Cox proportional hazards model was applied to determine predictors of 5y-OS, using age group, gender, and treatment hospital as covariates. Over the 37-year period, 5y-OS greatly improved among both children and AYAs, for each leukemia type. Among AYAs, 5y-OS of ALL improved, especially after 2000 (65% in 2006-2011), when the pediatric regimen was introduced but was still lower than that among children (87% in 2006-2011, P < .001). Survival improvement was most remarkable in CML, and its 5y-OS was over 90% among both children and AYAs after the introduction of molecularly targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Among patients with recently diagnosed AML, the risk of death was significantly higher for patients treated at nondesignated hospitals than those treated at designated cancer care hospitals. The changes in survival improvement coincided with the introduction of treatment regimens or molecularly targeted therapies. Patient centralization might be one option which would improve survival.","['Nakata, Kayo', 'Okawa, Sumiyo', 'Fuji, Shigeo', 'Sato, Akira', 'Morishima, Toshitaka', 'Tada, Yuma', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Kawa, Keisei', 'Miyashiro, Isao']","['Nakata K', 'Okawa S', 'Fuji S', 'Sato A', 'Morishima T', 'Tada Y', 'Inoue M', 'Hara J', 'Kawa K', 'Miyashiro I']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9782-8637', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2197-7078', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0747-3287', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6798-1558']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210203,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['adolescents and young adults', 'children', 'epidemiology', 'leukemia', 'survival']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2021/01/11 17:12'],"['2020/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14808 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Mar;112(3):1150-1160. doi: 10.1111/cas.14808.

Immunosuppressive drugs, such as anti-thymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, and post-transplant cyclophosphamide, have been used to prevent graft-versus-host disease in HLA-mismatched haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here, we investigated whether these drugs could ameliorate graft-versus-host disease without diminishing the graft-versus-leukemia effect by using a xenogeneic transplanted graft-versus-host disease/graft-versus-leukemia model. Anti-thymocyte globulin treatment diminished graft-versus-host disease symptoms, completely depleted the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver and intestine, and led to prolonged survival. By contrast, improvement after post-transplant cyclophosphamide treatment remained minimal. Alemtuzumab treatment modestly prolonged survival despite an apparent decrease of Tregs. In the graft-versus-leukemia model, 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg of anti-thymocyte globulin and 0.6 to 0.9 mg/kg of alemtuzumab reduced graft-versus-host disease with minimal loss of graft-versus-leukemia effect. Mice treated with 400 mg/kg of post-transplant cyclophosphamide did not develop graft-versus-host disease or leukemia, but it was difficult to evaluate the graft-versus-leukemia effect due to the sensitivity of A20 cells to cyclophosphamide. Although the current settings provide narrow optimal therapeutic windows, further studies are warranted to maximize the benefits of each immunosuppressant.","['Mashima, Kiyomi', 'Oh, Iekuni', 'Fujiwara, Ken', 'Izawa, Junko', 'Takayama, Norihito', 'Nakano, Hirofumi', 'Kawasaki, Yasufumi', 'Minakata, Daisuke', 'Yamasaki, Ryoko', 'Morita, Kaoru', 'Ashizawa, Masahiro', 'Yamamoto, Chihiro', 'Hatano, Kaoru', 'Sato, Kazuya', 'Ohmine, Ken', 'Fujiwara, Shin-Ichiro', 'Ohno, Nobuhiko', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Mashima K', 'Oh I', 'Fujiwara K', 'Izawa J', 'Takayama N', 'Nakano H', 'Kawasaki Y', 'Minakata D', 'Yamasaki R', 'Morita K', 'Ashizawa M', 'Yamamoto C', 'Hatano K', 'Sato K', 'Ohmine K', 'Fujiwara SI', 'Ohno N', 'Kanda Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4736-3285'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210111,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/01/12 06:00,2021/05/12 06:00,['2021/01/11 17:11'],"['2020/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 17:11 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0245232 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-18979 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Jan 11;16(1):e0245232. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0245232. eCollection 2021.,20210511,,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Histology and Cell Biology, Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Histology and Cell Biology, Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.']","['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']","['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tumor Burden']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC7799789,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to determine the function and mechanism of action of TPT1-AS1 in the progression and metastasis of CRC. Elevated TPT1-AS1 levels were observed in CRC tissues. Furthermore, the high expression levels were found to be correlated with unfavourable clinicopathological characteristics in CRC. Cell function experiments demonstrated that TPT1-AS1 depletion impeded cell proliferation, migration and invasion and enhanced cell adhesion; it also attenuated tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Additionally, TPT1-AS1 was predominately located in the nuclei of the cells and could upregulate the expression of TPT1 by recruiting mixed lineage leukaemia protein-1 (MLL1), which increased the trimethylation of H3K4 me3 in the TPT1 promoter region and subsequently activated FAK and JAK-STAT3 signalling cascades. The inhibition of FAK activation by PF573228 significantly attenuated the oncogenic effect of TPT1-AS1. These findings indicated that TPT1-AS1 promoted tumour progression and metastasis in CRC by upregulating TPT1 levels and activating the FAK and JAK-STAT3 signalling pathways. Thus, TPT1-AS1 may be considered as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.","['Zhang, Leiyi', 'Ye, Fei', 'Zuo, Zhongkun', 'Cao, Ding', 'Peng, Yu', 'Li, Zedong', 'Huang, Jiangsheng', 'Duan, Lunxi']","['Zhang L', 'Ye F', 'Zuo Z', 'Cao D', 'Peng Y', 'Li Z', 'Huang J', 'Duan L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210110,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*TPT1', '*colorectal cancer', '*long noncoding RNA', '*metastasis', '*tumour protein translationally controlled 1 antisense RNA 1']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/01/11 17:10'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 17:10 [entrez]']","['202339 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.202339 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2021 Jan 10;13(3):3779-3797. doi: 10.18632/aging.202339.

TKIs provided a significant improvement in terms of survival rates and disease-free period in CML; however, there is insufficient knowledge about their side effects, including reproductive toxicity. Since nearly half of the CML patients are in their reproductive age, and newly announced indications cover the treatment of the paediatric age groups, concerns arise about the effects of these drugs on the reproductive system, as there are no controlled preclinical studies. We investigated acute and long-term gonadotoxic and teratogenic effects of nilotinib, utilising a mouse model that simulates various clinical scenarios. We observed significant testicular damage in mice receiving nilotinib according to Johnsen's score analysis. Alterations were observed in female mice's number of follicles, as the primordial follicle numbers significantly decreased. Proliferating cell number in both genders' gonads decreased and apoptosis rate increased significantly. The nilotinib-received female and male mice's pregnancy rates were low compared to controls. A significant decrease in the thickness of the spongiotrophoblast and decidual layers of the placenta was detected in pregnancies consisting of male and/or female mice treated with nilotinib. The results of this study establish a critical point of view for clinical translation and indicate the importance of consulting patients for directing them to fertility preservation and contraception options for both genders before nilotinib treatment.","['Ozkavukcu, Sinan', 'Kuscu, Nilay', 'Adiguzel, Dileyra', 'Cengiz-Seval, Guldane', 'Celik-Ozenci, Ciler']","['Ozkavukcu S', 'Kuscu N', 'Adiguzel D', 'Cengiz-Seval G', 'Celik-Ozenci C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4525-9027'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,IM,,,2021/01/12 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/01/11 17:10'],"['2020/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 17:10 [entrez]']","['10.1530/REP-20-0548 [doi]', 'REP-20-0548 [pii]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2021 Mar;161(3):295-306. doi: 10.1530/REP-20-0548.,20220113,,"['Department of Histology and Embryology, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Center for Assisted Reproduction, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.']","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/toxicity', '*Pyrimidines/toxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a matricellular protein it is mainly considered to be active as a modifier of signaling activity of several different signaling pathways and as an orchestrator of their cross-talk. Furthermore, CCN2 and its fragments have been implicated in the regulation of a multitude of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, cell survival, apoptosis and the production of extracellular matrix products, as well as in more complex processes such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, fibrosis, mechanotransduction and inflammation. Its function is complex and context dependent, depending on cell type, state of differentiation and microenvironmental context. CCN2 plays a role in many diseases, especially those associated with fibrosis, but has also been implicated in many different forms of cancer. In the bone marrow (BM), CCN2 is highly expressed in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). CCN2 is important for MSC function, supporting its proliferation, migration and differentiation. In addition, stromal CCN2 supports the maintenance and longtime survival of hematopoietic stem cells, and in the presence of interleukin 7, stimulates the differentiation of pro-B lymphocytes into pre-B lymphocytes. Overexpression of CCN2 is seen in the majority of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias, especially in certain cytogenetic subgroups associated with poor outcome. In acute myeloid leukemia, CCN2 expression is increased in MSCs, which has been associated with leukemic engraftment in vivo. In this review, the complex function of CCN2 in the BM microenvironment and in normal as well as malignant hematopoiesis is discussed. In addition, an overview is given of data on the remaining CCN family members regarding normal and malignant hematopoiesis, having many similarities and some differences in their function.","['Leguit, Roos J', 'Raymakers, Reinier A P', 'Hebeda, Konnie M', 'Goldschmeding, Roel']","['Leguit RJ', 'Raymakers RAP', 'Hebeda KM', 'Goldschmeding R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210111,Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow', 'CCN2', 'CTGF', 'Connective tissue growth factor', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemogenesis']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 12:20'],"['2020/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]', '2021/01/11 12:20 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12079-020-00602-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12079-020-00602-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2021 Mar;15(1):25-56. doi: 10.1007/s12079-020-00602-2.

Up-regulation of its expression promotes tumor development and chemotherapy resistance through a variety of mechanisms, and non-coding RNA can regulate to promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and inhibit cancer cell apoptosis.","['Wen, Bin', 'Wei, Ying-Ting', 'Zhao, Kui']","['Wen B', 'Wei YT', 'Zhao K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1639-0918'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210111,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA', 'High mobility group-box 3', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha', 'Tumor', 'microRNA']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2021/01/11 12:19'],"['2020/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 12:19 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-020-04015-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-020-04015-y [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2021 Apr;476(4):1729-1739. doi: 10.1007/s11010-020-04015-y.

However, inclusion of integrated genetic data into classification schema is still far from a reality. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent insights into the prevalence, pathogenic role, clonal architecture, prognostic impact and therapeutic management of genetic alterations across the spectrum of myeloid malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent multiomic-studies, including analysis of genetic alterations at the single-cell resolution, have revealed a high heterogeneity of lesions in over 200 recurrently mutated genes affecting disease initiation, clonal evolution and clinical outcome. Artificial intelligence and specifically machine learning approaches have been applied to large cohorts of AML and MDS patients to define in an unbiased manner clinically meaningful disease patterns including, disease classification, prognostication and therapeutic vulnerability, paving the way for future use in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Integration of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and clinical data coupled to conventional and machine learning approaches will allow refined leukaemia classification and risk prognostication and will identify novel therapeutic targets for these still high-risk leukaemia subtypes.","['Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Iacobucci I', 'Mullighan CG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,,2021/01/12 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/01/11 12:17'],"['2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 12:17 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000629 [doi]', '00062752-202103000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2021 Mar 1;28(2):101-109. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000629.,20210810,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Acalabrutinib is an orally available, highly selective, next-generation inhibitor of BTK. Based on the results of two key phase 3 trials (ELEVATE-TN in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and ASCEND in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL), which demonstrated superior progression-free survival while maintaining favorable tolerability, acalabrutinib was granted US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2019 for the treatment of patients with CLL. Acalabrutinib appears to offer similar efficacy but a significantly improved tolerability profile to first-generation agents. Acalabrutinib is a good candidate to combine with other anti-cancer therapies, including B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, a factor that may help to further improve clinical outcomes in CLL.","['Ghia, Paolo', 'Dlugosz-Danecka, Monika', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Jurczak, Wojciech']","['Ghia P', 'Dlugosz-Danecka M', 'Scarfo L', 'Jurczak W']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3750-7342', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8927-4125', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0844-0989', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1879-8084']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210111,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acalabrutinib', '*BTK inhibitor', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2021/01/11 12:14'],"['2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1864352 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 May;62(5):1066-1076. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1864352.

METHODS: Extensive collaboration between statisticians and clinical investigators revealed the need to incorporate several adaptive features into the design, including the flexibility of adding or eliminating certain dose combinations based on safety criteria applied to multiple dose pairs. During the design stage, additional dose levels of vinblastine were added, increasing the dimension of the drug combination space and thus the complexity of the problem. Increased complexity made application of existing drug combination dose-finding methods unsuitable in their current form. RESULTS: Our solution to these challenges was to adapt a method based on isotonic regression to meet the research objectives of the study. Application of this adapted method is described herein, and a simulation study of the design's operating characteristics is conducted. CONCLUSION: The aim of this article is to bring to light examples of novel design applications as a means of augmenting the implementation of innovative designs in the future and to demonstrate the flexibility of adaptive designs in satisfying changing design conditions.","['Wages, Nolan A', 'Reed, Daniel R', 'Keng, Michael K', 'Conaway, Mark R', 'Petroni, Gina R']","['Wages NA', 'Reed DR', 'Keng MK', 'Conaway MR', 'Petroni GR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2190-4864'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210110,England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Dose-finding', '*drug combination', '*phase I']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2021/01/11 08:40'],"['2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 08:40 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1740774520983484 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Trials. 2021 Jun;18(3):314-323. doi: 10.1177/1740774520983484.

We employed targeted next-generation sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism array for 89 patients with ATLL in Okinawa, the southernmost islands in Japan, where the frequency of HTLV-1 tax subgroup-A (HTLV-1-taxA) is notably higher than that in mainland Japan, where most ATLL cases have HTLV-1-taxB, and compared the results with previously reported genomic landscapes of ATLL in mainland Japan and the USA. Okinawan patients exhibited similar mutation profiles to mainland Japanese patients, with frequent alterations in TCR/NF-kB (eg, PRKCB, PLCG1, and CARD11) and T-cell trafficking pathways (CCR4 and CCR7), in contrast with North American patients who exhibited a predominance of epigenome-associated gene mutations. Some mutations, especially GATA3 and RHOA, were detected more frequently in Okinawan patients than in mainland Japanese patients. Compared to HTLV-1-taxB, HTLV-1-taxA was significantly dominant in Okinawan patients with these mutations (GATA3, 34.1% vs 14.6%, P = .044; RHOA, 24.4% vs 6.3%, P = .032), suggesting the contribution of viral strains to these mutation frequencies. From a clinical viewpoint, we identified a significant negative impact of biallelic inactivation of PRDM1 (P = .027) in addition to the previously reported PRKCB mutations, indicating the importance of integrated genetic analysis. This study suggests that heterogeneous genetic abnormalities in ATLL depend on the viral strain as well as on the ethnic background. This warrants the need to develop therapeutic interventions considering regional characteristics.","['Sakihama, Shugo', 'Morichika, Kazuho', 'Saito, Rumiko', 'Miyara, Megumi', 'Miyagi, Takashi', 'Hayashi, Masaki', 'Uchihara, Junnosuke', 'Tomoyose, Takeaki', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Nakayama, Shingo', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Sakai, Kazuko', 'Nishio, Kazuto', 'Masuzaki, Hiroaki', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Karube, Kennosuke']","['Sakihama S', 'Morichika K', 'Saito R', 'Miyara M', 'Miyagi T', 'Hayashi M', 'Uchihara J', 'Tomoyose T', 'Ohshiro K', 'Nakayama S', 'Nakachi S', 'Morishima S', 'Sakai K', 'Nishio K', 'Masuzaki H', 'Fukushima T', 'Karube K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2411-2539', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-4271', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1822-2720', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8275-0846', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2445-1047', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-858X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210131,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'geographical mutation heterogeneity', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type I', 'integrated clinico-genetic analysis', 'tax subgroup']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2021/01/11 05:47'],"['2020/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 05:47 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14806 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Mar;112(3):1300-1309. doi: 10.1111/cas.14806.

Once injured, skeletal muscles usually go through the processes of inflammation, repairing and remodeling. If repairing and remodeling stages are out of balance, scars will be formed to replace injured skeletal muscles. At present, clinicians usually use conventional methods to restore the injured skeletal muscles, such as flap transplantation. However, flap transplantation sometimes needs to sacrifice healthy autologous tissues and will bring extra harm to patients. In recent years, stem cells-based tissue engineering provides us new treatment ideas for skeletal muscle injuries. Stem cells are cells with multiple differentiation potential and have ability to differentiate into adult cells under special condition. Skeletal muscle tissues also have stem cells, called satellite cells, but they are in small amount and new muscle fibers that derived from them may not be enough to replace injured fibers. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) could promote musculoskeletal tissue regeneration and activate the myogenic differentiation of satellite cells. Biomaterial is another important factor to promote tissue regeneration and greatly enhance physiological activities of stem cells in vivo. The combined use of stem cells and biomaterials will gradually become a mainstream to restore injured skeletal muscles in the future.

Recent reports on PSCs shed light on the pluripotent hierarchy of stem cells and have promoted the exploration of new stem cell states along with their culture systems. Human naive PSCs are expected to provide further knowledge of early developmental mechanisms and improvements for differentiation programmes in the regenerative therapy of conventionally primed PSCs. However, practical challenges exist in using naive-state PSCs such as determining the conditions for hypoxic culture condition and showing limited stable cellular proliferation. Here, we have developed new leukemia inhibitory factor dependent PSCs by applying our previous work, the combination of dibenzazepine and a DOT1L inhibitor to achieve the stable culture of naive-state PSCs. The potential of these cells to differentiate into all three germ layers was shown both in vitro and in vivo. Such new naive-state PSCs formed dome-shaped colonies at a faster rate than conventional, primed-state human induced PSCs and could be maintained for an extended period in the absence of hypoxic culture conditions. We also identified relatively high expression levels of naive cell markers. Thus, non-hypoxia treated, leukemia inhibitory factor-dependent PSCs are anticipated to have characteristics similar to those of naive-like PSCs, and to enhance the utility value of PSCs. Such naive PSCs may allow the molecular characterization of previously undefined naive human PSCs, and to ultimately contribute to the use of human pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine and disease modelling.","['Isono, Wataru', 'Kawasaki, Tomoyuki', 'Ichida, Justin K', 'Ayabe, Takuya', 'Hiraike, Osamu', 'Umezawa, Akihiro', 'Akutsu, Hidenori']","['Isono W', 'Kawasaki T', 'Ichida JK', 'Ayabe T', 'Hiraike O', 'Umezawa A', 'Akutsu H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200902,Netherlands,Regen Ther,Regenerative therapy,101709085,,['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'Naive', 'Non-hypoxia', 'Pluripotent stem cell', 'Primed']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:43'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.reth.2020.08.001 [doi]', 'S2352-3204(20)30066-3 [pii]']",epublish,Regen Ther. 2020 Sep 2;15:161-168. doi: 10.1016/j.reth.2020.08.001. eCollection 2020 Dec.,,"['(c) 2020 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

The purpose of this review was to investigate the unmet supportive care needs of patients with hematological malignancies during and after active treatment as well as the factors that affect them. A systematic bibliographic search was carried out in the PubMed database for English articles published between 2009 and 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines and under the terms: ""unmet needs"", ""supportive care"", ""hematological malignancy"" and ""hematological cancer."" Twenty studies were evaluated and reviewed. Hierarchical frequently reported unmet supportive care needs were informational, emotional, physical, daily living/practical (accessibility, transportation, and financial problems), and family life/relational needs. In particular, patients with multiple myeloma most frequently reported unmet needs at the informational, physical, emotional, and daily living/practical domain. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes reported physical, emotional, practical, and relational needs. Patients with leukemia and lymphoma rated their needs as informational, physical, psychological, daily living, and sexual. Sexual and spiritual unmet needs were reported at a low level. Predictive indicators for increased unmet supportive care needs were the type of the hematological malignancy, younger age, marital status, female gender, monthly income, coexistence of anxiety and depression, and altered quality of life. To conclude with, the literature reports a significant number of unmet supportive care needs in patients with hematological malignancies, whose frequency and intensity were influenced by a variety of factors. However, the large heterogeneity of studies (design, sample, and needs assessment tools) makes the generalization of the results difficult.","['Tsatsou, Ioanna', 'Konstantinidis, Theocharis', 'Kalemikerakis, Ioannis', 'Adamakidou, Theodoula', 'Vlachou, Eugenia', 'Govina, Ourania']","['Tsatsou I', 'Konstantinidis T', 'Kalemikerakis I', 'Adamakidou T', 'Vlachou E', 'Govina O']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201015,United States,Asia Pac J Oncol Nurs,Asia-Pacific journal of oncology nursing,101673157,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematological cancers', 'hematological malignancies', 'supportive care', 'unmet needs']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:43'],"['2020/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/apjon.apjon_41_20 [doi]', 'APJON-8-5 [pii]']",epublish,Asia Pac J Oncol Nurs. 2020 Oct 15;8(1):5-17. doi: 10.4103/apjon.apjon_41_20. eCollection 2021 Jan-Feb.,,['Copyright: (c) 2020 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

The DNA damage response (DDR) orchestrates a molecular network of cellular mechanisms that integrates cell cycle regulation and DNA repair or apoptosis. Numerous studies have revealed that the DDR is activated by virus infection, aberrant DNA structures generated by viral DNA replication, or the integration of retroviruses. Although the DDR is an essential function for maintaining the genomic integrity of cells, viruses may utilize this mechanism to build a convenient environment for themselves, and the resulting perturbation of the DDR has been shown to increase the risk of tumorigenesis. There have been many studies investigating the roles of the DDR in oncogenic viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

We propose human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) as an excellent model to advance CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technologies against actively expressing and latent retroviral proviruses. HTLV-1 is a tumorigenic human retrovirus responsible for the development of both leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a neurological disease (HAM/TSP). The virus immortalizes and persists in CD4(+) T lymphocytes that survive for the lifetime of the host. The most important drivers of HTLV-1-mediated transformation and proliferation are the tax and hbz viral genes. Tax, transcribed from the plus-sense or genome strand, is essential for de novo infection and cellular immortalization. Hbz, transcribed from the minus-strand, supports proliferation and survival of infected cells in both its protein and mRNA forms. Abrogating the function or expression of tax and/or hbz by genome editing and mutagenic double-strand break repair may disable HTLV-1-infected cell growth/survival and prevent immune modulatory effects and ultimately HTLV-1-associated disease. In addition, the HTLV-1 viral genome is highly conserved with remarkable sequence homogeneity, both within the same host and even among different HTLV isolates. This offers more focused guide RNA targeting. In addition, there are several well-established animal models for studying HTLV-1 infection in vivo as well as cell immortalization in vitro. Therefore, studies with HTLV-1 may provide a better basis to assess and advance in vivo genome editing against retroviral infections.","['Panfil, Amanda R', 'Green, Patrick L', 'Yoder, Kristine E']","['Panfil AR', 'Green PL', 'Yoder KE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201223,Switzerland,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,101585359,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR', '*Hbz', '*Tax', '*human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', '*long terminal repeat', '*pathogenesis', '*retrovirus']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/06/11 06:00,['2021/01/11 05:41'],"['2020/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcimb.2020.580371 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2020 Dec 23;10:580371. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2020.580371. eCollection 2020.,20210610,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Panfil, Green and Yoder.']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.']","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']","['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', '*Gene Editing', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics']","['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI142794/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7785941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the aggressive phenotypes and relevant proteins were examined after Beclin 1 expression was altered in gastric cancer cells. We also observed the effects of Beclin 1 on gastric carcinogenesis using Becn1 knockout mice. Finally, clinicopathological significances of Beclin 1 expression were analyzed using meta- and bioinformatics analyses. Becn1 overexpression was found to inhibit proliferation, glucose metabolism, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, whereas its knockdown caused the opposite effects. Beclin 1 suppressed the tumor growth by decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis. The heterozygous abrogation of Becn1 in gastric pit, parietal and chief cells could not cause any epithelial lesion. Beclin 1-mediated chemoresistance was closely linked to the autophagy, Bax underexpression, and the overexpression of Bcl-2, LRP1, MDR1, and ING5. Bioinformatics analysis showed higher Becn1 mRNA expression in intestinal- than diffuse-type carcinomas (P<0.05), and in male than female gastric cancer patients (P<0.05). Becn1 hyperexpression was positively associated with both overall and progression-free survival rates of the cancer patients (P<0.05). Meta-analysis showed that down-regulated Beclin 1 expression in gastric cancer was positively with lymph node metastasis, TNM staging, dedifferentiation and poor prognosis (P<0.05). Becn1-related signal pathways in gastric cancer included prostate, lung, renal, colorectal, endometrial and thyroid cancers, glioma, and leukemia, the metabolism of amino acid, lipid and sugar, and some signal pathways of insulin, MAPK, TRL, VEGF, JAK-STAT, chemokine, p53, lysosome, peroxidome and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (P<0.05). These suggested that Beclin 1 might be considered as a potential marker of gastric carcinogenesis, aggressiveness and prognostic prediction, and as a target of gene therapy in gastric cancer.","['Zheng, Hua-Chuan', 'Zhao, Shuang', 'Xue, Hang', 'Zhao, En-Hong', 'Jiang, Hua-Mao', 'Hao, Chang-Lai']","['Zheng HC', 'Zhao S', 'Xue H', 'Zhao EH', 'Jiang HM', 'Hao CL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Beclin 1', 'aggressive behaviors', 'carcinogenesis', 'gastric cancer', 'gene therapy', 'prognosis']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:41'],"['2020/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.613679 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 23;10:613679. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.613679. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zheng, Zhao, Xue, Zhao, Jiang and Hao.']","['Department of Oncology and Experimental Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Oncology and Experimental Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Oncology and Experimental Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University, Jinzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7787063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in FLT3 are the most common genetic alteration in AML, identified in approximately one third of newly diagnosed patients. FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD) are associated with increased relapse and inferior overall survival. Multiple small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 signaling have been identified, two of which (midostaurin and gilteritinib) are currently approved in the United States, and many more of which are in clinical trials. Despite significant advances, resistance to FLT3 inhibitors through secondary FLT3 mutations, upregulation of parallel pathways, and extracellular signaling remains an ongoing challenge. Novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance, including combining FLT3 inhibitors with other antileukemic agents, development of new FLT3 inhibitors, and FLT3-directed immunotherapy are in active clinical development. Multiple questions regarding FLT3-mutated AML remain. In this review, we highlight several of the current most intriguing controversies in the field including the role of FLT3 inhibitors in maintenance therapy, the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation in FLT3-mutated AML, use of FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3 wild-type disease, significance of non-canonical FLT3 mutations, and finally, emerging concerns regarding clonal evolution.","['Kennedy, Vanessa E', 'Smith, Catherine C']","['Kennedy VE', 'Smith CC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201223,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'FLT3 inhibitor maintenance', 'FLT3 resistance', 'non-canonical FLT3 mutation']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:41'],"['2020/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.612880 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 23;10:612880. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.612880. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Kennedy and Smith.'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7787101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NAT10 is also a potential biomarker in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the mechanisms underlying NAT10's contribution to disease states and the effect of targeting NAT10 as a therapeutic target remain unclear. NAT10 was found to be highly expressed in patients with AML, and increased NAT10 expression was associated with poor outcomes. Additionally, targeting NAT10 via the shRNA knockdown and its pharmacotherapeutic inhibitor resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, and apoptosis in AML cells. Moreover, NAT10 induces cell cycle arrest by decreasing expression of CDK2, CDK4, CyclinD1, Cyclin E while simultaneously increasing the expression of p16 and p21. Targeting NAT10 induces ER stress through the increased expression of GRP78 and the cleavage of caspase 12, which are classical markers of ER stress. This triggered the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway by consequently increasing IRE1, CHOP, and PERK expression, all of which play crucial roles in the UPR pathway. Targeting NAT10 also activated the classical apoptotic pathway through the upregulation of the Bax/bak and the concurrent downregulation of Bcl-2. In summary, our data indicate that targeting NAT10 promotes ER stress, triggers the UPR pathway, and activates the Bax/Bcl-2 axis in AML cells. Our results thus indicate a novel mechanism underlying the induction of NAT10 inhibition-mediated apoptosis and reveal the potential for the therapeutic effect of a NAT10 specific inhibitor in AML.","['Zi, Jie', 'Han, Qi', 'Gu, Siyu', 'McGrath, Mary', 'Kane, Shriya', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Zi J', 'Han Q', 'Gu S', 'McGrath M', 'Kane S', 'Song C', 'Ge Z']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201217,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['N-acetyltransferase', 'NAT10', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'remodelin hydrobromide']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:41'],"['2020/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.598107 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 17;10:598107. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.598107. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zi, Han, Gu, McGrath, Kane, Song and Ge.']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA, United States.', 'Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7793641,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon, called cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR), has been demonstrated in many subsets of leukemia including B- and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B- and T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are surface molecules that allow cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. CAMs not only recognize ligands for binding but also initiate the intracellular signaling pathways that are associated with cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance upon binding to their ligands. Cadherins, selectins, and integrins are well-known cell adhesion molecules that allow binding to neighboring cells, ECM proteins, and soluble factors. The expression of cadherin, selectin, and integrin correlates with the increased drug resistance of leukemia cells. This paper will review the role of cadherins, selectins, and integrins in CAM-DR and the results of clinical trials targeting these molecules.","['Kim, Hye Na', 'Ruan, Yongsheng', 'Ogana, Heather', 'Kim, Yong-Mi']","['Kim HN', 'Ruan Y', 'Ogana H', 'Kim YM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201210,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow microenvironment', 'cell adhesion molecules', 'cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance', 'chemoresistance', 'leukemia']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:41'],"['2020/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.592733 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 10;10:592733. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.592733. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Kim, Ruan, Ogana and Kim.']","[""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Los Angeles, CA, United States.""]",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7793796,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim: To determine the long-term survival outcomes of treosulfan-based vs. busulfan-based conditioning regimens in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library were searched for studies published prior to December 6, 2019. The fixed-effects model was applied for overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD). Relapse incidence (RI) was pooled by the use of the random-effects model. Results: Six studies were included (3,982 patients; range, 57-1,956). The pooled HR for OS favored treosulfan (HR=0.80, 95%CI: 0.71-0.90). There was no significant difference in NRM between the two regimens (HR=0.84, 95%CI=0.71-1.01). There was no significant difference in LFS between the two regimens (HR=0.98, 95%CI=0.87-1.12). Treosulfan-based regimens showed a lower risk of aGvHD (HR=0.70, 95%CI=0.59-0.82), but there was no difference for cGvHD (HR=0.94, 95%CI=0.81-1.09). There was no significant difference in RI between the two regimens (HR=0.96, 95%CI=0.71-1.31). There was no publication bias among these studies. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis determined that treosulfan-based conditioning regimens could improve the OS in patients with MDS and AML, with lower acute graft-versus-host disease incidence, compared with busulfan-based regimens.","['Zhu, Sheng', 'Liu, Gang', 'Liu, Jing', 'Chen, Qiuying', 'Wang, Zhiqiang']","['Zhu S', 'Liu G', 'Liu J', 'Chen Q', 'Wang Z']",,['eng'],['Systematic Review'],20201216,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'busulfan', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'preconditioning regimen', 'treosulfan']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:41'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.591363 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 16;10:591363. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.591363. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhu, Liu, Liu, Chen and Wang.']","['Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of Xiangnan University, Chenzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Xiangnan University, Chenzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7793760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such cases present diagnostic and especially therapeutic challenges, making them of particular interest to study. We report a case of synchronic MCL and an esophageal tumor in an elderly male patient. Morphologically, the tumors were classified as splenic pleomorphic MCL and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus occurring concurrently. The pleomorphic MCL mimicked diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but lacked larger centroblast- or immunoblast-like cells. Curiously, both tumors overexpressed cyclin D1 by immunohistochemistry. This is an important feature that distinguishes MCL pathologically from two of its closest entities in the differential diagnosis: chronic lymphocytic leukemia and DLBCL, the latter of which mantle cells cannot transform into. The lymphoproliferation revealed IGH/CCND1 translocation by FISH, but the esophageal adenocarcinoma only showed CCND1 aneuploidy without break-apart signals. Since the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a common site of extranodal involvement by MCL and lymphomatous polyposis can present as GI polyps, adequate care was taken to differentiate the esophageal adenocarcinoma from advanced stagings of MCL, as well as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Despite numerous immunohistochemical stainings studied, only BCL1 was demonstrated to have partial overlap in both tumors. The patient underwent esophagectomy and splenectomy. A subsequent metastatic primary lung squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed, after which the patient expired. MCL typically presents at an advanced stage and has been deemed incurable with a prognosis of only several years. It is unclear whether the patient succumbed to complications of his MCL or the metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, he was lost to follow-up for a year and only received treatment after his third cancer was diagnosed. We have reviewed previous reports of synchronic mantle cell lymphoma and other solid tumors or hematological malignancies in the literature.","['Dabrowski, Dominik', 'Silva, Roberto F', 'Constantinescu, Michael', 'Shackelford, Rodney E', 'Dela Cruz, Nestor', 'Wei, Eric X']","['Dabrowski D', 'Silva RF', 'Constantinescu M', 'Shackelford RE', 'Dela Cruz N', 'Wei EX']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5824-867X'],['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201221,United States,Case Rep Oncol Med,Case reports in oncological medicine,101581035,,,,2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:40'],"['2020/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:40 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8888829 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Oncol Med. 2020 Dec 21;2020:8888829. doi: 10.1155/2020/8888829. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Dominik Dabrowski et al.'],"['Department of Pathology and Translational Pathobiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Translational Pathobiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Overton Brooks Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Shreveport, LA 71101, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Translational Pathobiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Translational Pathobiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Translational Pathobiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.']",,,"['The authors declare there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication', 'of this paper.']",,,PMC7772033,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, agents that inhibit ROS generation in AML should be exploited. Azelaic acid (AZA), a small molecular compound, can scavenge ROS and other free radicals, exerting antitumor effects on various tumor cells. Herein, this study evaluated the antileukemic activity of AZA against AML via regulation of the ROS signaling pathway. We found that AZA reduced intracellular ROS levels and increased total antioxidant capacity in AML cell lines and AML patient cells. AZA suppressed the proliferation of AML cell lines and AML patient cells, expending minimal cytotoxicity on healthy cells. Laser confocal microscopy showed that AZA-treated AML cells surged and ruptured gradually on microfluidic chips. Additionally, AZA promoted AML cell apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Further analysis demonstrated that peroxiredoxin (Prdx) 2 and Prdx3 were upregulated in AZA-treated AML cells. In vivo, AZA prolonged survival and attenuated AML by decreasing CD33(+) immunophenotyping in the bone marrow of a patient-derived xenograft AML model. Furthermore, mice in the AZA-treated group had an increased antioxidant capacity and Prdx2/Prdx3 upregulation. The findings indicate that AZA may be a potential agent against AML by regulating the Prdxs/ROS signaling pathway.","['Zhang, Dongdong', 'Luo, Ziyi', 'Jin, Yanxia', 'Chen, Yanling', 'Yang, Tian', 'Yang, Qian', 'Wu, Balu', 'Shang, Yufeng', 'Liu, Xiaoyan', 'Wei, Yongchang', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Zhang D', 'Luo Z', 'Jin Y', 'Chen Y', 'Yang T', 'Yang Q', 'Wu B', 'Shang Y', 'Liu X', 'Wei Y', 'Zhou F']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7611-3114', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1884-1484', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4777-2548', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3758-1465', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4557-9362', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7205-4663', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0982-0382']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,IM,,,2021/01/12 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/01/11 05:39'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/1295984 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2020 Dec 23;2020:1295984. doi: 10.1155/2020/1295984. eCollection 2020.,20210913,['Copyright (c) 2020 Dongdong Zhang et al.'],"['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', ""Department of Oncology, Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, Hubei 441000, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 4300071 Hubei Province, China.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Dicarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxin III)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'F2VW3D43YT (azelaic acid)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dicarboxylic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peroxiredoxin III/*metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,PMC7775164,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study selected data from 53 patients with HCC who had undergone hepatectomy in our hospital. The expressions of PLZF and MAPK10 in tumor tissues and normal tissues were compared and related clinical factors were analyzed. The clinical data including patient's gender, age, hepatitis B virus infection (HBV), alpha-fetoprotein levels (AFP), tumor size, TNM stage (AJCC), cirrhosis, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT), and OS (Overall survival) was collected. RESULTS: We found that PLZF expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC samples compared with that in adjacent non-tumor tissues (P=0.001). The expression level of PLZF was correlated with patients' gender (P=0.046), tumor stage (P=0.039), and OS (P=0.015). Moreover, the expression level of PLZF-MAPK10 (P-M protein) was correlated with gender (P=0.000) and tumor stage (P=0.045). Multivariate analyses showed that microsatellite nodules, PLZF, and P-M protein were independent risk factors of HCC prognosis. Postoperative patients with a normal expression level of PLZF and MAPK10 have a longer overall survival than those with abnormal levels (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: PLZF expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and itself and PLZF-MAPK10 were both independent prognostic factors for the OS of patients with HCC.","['Hu, Shanshan', 'Chen, Yue', 'Liu, Liheng', 'Yin, Xuedong', 'Yang, Yaying', 'Tang, Liping']","['Hu S', 'Chen Y', 'Liu L', 'Yin X', 'Yang Y', 'Tang L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase 10', 'prognosis', 'promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger protein', 'tumor suppressor genes']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:38'],"['2020/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:38 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2020 Dec 1;13(12):3158-3166. eCollection 2020.,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2020.'],"['Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Chongqing, China.']",,,['None.'],,,PMC7791377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HOTAIR, a long noncoding RNA (LncRNA), is involved in MDR development of various solid tumors. However, whether it functions in MDR development of leukemia remains unclear. In this study, expressions of HOTAIR in leukemia cell line K562/A02 and bone marrow samples from 10 patients with refractory and relapsed AML were detected by qRT-PCR. The apoptosis, proliferation, and susceptibility of K562/A02 cells to Adriamycin (ADR) were analyzed by flow cytometry and CCK8 assay, respectively. The expression of cell cycle regulator P21 and Notch1 in the K562/A02 cells was examined by qRT-PCR. The accumulation of total AKT and the phosphorylated AKT (pAKT(S473)) were detected by western blotting. We found that the expression of HOTAIR in drug-resistant cells and patient samples was increased. Inhibition of HOTAIR expression could suppress the proliferation, increase the apoptosis, and promote the doxorubicin sensitivity of K562/A02 cells. Moreover, inhibiting expression of HOTAIR could attenuate the expression of P21 and Notch1 and inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT in drug-resistant cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that LncRNA-HOTAIR is involved in MDR development of leukemia cells by regulating the expression of P21 and the AKT/Notch1 signaling pathway.","['Li, Mei-Ling', 'Wang, Yi', 'Xu, Yan-Ni', 'Lu, Quan-Yi']","['Li ML', 'Wang Y', 'Xu YN', 'Lu QY']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'LncRNA-HOTAIR', 'chemoresistance mechanism']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:38'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:38 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2020 Dec 1;13(12):3044-3051. eCollection 2020.,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2020.'],"['Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Duyun, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University Xiamen, Fujian, China.']",,,['None.'],,,PMC7791381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, about 10-20% of B-ALL patients exhibit primary resistance to murine-based CD19CAR-T (CD19mCAR-T). Herein, we report that a humanized selective CD19CAR-T (CD19hsCAR-T) may offer a solution to this problem. Case Description: A 10-year old boy was diagnosed with high-risk B-ALL in Mar., 2013, and relapsed in Oct., 2018, after he underwent haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2017. The patient then received haplo-identical CD19mCAR-T infusions twice following induction chemotherapy with Vincristine, Dexamethasone and Asparaginase (VDL), but no response was observed. We further treated this patient with CD19hsCAR-T following chemotherapy with Vindesine, Idarubicin, Dexamethasone, and Pegylated Asparaginase (VDLD) plus bortezomib. The patient achieved minimal residual disease-negative (MRDneg) complete remission with incomplete hematopoietic recovery (CRi), and remained in CRi for more than 8 months with manageable side effect. The patient, unfortunately, died of unidentified pulmonary infection on Jan. 25 2020. Conclusion: CD19hsCAR-T may have the potential to induce remission in patients who are primarily refractory to CD19mCAR-T.","['Wang, Kai', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Wang, Bin', 'Qin, Maoquan', 'Zhu,

The two main defining features of this late-onset condition are neutrophilic urticarial dermatoses (NUD) and the presence of an IgM monoclonal component. While the former aspect has been extensively studied in this disease setting, the enigmatic paraproteinaemia and its potential consequential effects within SchS, has not previously been thoroughly addressed. Previous studies analyzing clonal B cell repertoires have largely focused on autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE) and hematological malignancies such as Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), where B-cell clonality is central to disease pathology. The present study uses next-generation sequencing to provide detailed insight into aspects of B cell VDJ recombination and properties of the resulting immunoglobulin chains. An overview of IgH regional dynamics in 10 SchS patients, with a particular focus on CDR3 sequences and VDJ gene usage is reported, highlighting the presence of specific B cell expansions. Protein microarray detected a substantial proportion of autoreactive IgM to nuclear target proteins, though a single universal target was not identified.

However, ADA can exacerbate infectious conditions, induce paradoxical reactions such as inflammation, and cause neoplasia. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an infectious agent that induces inflammation and neoplastic infiltration in the eye. To date, numerous HTLV-1 carriers have been treated with adalimumab to suppress inflammation out of necessity, when standard anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids and immunosuppressive agents have proven inadequate to control the inflammation. Here, we clarify the safety of adalimumab for the eye under HTLV-1 infectious conditions in vitro. We used the adult retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE)-19 cell line as ocular resident cells, and used MT2 and TL-Om1 as HTLV-1-infected cells. ARPE-19 and MT2/TL-Om1 were co-cultured, and then adalimumab was administered. Production of cytokines and chemokines, TNF-alpha receptor (TNF-R), HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL), and apoptosis were measured to assess the effects of adalimumab. Contact between ARPE-19 and MT2/TL-Om1 produced inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10, and transduced chemokines such as interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG), and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). No inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were exacerbated by adalimumab. Expression of TNF-R on ARPE-19 and MT2/TL-Om1 cells, HTLV-1 PVLs of MT2/TL-Om1 cells, and cell growth rate and apoptotic rate of ARPE-19 were unaffected by adalimumab. In conclusion, adalimumab does not appear to exacerbate HTLV-1-associated inflammatory conditions in the eye or increase PVL in HTLV-1-infected T cells. These data suggest that adalimumab could be used safely for the eye under HTLV-1 infectious conditions from the perspective of in vitro assessment.","['Kurozumi-Karube, Hisako', 'Kamoi, Koju', 'Ando, Naoko', 'Uchida, Minami', 'Hamaguchi, Isao', 'Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko']","['Kurozumi-Karube H', 'Kamoi K', 'Ando N', 'Uchida M', 'Hamaguchi I', 'Ohno-Matsui K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1 uveitis', 'adalimumab', 'anti-TNF-alpha antibody', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', 'ocular infiltration', 'ocular inflammation', 'safety assessment', 'side effect']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:37'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.522579 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Dec 23;11:522579. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.522579. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Kurozumi-Karube, Kamoi, Ando, Uchida, Hamaguchi and', 'Ohno-Matsui.']","['Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7785715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes such as TPMT and NUDT15 have an outstanding role in 6-MP metabolism. Mutations in both genes explain a significant portion of hematological toxicities suffered by ALL Uruguayan pediatric patients. A variable number tandem repeat in the TPMT promoter (TPMT-VNTR) has been associated with TPMT expression. This VNTR has a conservative architecture (AnBmC). To explore new causes of hematological toxicities related to ALL therapy, we genotyped the TPMT-VNTR of 130 Uruguayan pediatric patients. Additionally, individual genetic ancestry was estimated by 45 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs). Hematological toxicity was measured as the number of leukopenia events and 6-MP dose along the maintenance phase. As previously reported, we found TPMT*2 and TPMT*3C alleles were associated to TPMT-VNTR A2BC and AB2C, respectively. However, contrasting with other reports, TPMT*3A allele was found in a heterogeneous genetic background in linkage equilibrium. Patients carrying more than 5 A repeats present a significant higher number of leukopenia events among patients without TPMT and/or NUDT15 variants. Native American ancestry and the number of A repeats were significantly correlated with the number of leukopenia events. However, the correlation between Native American ancestry and the number of leukopenia events was lost when the number of A repeats was considered as covariate. This suggests that TPMT-VNTR alleles are more relevant than Native American ancestry in the hematological toxicity. Our results emphasize that TPMT-VNTR may be used as a pharmacogenetic biomarker to predict 6-MP-related hematological toxicity in ALL childhood therapy.","['Burgueno-Rodriguez, Gabriela', 'Mendez, Yessika', 'Olano, Natalia', 'Dabezies, Agustin', 'Bertoni, Bernardo', 'Souto, Jorge', 'Castillo, Luis', 'da Luz, Julio', 'Soler, Ana Maria']","['Burgueno-Rodriguez G', 'Mendez Y', 'Olano N', 'Dabezies A', 'Bertoni B', 'Souto J', 'Castillo L', 'da Luz J', 'Soler AM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201109,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-MP', 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Ancestry', 'Hematological toxicity', 'NUDT15', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'TPMT', 'TPMT-VNTR']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:01,['2021/01/11 05:36'],"['2020/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:36 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2020.594262 [doi]', '594262 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Nov 9;11:594262. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.594262. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Burgueno-Rodriguez, Mendez, Olano, Dabezies, Bertoni, Souto,', 'Castillo, da Luz Pereira and Soler.']","['Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular Humana, Centro Universitario Regional (CENUR) Litoral Norte-Sede Salto, Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR), Salto, Uruguay.', 'Servicio Hemato Oncologico Pediatrico (SHOP), Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell (CHPR), Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Servicio Hemato Oncologico Pediatrico (SHOP), Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell (CHPR), Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Servicio Hemato Oncologico Pediatrico (SHOP), Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell (CHPR), Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Departamento de Genetica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Departamento de Genetica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Servicio Hemato Oncologico Pediatrico (SHOP), Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell (CHPR), Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular Humana, Centro Universitario Regional (CENUR) Litoral Norte-Sede Salto, Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR), Salto, Uruguay.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular Humana, Centro Universitario Regional (CENUR) Litoral Norte-Sede Salto, Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR), Salto, Uruguay.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationship that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7789872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the reports regarding risk factors of induction-related infection are roughly unknown/limited in adult T-ALL during induction chemotherapy. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study for the prevalence and risk predictors of induction-related infection among consecutive T-ALL patients (N = 97) enrolled in a PDT-ALL-LBL clinical trial. Of 97 patients with T-ALL enrolled in the trial, 46 were early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL and 51 were non-ETP ALL. Results: When compared with non-ETP, ETP ALL subtype was characterized with lower neutrophil count (1.35 x 10(9)/L vs. 8.7 x 10(9)/L, P < 0.001) and lower myeloid percentage in the bone marrow (13.35% vs. 35.31%, P = 0.007). Additionally, ETP ALL had longer neutropenia before diagnosis (P < 0.001), as well as during induction chemotherapy (P < 0.001). Notably, the ETP cohort experienced higher cumulative incidence of clinically documented infections (CDI; 33.33%, P = 0.001), microbiologically documented infections (MDI; 45.24%, P = 0.006), resistant infection (11.9%, P = 0.013), and mixed infection (21.43%, P = 0.003), respectively, than those of the non-ETP cohort. Furthermore, multivariable analysis revealed that T-ALL mixed infection was more likely related to chemotherapy response (OR, 0.025; 95% CI 0.127-0.64; P = 0.012) and identified myeloid percentage as a predictor associated with ETP-ALL mixed infection (OR, 0.915; 95% CI 0.843-0.993; P = 0.033), with ROC-defined cut-off value of 2.24% in ETP cohorts. Conclusions: Our data for the first time demonstrated that ETP-ALL characterized with impaired myelopoiesis were more susceptible to induction-related infection among T-ALL populations.","['Huang, Kangyu', 'Dai, Min', 'Li, Qiuli', 'Liu, Nannan', 'Lin, Dainan', 'Wang, Qiang', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Wang, Zhixiang', 'Gao, Ya', 'Jin, Hua', 'Liu, Xiaoli', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Zhou, Hongsheng']","['Huang K', 'Dai M', 'Li Q', 'Liu N', 'Lin D', 'Wang Q', 'Zhou X', 'Wang Z', 'Gao Y', 'Jin H', 'Liu X', 'Liu Q', 'Zhou H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7357-357X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2623-8394', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3513-5856']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,IM,,,2021/01/12 06:00,2021/09/22 06:00,['2021/01/11 05:35'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 05:35 [entrez]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8867760 [doi]'],epublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2020 Dec 23;2020:8867760. doi: 10.1155/2020/8867760. eCollection 2020.,20210921,['Copyright (c) 2020 Kangyu Huang et al.'],"['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Rd 1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Infections/*complications/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/*cytology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7775137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the comorbidities assessments and prognostic factors that predict outcomes for these patients. METHODS: Clinical data of patients older than 50 years who had received diagnoses of AML or MDS and underwent allo-HSCT were obtained. Information on patient characteristics, including age, gender, allogeneic transplant type, conditioning regimens, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or chronic GVHD, were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-five elderly patients with a median age at allo-HSCT of 57 years were included. The significant prognostic factors associated with worse overall survival (OS) were CCI >/=3 (hazard ratio: 1.88) and grade III-IV acute GVHD (3.18). Similar findings were noted in the non-relapse mortality analysis. To investigate the effects of chronic GVHD on patient outcomes, OS analysis was performed for those with survival >100 days after transplantation. The results revealed CCI >/=3 (1.88) and grade III-IV acute GVHD (2.73) remained poor prognostic factors for OS, whereas mild chronic GVHD (0.43) was associated with better OS. CONCLUSION: This cohort study suggests that CCI >/=3 predicts poor outcomes, primarily due to a higher NRM risk. Careful management of GVHD after transplantation could improve outcomes in elderly patients with AML or MDS after allo-HSCT.","['Chien, Sheng-Hsuan', 'Yao, Ming', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Chang, Ping-Ying', 'Yu, Ming-Sun', 'Huang, Cih-En', 'Tan, Tran-Der', 'Lin, Cheng-Hsien', 'Yeh, Su-Peng', 'Li, Sin-Syue', 'Wang, Po-Nan', 'Liu, Yi-Chang', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng']","['Chien SH', 'Yao M', 'Li CC', 'Chang PY', 'Yu MS', 'Huang CE', 'Tan TD', 'Lin CH', 'Yeh SP', 'Li SS', 'Wang PN', 'Liu YC', 'Gau JP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Charlson comorbidity index', 'Elderly adult', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome']",2021/01/12 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/11 05:27'],"['2020/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/11 05:27 [entrez]']","['S0929-6646(20)30621-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jfma.2020.12.021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2021 Dec;120(12):2144-2152. doi: 10.1016/j.jfma.2020.12.021.

MDS are driven by structural chromosomal alterations and somatic mutations in neoplastic myeloid cells, which are supported by a tumorigenic and a proinflammatory marrow microenvironment. Current treatment strategies for lower-risk MDS focus on improving quality of life and cytopenias, while prolonging survival and delaying disease progression is the focus for higher-risk MDS. Several promising drugs are in the horizon, including the hypoxia-inducible factor stabilizer roxadustat, telomerase inhibitor imetelstat, oral hypomethylating agents (CC-486), TP53 modulators (APR-246 and ALRN-6924), and the anti-CD47 antibody magrolimab. Targeted therapies approved for acute myeloid leukemia treatment, such as isocitrate dehdyrogenase inhibitors and venetoclax, are also being studied for use in MDS.

MRD can be detected by multiparametric flow cytometry, molecular approaches such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (IG/TR) gene rearrangements or fusion genes transcript, and high-throughput sequencing for IG/TR. Despite the proven clinical usefulness in detecting MRD, these methods have differences in sensitivity, specificity, applicability, turnaround time and cost. Knowing and understanding these differences, as well as the principles and limitations of each technology, is essential to laboratory standardization and correct interpretation of MRD results in line with treatment time points, therapeutic settings, and clinical trials. Here, we review the methodological approaches to measure MRD in ALL and discuss the advantages and limitations of the most commonly used techniques.","['Correia, Rodolfo P', 'Bento, Laiz C', 'de Sousa, Flavia A', 'Barroso, Rodrigo de S', 'Campregher, Paulo V', 'Bacal, Nydia S']","['Correia RP', 'Bento LC', 'de Sousa FA', 'Barroso RS', 'Campregher PV', 'Bacal NS']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4117-5988'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210110,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['MRD techniques', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'minimal residual disease']",2021/01/11 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2021/01/10 20:53'],"['2020/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/10 20:53 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13463 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Jun;43(3):354-363. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13463.

Here we report the outcome of allo-HSCT in a patient with ATL with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with HAM/TSP and started prednisolone therapy. Ten years later, he developed lymphoma-type ATL. At the diagnosis of ATL, Osame's Motor Disability Score (OMDS) was 4. When prednisolone was gradually tapered and stopped following chemotherapy for ATL, HAM/TSP symptoms recurred (OMDS 7). Bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen allele 8/8 matched unrelated donor was performed while ATL was in partial remission. Neutrophil engraftment with complete donor chimerism was achieved on day 19 after allo-HSCT. Mild gait improvement (OMDS 5) was observed on day 30. Although ATL relapsed on day 275, progression of HAM/TSP symptoms was not observed. Furthermore, there was no clear progression of HAM/TSP symptoms after donor lymphocyte infusions. The outcome of this case suggests that ATL patients with HAM/TSP tolerate allo-HSCT and donor lymphocyte infusions.","['Sakamoto, Hikaru', 'Itonaga, Hidehiro', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Kojima, Azusa', 'Chiwata, Masahiko', 'Fujioka, Machiko', 'Kitanosono, Hiroko', 'Horai, Makiko', 'Miyazaki, Teiichiro', 'Shiraishi, Hirokazu', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Sakamoto H', 'Itonaga H', 'Sawayama Y', 'Kojima A', 'Chiwata M', 'Fujioka M', 'Kitanosono H', 'Horai M', 'Miyazaki T', 'Shiraishi H', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Hata T', 'Yamano Y', 'Miyazaki Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1438-3623'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210110,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'HTLV-1-associated myelopathy']",2021/01/11 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2021/01/10 20:50'],"['2020/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/10 20:50 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-03075-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-03075-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 May;113(5):765-769. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-03075-6.

However, chemoresistance is observed in 20-30% of treated patients and represents a clinical challenge, raising the importance of the development of new therapeutic options. In the present study, the effects of three synthetic cyclopenta[b]indoles on the leukemia phenotype were investigated using NB4 (ATRA-sensitive) and NB4-R2 (ATRA-resistant) cells. Among the tested synthetic cyclopenta[b]indoles, compound 2, which contains a heterocyclic nucleus, was the most active, presenting time-dependent cytotoxic activity in the muM range in APL cells, without cytotoxicity for normal leukocytes, and was selected for further characterization. Compound 2 significantly decreased clonogenicity, increased apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases in a drug concentration-dependent manner. Morphological analyses indicated aberrant mitosis and diffuse tubulin staining upon compound 2 exposure, which corroborates cell cycle findings. In the molecular scenario, compound 2 reduced STMN1 expression and activity, and induced PARP1 cleavage and H2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation, and modulated CDKN1A, PMAIP1, GADD45A, and XRCC3 expressions, indicating reduction of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage. Moreover, in the in vivo tubulin polymerization assay, NB4 and NB4-R2 cells showed a reduction in the levels of polymerized tubulin upon compound 2 exposure, which indicates tubulin as a target of the drug. Molecular docking supports this hypothesis. Taken together, these data indicated that compound 2 exhibits antileukemic effects through disrupting the microtubule dynamics, identifying a possible novel potential antineoplastic agent for the treatment of ATRA-resistant APL.","['Vicari, Hugo Passos', 'Lima, Keli', 'Gomes, Ralph da Costa', 'Fernandes, Daniara Cristina', 'da Silva, Jean Carlos Lipreri', 'Rodrigues Junior, Manoel Trindade', 'Barroso de Oliveira, Aline Silva', 'Dos Santos, Ricardo Nascimento', 'Andricopulo, Adriano Defini', 'Coelho, Fernando', 'Costa-Lotufo, Leticia Veras', 'Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho']","['Vicari HP', 'Lima K', 'Gomes RDC', 'Fernandes DC', 'da Silva JCL', 'Rodrigues Junior MT', 'Barroso de Oliveira AS', 'Dos Santos RN', 'Andricopulo AD', 'Coelho F', 'Costa-Lotufo LV', 'Machado-Neto JA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Chemotherapy resistance', 'Microtubule dynamics', 'cyclopenta[b]indoles']",2021/01/11 06:00,2021/05/29 06:00,['2021/01/10 20:31'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/10 20:31 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(21)00006-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173853 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2021 Mar 5;894:173853. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173853.

The principal aim of this study was to analyze monthly variation of ALL diagnosis in a large homogenous Hispanic Latin American cohort over 15 years; its association with survival rates was also assessed. METHODS: Clinical files and electronic records of 501 consecutive patients of all ages with ALL in northeastern Mexico over the years of 2004-2018 were scrutinized. Patients were divided into children </=18 and adults >18 years. The Chi-square heterogeneity analysis was used to test for non-uniform variation. The Poisson regression analysis was used to fit sinusoidal (harmonic) models to the data, using the month of diagnosis as a covariate in a separate model. RESULTS: During the study period 363 children (72.5%) and 138 adults (27.5%) (p<0.001) were diagnosed with ALL. Heterogeneity across the months of diagnosis was confirmed (p=0.019) and the Poisson regression analysis confirmed a significant monthly variation (p<0.001) (95% CI, 3.024-3.745), a higher annual peak being observed in the month of March (p=0.002), followed by a second peak in October (p=0.026). The five-year OS for children was 68.2% (95% CI, 67.64-68.74) and for adults, 43.7% (95% CI, 42.67-44.71) (p<0.001). No significant association between the month of diagnosis and OS was found (p=0.789). CONCLUSION: The monthly variation of ALL diagnosis was documented; these results confirm the heterogeneous behavior of the disease and appear to be consistent with an interplay of environmental and biologic factors. Further studies are needed to examine putative candidate agents.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Hernandez-Coronado, Marcela', 'Hernandez-De Los Santos, Jose Antonio', 'Marfil-Rivera, Luis Javier', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Hernandez-Coronado M', 'Hernandez-De Los Santos JA', 'Marfil-Rivera LJ', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210103,Brazil,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,"Hematology, transfusion and cell therapy",101725732,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL time-trends', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Adult ALL', 'Childhood ALL']",2021/01/11 06:00,2021/01/11 06:00,['2021/01/10 20:31'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 20:31 [entrez]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S2531-1379(20)31313-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.htct.2020.10.965 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther. 2021 Jan 3. pii: S2531-1379(20)31313-4. doi: 10.1016/j.htct.2020.10.965.,,['Copyright (c) 2020.

C-kit is expressed in approximately 60% of patients with de novo AML and represents a potential therapeutic target. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed AML received 12 months of imatinib mesylate as maintenance therapy after the completion of post-remission therapy. The primary objective was to determine whether this approach improved progression-free survival (defined as no relapse and no death) compared with historical controls. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival of patients < 60 years of age was 52.1 months (historical control, 13 months) and for patients >/= 60 years of age was 10.7 months (historical control, 8 months). The median level of AF1q expression was high (9.59), and 84% of patients had moderate or high levels of drug-resistance factors.

Small RNAs (sRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), play a pivotal role in the initiation and development of hematological malignancies and may represent potential therapeutic target molecules. However, little is known about how these molecules impact the pathogenesis of ATLL. In this study, we aimed to identify sRNA expression signatures associated with ATLL and to investigate their potential implication in the pathophysiology of the disease. METHODS: Small-RNAseq analysis was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HTLV-1- associated ATLL (n = 10) in comparison to asymptomatic carriers (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 5). Sequencing was carried out using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and the deregulation of selected miRNAs was validated by real-time PCR. Pathway analyses of most deregulated miRNA were performed and their global profiling was combined with transcriptome data in ATLL. RESULTS: The sequencing identified specific sRNAs signatures associated with ATLL patients that target pathways relevant in ATLL, such as the transforming growth factor-(betaTGF-beta), Wnt, p53, apoptosis, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Network analysis revealed several miRNAs regulating highly connected genes within the ATLL transcriptome. miR-451-3p was the most downregulated miRNA in active patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the expression of specific sRNAs in HTLV-1 associated ATLL, which may represent promising candidates as biomarkers that help monitor the disease activity.","['Nascimento, Andrezza', 'Valadao de Souza, Daniela Raguer', 'Pessoa, Rodrigo', 'Pietrobon, Anna Julia', 'Nukui, Youko', 'Pereira, Juliana', 'Casseb, Jorge', 'Penalva de Oliveira, Augusto Cesar', 'Loureiro, Paula', 'da Silva Duarte, Alberto Jose', 'Clissa, Patricia Bianca', 'Sanabani, Sabri Saeed']","['Nascimento A', 'Valadao de Souza DR', 'Pessoa R', 'Pietrobon AJ', 'Nukui Y', 'Pereira J', 'Casseb J', 'Penalva de Oliveira AC', 'Loureiro P', 'da Silva Duarte AJ', 'Clissa PB', 'Sanabani SS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8876-8262'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210109,England,Infect Agent Cancer,Infectious agents and cancer,101276559,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asymptomatic carriers', 'HTLV-1', 'Massively parallel sequencing', 'Small RNA', 'T cell antigen receptor']",2021/01/11 06:00,2021/01/11 06:01,['2021/01/10 20:24'],"['2020/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 20:24 [entrez]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13027-020-00343-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13027-020-00343-2 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Agent Cancer. 2021 Jan 9;16(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s13027-020-00343-2.,,,"['Laboratory of Dermatology and Immunodeficiency, Department of Dermatology, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticles can be improved by enhancing the cancer cellular internalization. METHODS: In this study, we developed a humanized bispecific antibody (BsAbs: CD20 Ab-mPEG scFv) which retains the clinical anti-CD20 whole antibody (Ofatumumab) and is fused with an anti-mPEG single chain antibody (scFv) that can target the systemic liquid tumor cells. This combination achieves the therapeutic function and simultaneously ""grabs"" Lipo-Dox(R) (PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin, PLD) to enhance the cellular internalization and anticancer activity of PLD. RESULTS: We successfully constructed the CD20 Ab-mPEG scFv and proved that CD20 Ab-mPEG scFv can target CD20-expressing Raji cells and simultaneously grab PEGylated liposomal DiD increasing the internalization ability up to 60% in 24 h. We further showed that the combination of CD20 Ab-mPEG scFv and PLD successfully led to a ninefold increase in tumor cytotoxicity (LC50: 0.38 nM) compared to the CD20 Ab-DNS scFv and PLD (lC50: 3.45 nM) in vitro. Importantly, a combination of CD20 Ab-mPEG scFv and PLD had greater anti-liquid tumor efficacy (P = 0.0005) in Raji-bearing mice than CD20 Ab-DNS scFv and PLD. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that this ""double-attack"" strategy using CD20 Ab-mPEG scFv and PLD can retain the tumor targeting (first attack) and confer PLD tumor-selectivity (second attack) to enhance PLD internalization and improve therapeutic efficacy in liquid tumors.","['Ho, Kai-Wen', 'Chen, I-J U', 'Cheng, Yi-An', 'Liao, Tzu-Yi', 'Liu, En-Shuo', 'Chen, Huei-Jen', 'Lu, Yun-Chi', 'Su,

The pathogenesis of DS is complex and not well understood; however, it is considered as an inflammatory response due to cytokines release of differentiated cells. Moreover, adhesion molecules that are widely expressed on the surface of differentiated cells and gene expression changes of transglutaminase2 (TGM2) are mechanisms involved in the development of DS. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and TGM2 as inflammatory factors with differentiation syndrome susceptibility. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 133 APL patients and 100 normal controls. Assessment according to the PETHEMA criteria revealed that 13.5% of these patients experienced differentiation syndrome. Tetra-ARMS PCR and PCR-RFLP were done to amplify DNA fragments in APL patients with and without DS. Then DNA sequencing was done to validate the results. SNPStats, SPSS and Finch TV were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between rs4811528 in the TGM2 gene and differentiation syndrome susceptibility (P = 0.002, 95% CI = 1.74-18.81, OR = 5.72) while rs5498 in ICAM-1, rs1024611 in CCL2, and rs7270785 in TGM2 genes showed no correlation with differentiation syndrome. The G allele of rs7270785 and rs4811528 showed a haplotypic association with differentiation syndrome (P = 0.03, 95% CI = 1.13-13.86, OR = 3.96). CONCLUSIONS: AA genotype of the TGM2 SNP (rs4811528) may be a risk factor for development of DS in patients with APL following the use of ATRA/ATO.","['Mohammadzadeh, Zahra', 'Omidkhoda, Azadeh', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Hoseinzadeh, Ghazaleh', 'Moghaddam, Kamran Ali', 'Mousavi, Seyed Asadollah', 'Rostami, Shahrbano']","['Mohammadzadeh Z', 'Omidkhoda A', 'Chahardouli B', 'Hoseinzadeh G', 'Moghaddam KA', 'Mousavi SA', 'Rostami S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210109,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Promyelocytic leukemia', 'CCL2 chemokine', 'Differentiation syndrome', 'ICAM-1', 'SNPs', 'Transglutaminase II']",2021/01/11 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2021/01/10 20:23'],"['2020/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 20:23 [entrez]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-021-07783-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-021-07783-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2021 Jan 9;21(1):46. doi: 10.1186/s12885-021-07783-y.,20210510,,"['Hematology and Blood Banking Department, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology and Blood Banking Department, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. a-omidkhoda@tums.ac.ir.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology and Blood Banking Department, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. rostamyshahrbano8@gmail.com.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (ICAM1 protein, human)', '0 (TGM2 protein, human)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']","['Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemokine CCL2/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics', 'Transglutaminases/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects']",,,,PMC7797108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall remission rate (complete remission [CR] or CR without platelet recovery [CRp]) was 45.0% (27/60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 32.4 to 57.6) and the overall response rate (CR, CRp, or partial remission [PR]) was 46.7% (28/60; 95% CI, 34.0 to 59.3), with 11 (18.3%), 16 (26.7%), and one (1.7%) patients achieving CR, CRp, and PR, respectively. The median time to remission was 5.1 weeks (95% CI, 4.7 to 6.1). Median duration of remission was 16.6 weeks (range, 2.0 to 167.6 weeks). Sixteen patients (26.7%) proceeded to HSCT. There were 24 deaths; 14 due to treatment-emergent adverse events. CONCLUSION: Remission with clofarabine was observed in approximately half of the study patients who had overall expected safety profile; however, there was no favorable long-term survival outcome in this study.","['Choi, Jung Yoon', 'Hong, Che Ry', 'Hong, Kyung Taek', 'Kang, Hyoung Jin', 'Kim, Seongkoo', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Jang, Pil Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hyery', 'Koh, Kyung-Nam', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Seo, Jong Jin', 'Hahn, Seung Min', 'Han, Jung Woo', 'Lyu, Chuhl Joo', 'Yang, Eu Jeen', 'Lim, Young Tak', 'Yoo, Keon Hee', 'Koo, Hong Hoe', 'Kook, Hoon', 'Jeon, In Sang', 'Cho, Hana', 'Shin, Hee Young']","['Choi JY', 'Hong CR', 'Hong KT', 'Kang HJ', 'Kim S', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kim H', 'Koh KN', 'Im HJ', 'Seo JJ', 'Hahn SM', 'Han JW', 'Lyu CJ', 'Yang EJ', 'Lim YT', 'Yoo KH', 'Koo HH', 'Kook H', 'Jeon IS', 'Cho H', 'Shin HY']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210104,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Clofarabine', 'Leukemia', 'Pediatric cancer', 'Pediatric malignancy']",2021/01/11 06:00,2021/01/11 06:00,['2021/01/10 18:20'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/10 18:20 [entrez]']","['crt.2020.289 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2020.289 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Oct;53(4):1184-1194. doi: 10.4143/crt.2020.289.

The nuclear receptors Nur77 and NOR-1 are commonly downregulated in human AML blasts and have emerged as key therapeutic targets for AML. METHODS: This study aimed to identify Z-ligustilide (Z-LIG), the main phthalide of Rhizoma Chuanxiong, as a potential agent that can selectively target AML. The anti-AML activity of Z-LIG was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, and the effect and underlying mechanisms of Z-LIG on the restoration of Nur77 and NOR-1 was determined. Moreover, the role of Nur77 and NOR-1 in the regulation of Z-LIG-induced apoptosis and differentiation of AML cells was explored. RESULTS: Z-LIG preferentially inhibited the viability of human AML cells, as well as suppressed the proliferation and colony formation ability. Notably, a concentration-dependent dual effect of Z-LIG was observed in AML cells: inducing apoptosis at relatively high concentrations (25 muM to 100 muM) and promoting differentiation at relatively low concentrations (10 muM and 25 muM). Importantly, Z-LIG restored Nur77 and NOR-1 expression in AML cells by increasing Ace-H3 (lys9/14) enrichment in their promoters. Meanwhile, Z-LIG enhanced the recruitment of p300 and reduced the recruitment of HDAC1, HDAC4/5/7, and MTA1 in the Nur77 promoter and enhanced the recruitment of p-CREB and reduced HDAC1 and HDAC3 in the NOR-1 promoter. Furthermore, Z-LIG-induced apoptosis was shown to be correlated with the mitochondria localization of Nur77/NOR-1 and subsequent Bcl-2 conformational change, converting Bcl-2 from a cyto-protective phenotype into a cyto-destructive phenotype. Z-LIG-promoted differentiation was found to be related to Nur77/NOR-1-mediated myeloid differentiation-associated transcription factors Jun B, c-Jun, and C/EBPbeta. Finally, silencing of Nur77 and NOR-1 attenuated anti-AML activity of Z-LIG in NOD/SCID mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Z-LIG may serve as a novel bifunctional agent for AML by restoring Nur77/NOR-1-mediated apoptosis and differentiation.","['Wang, Chengqiang', 'Liu, Gen', 'Dou, Guojun', 'Yang, Yi', 'Chen, Lu', 'Ma, Hui', 'Jiang, Zhuyun', 'Ma, Haoyue', 'Li, Chenglong', 'Li, Li', 'Jiang, Mingdong', 'Lu, Qianwei', 'Li, Pan', 'Qi, Hongyi']","['Wang C', 'Liu G', 'Dou G', 'Yang Y', 'Chen L', 'Ma H', 'Jiang Z', 'Ma H', 'Li C', 'Li L', 'Jiang M', 'Lu Q', 'Li P', 'Qi H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201225,Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Differentiation', 'NOR-1', 'Nur77', 'Z-ligustilide']",2021/01/10 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2021/01/09 20:15'],"['2020/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 20:15 [entrez]']","['S0944-7113(20)30279-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153448 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2021 Feb;82:153448. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153448.

However, studies on CLL-like monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) are scarce. In the study described here, we characterized the immune environment in 62 individuals with clinical MBL, 56 patients with early-stage CLL, and 31 healthy controls. Gene expression arrays and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed on RNA from CD4(+) peripheral blood cells; serum cytokines were measured with immunoassays; and HLA-DR expression on circulating monocytes, as well as the percentages of Th1, cytotoxic, exhausted, and effector CD4(+) T cells, were evaluated by flow cytometry. In addition, cell cultures of clonal B cells and CD14-enriched or -depleted cell fractions were performed. Strikingly, MBL and early-stage CLL differed in pro-inflammatory signatures. An increased inflammatory drive orchestrated mainly by monocytes was identified in MBL, which exhibited enhanced phagocytosis, pattern recognition receptors, interleukin-8 (IL8), HMGB1, and acute response signaling pathways and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (in particular IL8, interferon gamma [IFNgamma], and tumor necrosis factor alpha). This inflammatory signature was diminished in early-stage CLL (reduced IL8 and IFNgamma levels, IL8 signaling pathway, and monocytic HLA-DR expression compared with MBL), especially in those patients with mutations in IGHV genes. Additionally, CD4(+) T cells of MBL and early-stage CLL exhibited a similar upregulation of Th1 and cytotoxic genes and expanded CXCR3(+) and perforin(+) CD4(+) T cells, as well as PD1(+) CD4(+) T cells, compared with controls. Cell culture assays disclosed tumor-supporting effects of monocytes similarly observed in MBL and early-stage CLL. These novel findings reveal differences in the inflammatory environment between MBL and CLL, highlighting an active role for antigen stimulation in the very early stages of the disease, potentially related to malignant B-cell transformation.","['Blanco, Gonzalo', 'Puiggros, Anna', 'Sherry, Barbara', 'Nonell, Lara', 'Calvo, Xavier', 'Puigdecanet, Eulalia', 'Chiu, Pui Yan', 'Kieso, Yasmine', 'Ferrer, Gerardo', 'Palacios, Florencia', 'Arnal, Magdalena', 'Rodriguez-Rivera, Maria', 'Gimeno, Eva', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Calon, Alexandre', 'Ferrer, Ana', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Espinet, Blanca']","['Blanco G', 'Puiggros A', 'Sherry B', 'Nonell L', 'Calvo X', 'Puigdecanet E', 'Chiu PY', 'Kieso Y', 'Ferrer G', 'Palacios F', 'Arnal M', 'Rodriguez-Rivera M', 'Gimeno E', 'Abella E', 'Rai KR', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Bosch F', 'Calon A', 'Ferrer A', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Espinet B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,,2021/01/10 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/01/09 20:07'],"['2020/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 20:07 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(21)00001-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2020.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2021 Mar;95:68-80. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2020.12.007.

To explore the hypothesis that inherited variation predisposes to mastocytosis, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study, analyzing 1,035 individuals with KIT D816V positive disease and 17,960 healthy control individuals from five European populations. After quality control, we tested 592,007 SNPs at stage 1 and 75 SNPs at stage 2 for association by using logistic regression and performed a fixed effects meta-analysis to combine evidence across the two stages. From the meta-analysis, we identified three intergenic SNPs associated with mastocytosis that achieved genome-wide significance without heterogeneity between cohorts: rs4616402 (pmeta = 1.37 x 10(-15), OR = 1.52), rs4662380 (pmeta = 2.11 x 10(-12), OR = 1.46), and rs13077541 (pmeta = 2.10 x 10(-9), OR = 1.33). Expression quantitative trait analyses demonstrated that rs4616402 is associated with the expression of CEBPA (peQTL = 2.3 x 10(-14)), a gene encoding a transcription factor known to play a critical role in myelopoiesis. The role of the other two SNPs is less clear: rs4662380 is associated with expression of the long non-coding RNA gene TEX41 (peQTL = 2.55 x 10(-11)), whereas rs13077541 is associated with the expression of TBL1XR1, which encodes transducin (beta)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (peQTL = 5.70 x 10(-8)). In individuals with available data and non-advanced disease, rs4616402 was associated with age at presentation (p = 0.009; beta = 4.41; n = 422). Additional focused analysis identified suggestive associations between mastocytosis and genetic variation at TERT, TPSAB1/TPSB2, and IL13.

This results in the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts within the bone marrow and peripheral blood. The incidence of AML increases with age, and in childhood, AML accounts for 20% of all leukaemias. Whilst there are many clinical and biological similarities between paediatric and adult AML with continuum across the age range, many characteristics of AML are associated with age of disease onset. These include chromosomal aberrations, gene mutations and differentiation lineage. Following chemotherapy, AML cells that survive and result in disease relapse exist in an altered chemoresistant state. Molecular profiling currently represents a powerful avenue of experimentation to study AML cells from adults and children pre- and postchemotherapy as a means of identifying prognostic biomarkers and targetable molecular vulnerabilities that may be age-specific. This review highlights recent advances in our knowledge of the molecular profiles with a focus on transcriptomes and metabolomes, leukaemia stem cells and chemoresistant cells in adult and paediatric AML and focus on areas that hold promise for future therapies.","['Aung, Myint Myat Khine', 'Mills, Megan L', 'Bittencourt-Silvestre, Joana', 'Keeshan, Karen']","['Aung MMK', 'Mills ML', 'Bittencourt-Silvestre J', 'Keeshan K']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7266-0890'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210211,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*adult', '*chemoresistance', '*clonality', '*omic profiling', '*paediatric']",2021/01/10 06:00,2021/01/10 06:00,['2021/01/09 17:11'],"['2020/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12899 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2021 Sep;15(9):2253-2272. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12899.

Tracking the dissemination of VRE strains is crucial to understand the dynamics of emergence and spread of VRE in the hospital setting. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify dominant VRE strains and potential transmission networks between 35 patients with VRE-positive rectal swabs and their rooms (main rooms and bathrooms) on the leukemia (LKM) and the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) floors. Sequence types (STs), drug resistance genes, and patients' outcomes were also determined. RESULTS: A total of 89 VRE strains grouped into 10 different STs, of which newly described STs were isolated from both floors (ST736, ST494, ST772, and ST1516). We observed highly genetically related strains transmitted between rooms, floors, and time periods in an average period of 39 days (ranging from 3 to 90 days). Of 5 VRE bacteremia events, 3 strains were lacking the pili operon fms14-17-13 (ST203) and the remaining 2 were resistant to daptomycin (DAP; ST736, ST664). Of 10 patients harboring DAP-resistant strains, only 2 were exposed to DAP within 4 months before strain recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparisons of VRE strains derived from the environment and immunocompromised patients confirmed horizontal transfer of highly related genetic lineages of multidrug-resistant (particularly to DAP) VRE strains between HCT and LKM patients and their room environment. Implementing WGS can be useful in distinguishing VRE reservoirs where interventions can be targeted to prevent and control the spread of highly resistant organisms.","['El Haddad, Lynn', 'Hanson, Blake M', 'Arias, Cesar A', 'Ghantoji, Shashank S', 'Harb, Cynthia P', 'Stibich, Mark', 'Chemaly, Roy F']","['El Haddad L', 'Hanson BM', 'Arias CA', 'Ghantoji SS', 'Harb CP', 'Stibich M', 'Chemaly RF']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['daptomycin (DAP)', 'immunocompromised', 'transmission', 'vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)', 'whole genome sequencing']",2021/01/10 06:00,2021/01/10 06:00,['2021/01/09 17:08'],"['2020/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 17:08 [entrez]']","['6075650 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciab001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2021 Dec 16;73(12):2306-2313. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciab001.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

In this study, we highlighted the role of Dmrt1 in balancing the innate immune response in goat mGSCs. Dmrt1 recruited promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf), also known as zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16 (Zbtb16), to repress the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent inflammatory signaling pathway and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Knockdown of Dmrt1 in seminiferous tubules resulted in widespread degeneration of germ and somatic cells, while the expression of proinflammatory factors were significantly enhanced. We also demonstrated that Dmrt1 stimulated proliferation of mGSCs, but repressed apoptosis caused by the immune response. Thus, Dmrt1 is sufficient to reduce inflammation in the testes, thereby establishing the stability of spermatogenesis and the testicular microenvironment.","['Wei, Yu-Dong', 'Du, Xiao-Min', 'Yang, Dong-Hui', 'Ma, Fang-Lin', 'Yu, Xiu-Wei', 'Zhang, Meng-Fei', 'Li, Na', 'Peng, Sha', 'Liao, Ming-Zhi', 'Li, Guang-Peng', 'Bai, Chun-Ling', 'Liu, Wei-Shuai', 'Hua, Jin-Lian']","['Wei YD', 'Du XM', 'Yang DH', 'Ma FL', 'Yu XW', 'Zhang MF', 'Li N', 'Peng S', 'Liao MZ', 'Li GP', 'Bai CL', 'Liu WS', 'Hua JL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zool Res,Zoological research,101697192,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Dmrt1', '*Goat', '*Male germline stem cells (mGSCs)', '*Plzf, Immune response']",2021/01/10 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:51'],"['2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 05:51 [entrez]']",['10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.186 [doi]'],ppublish,Zool Res. 2021 Jan 18;42(1):14-27. doi: 10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.186.,20210310,,"['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A & F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Northwest A & F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, School of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia 010021, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, School of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia 010021, China.

METHODS: Children and their parents completed the standardised questionnaires Pediatric Quality of life Inventory, Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and Impact of Event Scale. Parents also completed standardised questionnaires regarding their own mental health and quality of life. The results were compared to those of healthy children, kidney transplanted children and children in remission from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: Children with primary antibody deficiency reported a poorer health-related quality of life compared to healthy children and children in remission from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. They reported poorer mental health compared with healthy children. Mothers of children with primary antibody deficiency reported poorer mental health compared to mothers of healthy children but comparable to mothers of chronically ill children. Parents reported a similar quality of life as the general Norwegian population.

METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation and 48 serum cytokines were detected in CHB patients (DNA methylation: 15 cases; serum cytokines: 62 cases) with different CM syndromes, including dampness and heat of Gan (Liver) and gallbladder (CHB1, DNA methylation: 5 cases, serum cytokines: 15 cases), Gan stagnation and Pi (Spleen) deficiency (CHB2, DNA methylation: 5 cases, serum cytokines: 15 cases), Gan and Shen (Kidney) yin deficiency (CHB3, DNA methylation: 5 cases, serum cytokines: 16 cases), CHB with hidden symptoms (HS, serum cytokines:16 cases) and healthy controls (DNA methylation: 6 cases). DNA methylation of a critical gene was further validated and its mRNA expression was detected on enlarged samples. Genome-wide DNA methylation was detected using Human Methylation 450K Assay and furthered verified using pyrosequencing. Cytokines and mRNA expression of gene were evaluated using multiplex biometric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based immunoassay and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), respectively. RESULTS: Totally 28,667 loci, covering 18,403 genes were differently methylated among CHB1, CHB2 and CHB3 (P<0.05 and |Deltabeta value| > 0.17). Further validation showed that compared with HS, the hg19 CHR6: 29691140 and its closely surrounded 2 CpG loci were demethylated and its mRNA expressions were significantly up-regulated in CHB1 (P<0.05). However, they remained unaltered in CHB2 (P>0.05). Levels of Interleukin (IL)-12 were higher in CHB3 and HS than that in CHB1 and CHB2 groups (P<0.05). Levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta were higher in CHB3 than other groups and leukemia inhibitory factor level was higher in CHB1 and HS than CHB2 and CHB3 groups (P<0.05). IL-12, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta concentrations were positively correlated with human leukocyte antigen F (HLA-F) mRNA expression (R(2)=0.238, P<0.05; R(2)=0.224, P<0.05; R=0.447, P<0.01; respectively). Furthermore, combination of HLA-F mRNA and differential cytokines greatly improved the differentiating accuracy among CHB1, CHB2 and HS. CONCLUSIONS: Demethylation of CpG loci in 5' UTR of HLA-F may up-regulate its mRNA expression and HLA-F expression was associated with IL-12, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta levels, indicating that HLA-F and the differential cytokines might jointly involve in the classification of CM syndromes in CHB.

Mouse bone marrow macrophages and CMs were cultured in vitro under hypoxia for 12 h and reoxygenation for 6 h to establish an HR cell model. qPCR was used to detect the M1 or M2 macrophage markers IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MR, and Arg, and a macrophage and CM coculture system was then established. Macrophages were transfected with an exosome-CD63-red fluorescent protein (RFP) lentivirus, allowing secretion of exosomes expressing RFP, and GW4869 was used to inhibit exosome release by macrophages. qPCR detected miR-29 expression in macrophage-derived exosomes, and macrophages were transfected with miR-29a inhibitors to obtain exosomes with low miR-29a expression (siR-exos). Pyroptosis indicators were detected by Western blot and ELISA. Importantly, LPS induced bone marrow macrophage polarization to the M1 type as a positive control to further verify that these exosomes (LPS-exos) regulated CM pyroptosis by delivering miR29a. Dual luciferase reporter and Western blot assays were adopted to analyze the miR-29a and MCL-1 target relationship. In addition, MCL-1 overexpression was used as a rescue experiment to determine whether miR-29a regulates pyroptosis in CM by targeting MCL-1. Macrophages expressed the M1 macrophage markers IL-1beta and TNF-alpha after HR exposure. After CM coculture, RFP expression was significantly higher in the HR group than in the normal (Nor) group but significantly reduced in the GW4869 group. Immunofluorescence showed that caspase-1 mRNA and protein expression in the HR group was significantly higher than that in the Nor group (P < 0.05). Caspase-1 expression was significantly decreased in the GW4869 group compared with the HR group (P < 0.05). Western blotting showed that the pyrolysis-related NLRP3 and ASC protein expression levels were significantly upregulated in the HR group compared with the control (Ctr) and Nor groups (P < 0.05). However, GW4869 effectively inhibited pyroptosis-related protein expression (P < 0.05). In addition, ELISA showed that the expression of the inflammation indicators IL-1beta and IL-18 was significantly increased in the HR group compared to the Ctr group (P < 0.05) but decreased in the GW4869 group (P < 0.05). qPCR showed that miR-29a was upregulated in the HR group compared to the Nor group. Moreover, HR-induced exosomes (HR-exos) from macrophages exacerbated HR-induced CM pyroptosis, while inhibition of miR-29a in exosomes partially offset CM pyroptosis induction. LPS-exos promoted pyroptosis-related protein expression, as the IL-1beta and IL-18 concentrations were increased in the LPS-exos group. However, pyroptosis-related proteins were observably decreased, and IL-1beta and IL-18 were also significantly decreased after miR-29a inhibition when compared with that in the HR-exos and LPS-exos groups. Mcl-1 overexpression reversed miR-29a-mediated CM pyroptosis in an HR environment. HR treatment induced macrophage polarization towards the M1 phenotype, which mediated CM pyroptosis through exosomal miR-29a transfer by targeting MCL-1.","['Wang, Yan', 'Qiu, Zhimei', 'Yuan, Jinson', 'Li, Chaofu', 'Zhao, Ranzun', 'Liu, Weiwei', 'Deng, Wenwen', 'Gu, Ning', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Hu, Shan', 'Bai, Zhixun', 'Shi, Bei']","['Wang Y', 'Qiu Z', 'Yuan J', 'Li C', 'Zhao R', 'Liu W', 'Deng W', 'Gu N', 'Zhang W', 'Hu S', 'Bai Z', 'Shi B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5316-2351'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

How a specific subset of ExM becomes committed to a haematopoietic fate remains unclear. Here we demonstrate using an embryonic stem cell model that transient expression of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) governs haemogenic competency of ExM. Eomes regulates the accessibility of enhancers that the transcription factor stem cell leukaemia (SCL) normally utilizes to specify primitive erythrocytes and is essential for the normal development of Runx1(+) haemogenic endothelium. Single-cell RNA sequencing suggests that Eomes loss of function profoundly blocks the formation of blood progenitors but not specification of Flk-1(+) haematoendothelial progenitors. Our findings place Eomes at the top of the transcriptional hierarchy regulating early blood formation and suggest that haemogenic competence is endowed earlier during embryonic development than was previously appreciated.,"['Harland, Luke T G', 'Simon, Claire S', 'Senft, Anna D', 'Costello, Ita', 'Greder, Lucas', 'Imaz-Rosshandler, Ivan', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Marioni, John C', 'Bikoff, Elizabeth K', 'Porcher, Catherine', 'de Bruijn, Marella F T R', 'Robertson, Elizabeth J']","['Harland LTG', 'Simon CS', 'Senft AD', 'Costello I', 'Greder L', 'Imaz-Rosshandler I', 'Gottgens B', 'Marioni JC', 'Bikoff EK', 'Porcher C', 'de Bruijn MFTR', 'Robertson EJ']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9614-1403', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9351-9132', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6770-3769', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6302-5705', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9092-0852', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9015-5203', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4934-4125', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6562-0225']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210108,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,IM,,,2021/01/10 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:49'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 05:49 [entrez]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41556-020-00611-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41556-020-00611-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2021 Jan;23(1):61-74. doi: 10.1038/s41556-020-00611-8.

We analyzed relapse-free survival (RFS) in 92 allo-HCT patients who received TKI for >3 months after allo-HCT, and aimed to develop a novel indicator, called as current TKI- & relapse-free (cTRFree) achievement. TKI after allo-HCT was started as planned in 39 patients, based on measurable residual disease (MRD) in 53 at a median of 152 days after allo-HCT. There was no difference in post-TKI RFS between the planned and MRD-based starting groups (P = 0.69). Second-generation TKIs were associated with superior RFS in Ph-positive acute leukemia (HR 2.71, P = 0.031). TKI was stopped before relapse in 48 patients.

Similarly, a mismatch of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand induces NK cell activation. Therefore, if CMV reactivation occurs in the presence of KIR-ligand mismatch, it might improve CBT outcomes. We assessed the difference in the effect of CMV reactivation in the presence of KIR-ligand mismatch on disease relapse in the graft-versus-host direction. A total of 2840 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myeloid leukemia were analyzed. Among those with a HLA-Bw4/A3/A11 (KIR3DL-ligand) mismatch, CMV reactivation up to 100 days following CBT had a favorable impact on relapse (18.9% vs. 32.9%, P = 0.0149). However, this effect was not observed in cases without the KIR3DL-ligand mismatch or in those with or without a HLA-C1/C2 (KIR2DL-ligand) mismatch. The multivariate analysis suggested that CMV reactivation had a favorable effect on relapse only in cases with a KIR3DL-ligand mismatch (hazard ratio 0.54, P = 0.032). Moreover, the interaction effect between CMV reactivation and KIR3DL-ligand mismatch on relapse was significant (P = 0.039). Thus, our study reveals the association between KIR-ligand mismatches and CMV reactivation, which will enhance CBT outcomes.","['Yokoyama, Hisayuki', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Kawahara, Yuta', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Noguchi, Yuma', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Katsuoka, Yuna', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Ohta, Takanori', 'Kimura, Takafumi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Nakasone, Hideki', 'Morishima, Satoko']","['Yokoyama H', 'Kanda J', 'Kawahara Y', 'Uchida N', 'Tanaka M', 'Takahashi S', 'Onizuka M', 'Noguchi Y', 'Ozawa Y', 'Katsuoka Y', 'Ota S', 'Ohta T', 'Kimura T', 'Kanda Y', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Nakasone H', 'Morishima S']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7658-0687', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6704-3633', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0192-7233', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5952-5926', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3631-244X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4866-9307', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4404-2870', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5812-9315', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-4271']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,,2021/01/10 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:47'],"['2020/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 05:47 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-01203-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-01203-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Jun;56(6):1352-1363. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-01203-8.

An updated experience of the Lymphoma Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,1391-1401,10.1038/s41409-020-01197-3 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment option in advanced-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS). This study presents an updated analysis of the initial experience of the Lymphoma Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) describing the outcomes after allo-HSCT for MF and SS, with special emphasis on the impact of the use of unrelated donors (URD). METHODS AND PATIENTS: Eligible for this study were patients with advanced-stage MF or SS who underwent a first allo-HSCT from matched HLA-identical related or URD between January/1997 and December/2011. Sixty patients have been previously reported. RESULTS: 113 patients were included [77 MF (68%)]; 61 (54%) were in complete or partial remission, 86 (76%) received reduced-intensity protocols and 44 (39%) an URD allo-HSCT. With a median follow up for surviving patients of 73 months, allo-HSCT resulted in an estimated overall survival (OS) of 38% at 5 years, and a progression-free survival (PFS) of 26% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that advanced-phase disease (complete remission/partial remission >3, primary refractory or relapse/progression in patients that had received 3 or more lines of systemic treatment prior to transplant or the number of treatment lines was not known), a short interval between diagnosis and transplant (<18 months) were independent adverse prognostic factors for PFS; advanced-phase disease and the use of URDs were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS. CONCLUSIONS: This extended series supports that allo-HSCT is able to effectively rescue over one third of the population of patients with advanced-stage MF/SS. High relapse rate is still the major cause of failure and needs to be improved with better strategies before and after transplant. The negative impact of URD is a matter of concern and needs to be further elucidated in future studies.","['Domingo-Domenech, E', 'Duarte, R F', 'Boumedil, A', 'Onida, F', 'Gabriel, I', 'Finel, H', 'Arcese, W', 'Browne, P', 'Beelen, D', 'Kobbe, G', 'Veelken, H', 'Arranz, R', 'Greinix, H', 'Lenhoff, S', 'Poire, X', 'Ribera, J M', 'Thompson, J', 'Zuckerman, T', 'Mufti, G J', 'Cortelezzi, A', 'Olavarria, E', 'Dreger, P', 'Sureda, A', 'Montoto, S']","['Domingo-Domenech E', 'Duarte RF', 'Boumedil A', 'Onida F', 'Gabriel I', 'Finel H', 'Arcese W', 'Browne P', 'Beelen D', 'Kobbe G', 'Veelken H', 'Arranz R', 'Greinix H', 'Lenhoff S', 'Poire X', 'Ribera JM', 'Thompson J', 'Zuckerman T', 'Mufti GJ', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Olavarria E', 'Dreger P', 'Sureda A', 'Montoto S']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8907-090X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5697-366X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1897-0227', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6204-977X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7429-8570']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,,2021/01/10 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:47'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 05:47 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-01197-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-01197-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Jun;56(6):1391-1401. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-01197-3.

Here, we investigated the antitumor properties and action mechanism of TAS4464 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TAS4464 induced apoptotic cell death in various AML cell lines. TAS4464 treatments resulted in the activation of both the caspase-9-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase-8-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway in AML cells; combined treatment with inhibitors of these caspases markedly diminished TAS4464-induced apoptosis. In each apoptotic pathway, TAS4464 induced the mRNA transcription of the intrinsic proapoptotic factor NOXA and decreased that of the extrinsic antiapoptotic factor c-FLIP. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that the signaling pathway of the CRL substrate c-Myc was enriched after TAS4464 treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that TAS4464-induced c-Myc bound to the PMAIP1 (encoding NOXA) and CFLAR (encoding c-FLIP) promoter regions, and siRNA-mediated c-Myc knockdown neutralized both TAS4464-mediated NOXA induction and c-FLIP downregulation. TAS4464 activated both caspase-8 and caspase-9 along with an increase in NOXA and a decrease in c-FLIP, resulting in complete tumor remission in a human AML xenograft model. These findings suggest that NAE inhibition leads to anti-AML activity via a novel c-Myc-dependent apoptosis induction mechanism.","['Ochiiwa, Hiroaki', 'Ailiken, Guzhanuer', 'Yokoyama, Masataka', 'Yamagata, Kazuyuki', 'Nagano, Hidekazu', 'Yoshimura, Chihoko', 'Muraoka, Hiromi', 'Ishida, Keiji', 'Haruma, Tomonori', 'Nakayama, Akitoshi', 'Hashimoto, Naoko', 'Murata, Kazutaka', 'Nishimura, Motoi', 'Kawashima, Yusuke', 'Ohara, Osamu', 'Ohkubo, Shuichi', 'Tanaka, Tomoaki']","['Ochiiwa H', 'Ailiken G', 'Yokoyama M', 'Yamagata K', 'Nagano H', 'Yoshimura C', 'Muraoka H', 'Ishida K', 'Haruma T', 'Nakayama A', 'Hashimoto N', 'Murata K', 'Nishimura M', 'Kawashima Y', 'Ohara O', 'Ohkubo S', 'Tanaka T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8243-0113', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9554-4534', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9761-1750']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210108,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,,2021/01/10 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:46'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 05:46 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-01586-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-01586-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 Feb;40(7):1217-1230. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01586-4.

However, its gene has not been reported. In this study, we used a transcriptomics-based workflow to identify a full-length transcript of a BLL functional ortholog (termed BGL) from Boletopsis grisea, a close North American relative of B. leucomelaena. The deduced amino acid sequence of BGL was an obvious member of fungal fruit body lectin family (Pfam PF07367), a highly conserved group of mushroom lectins with a preference for binding O-glycans harboring the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TF-antigen; Galbeta1,3GalNAc-alpha-) and having two ligand binding sites. Functional characterization of recombinant BGL using glycan microarray analysis and surface plasmon resonance confirmed its ability to bind both the TF-antigen and beta-GlcNAc-terminated N-glycans. Structure-guided mutagenesis of BGL's two ligand binding clefts showed that one site is responsible for binding TF-antigen structures associated with O-glycans, whereas the second site specifically recognizes N-glycans with terminal beta-GlcNAc. Additionally, the two sites show no evidence of allosteric communication. Finally, mutant BGL proteins having single functional bindings site were used to enrich GlcNAc-capped N-glycans or mucin type O-glycopeptides from complex samples in glycomics and glycoproteomics analytical workflows.","['Ganatra, Mehul B', 'Potapov, Vladimir', 'Vainauskas, Saulius', 'Francis, Anthony Z', 'McClung, Colleen M', 'Ruse, Cristian I', 'Ong, Jennifer L', 'Taron, Christopher H']","['Ganatra MB', 'Potapov V', 'Vainauskas S', 'Francis AZ', 'McClung CM', 'Ruse CI', 'Ong JL', 'Taron CH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210108,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,,2021/01/10 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:46'],"['2019/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 05:46 [entrez]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-80488-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-80488-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Jan 8;11(1):160. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-80488-7.,20210907,,"['New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA.', 'New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA.', 'New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA.', 'New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA.', 'New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA.', 'New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA.', 'New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA.', 'New England Biolabs, Inc, 240 County Road, Ipswich, MA, 01938, USA. taron@neb.com.']","['0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', 'Boletopsis grisea']","['Agaricales/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Basidiomycota/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Sequence Alignment']",,,['R24 GM098791/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7794217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a KMT2A-ARHGEF12 fusion occurring during treatment of a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with topoisomerase II inhibitors leading to a secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple genetic analyses were performed on bone marrow cells of a girl initially diagnosed with AML. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis with AML, the t(9;11)(p21;q23)/KMT2A-MLLT3 genetic abnormality was found. After chemotherapy resulting in AML clinical remission, a 2 Mb deletion in 11q23 was found generating a KMT2A-ARHGEF12 fusion gene. When the patient later developed B lineage ALL, a t(14;19)(q32;q13), loss of one chromosome 9, and KMT2A-ARHGEF12 were detected. CONCLUSION: The patient sequentially developed AML and ALL with three leukemia-specific genomic abnormalities in her bone marrow cells, two of which were KMT2A-rearrangements.","['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Andersen, Kristin', 'Eilert-Olsen, Martine', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Munthe-Kaas, Monica Cheng', 'Buechner, Jochen', 'Osnes, Liv T N', 'Micci, Francesca', 'Heim, Sverre']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Andersen K', 'Eilert-Olsen M', 'Zeller B', 'Munthe-Kaas MC', 'Buechner J', 'Osnes LTN', 'Micci F', 'Heim S']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210108,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ARHGEF12', 'KMT2A', 'KMT2A-ARHGEF12', 'KMT2A-MLLT3.', 'Pediatric leukemia', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'fusion gene']",2021/01/10 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:31'],"['2020/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 05:31 [entrez]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['18/1/67 [pii]', '10.21873/cgp.20242 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2021 Jan-Feb;18(1):67-81. doi: 10.21873/cgp.20242.

METHODS: A population-based retrospective study including all patients (n=4238) diagnosed with CML in Ontario, Canada between 1986 and 2017 and and age-matched and sex-matched individuals who received healthcare but who did not have CML (controls: n=42 380). The cohort was divided into those entering before 2001 vs from 2001 onwards (when TKIs were introduced). We developed competing risks models to compare time-to-event in CML cases versus controls. We adjusted for baseline comorbidities and present subdistribution HRs and 95% CIs. The relationship between TKI use and MACE was assessed by logistic regression. RESULTS: Before 2001 and from 2001 on, patients with CML had a higher crude incidence of MACE than patients without CML (19.8 vs 15.3 and 20.3 vs 12.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, patients with CML had a lower subdistribution hazard for MACE (0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.76) before 2001; but from 2001, the adjusted subdistribution HR for MACE (1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.43) was similar to age-matched and sex-matched patients. The incidence (9.3 vs 13.8 per 1000 person-years) and subdistribution hazard for cardiovascular death (0.43, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.52) were lower in patients with CML than controls before 2001. From 2001 on, the incidence (6.3 vs 5.4 per 1000 person-years) and subdistribution hazard for cardiovascular death (0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18) were similar to age-matched and sex-matched patients without CML with a higher risk of cerebrovascular events (8.6 vs 5.6 per 1000 person-years; 1.35, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.83) and peripheral arterial events (6.9 vs 3.0 per 1000 person-years; 1.66 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.39) in patients with CML than patients without CML. Compared with imatinib, there was no difference in the risk of MACE among those prescribed dasatinib (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.10) or nilotinib (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.97). CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary CML population, the risk of MACE and cardiovascular death is at least as high as among age-matched and sex-matched patients without CML and may be higher for cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial events. No difference in the risk of MACE between imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib was observed.","['Leong, Darryl', 'Aghel, Nazanin', 'Hillis, Christopher', 'Siegal, Deborah', 'Karampatos, Sarah', 'Rangarajan, Sumathy', 'Pond, Gregory', 'Seow, Hsien']","['Leong D', 'Aghel N', 'Hillis C', 'Siegal D', 'Karampatos S', 'Rangarajan S', 'Pond G', 'Seow H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1968-169X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210108,England,Heart,Heart (British Cardiac Society),9602087,IM,['NOTNLM'],['*epidemiology'],2021/01/10 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2021/01/09 05:31'],"['2020/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/09 05:31 [entrez]']","['heartjnl-2020-318251 [pii]', '10.1136/heartjnl-2020-318251 [doi]']",ppublish,Heart. 2021 Apr;107(8):667-673. doi: 10.1136/heartjnl-2020-318251.

FLAIR was successfully amended to include an emerging promising experimental therapy to expedite its assessment, greatly reducing the time to reach the primary outcome compared to running a separate trial and without compromising the validity of the research or the ability to recruit to the trial and report the outcomes. The methodological and practical issues are presented, describing how they were addressed to ensure the amendment was a success. METHODS: FLAIR was designed as a two-arm trial requiring 754 patients. In stage 2, two new arms were added: a new experimental arm and a second control arm to protect the trial in case of a change in practice. In stage 3, the original experimental arm was closed as its planned recruitment target was reached. In total, 1516 participants will be randomised to the trial. RESULTS: The changes to the protocol and randomisation to add and stop arms were made seamlessly without pausing recruitment. The statistical considerations to ensure the results for the original and new hypotheses are unbiased were approved following peer review by oversight committees, Cancer Research UK, ethical and regulatory committees and pharmaceutical partners. These included the use of concurrent comparators in case of any stage effect, appropriate control of the type I error rate and consideration of analysis methods across trial stages. The operational aspects of successfully implementing the amendments are described, including gaining approvals and additional funding, data management requirements and implementation at centres. CONCLUSIONS: FLAIR is an exemplar of how an emerging experimental therapy can be assessed within an existing trial structure without compromising the conduct, reporting or validity of the trial. This strategy offered considerable resource savings and allowed the new experimental therapy to be assessed within a confirmatory trial in the UK years earlier than would have otherwise been possible. Despite the clear efficiencies, treatment arms are rarely added to ongoing trials in practice. This paper demonstrates how this strategy is acceptable, feasible and beneficial to patients and the wider research community. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN01844152 .

The cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is a molecule of cell adhesion with multiple functions and has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene. CADM1 has multifunctions on the pathogenesis of malignancies, and other normal cells such as immune cells. However, little is known about the function of CADM1 on cutaneous cells and cutaneous malignancies. CADM1 plays an important role in connecting cells with each other, contacting cells to deliver their signal, and acting as a scaffolding molecule for other immune cells to develop their immune responses. A limited number of studies reveal the contribution of CADM1 on the development of cutaneous malignancies. Solid cutaneous malignancies, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, reduce their CADM1 expression to promote the invasion and metastasis of the tumor. On the contrary to these cutaneous solid tumors except for Merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous lymphomas, such as adult-T cell leukemia/lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, and Sezary syndrome, increase their CADM1 expression for the development of tumor environment. Based on the role of CADM1 in the etiology of tumor development, the theory of CADM1 contribution will desirably be applied to skin tumors according to other organ malignancies, however, the characteristics of skin as a multicomponent peripheral organ should be kept in mind to conclude their prognoses.","['Sawada, Yu', 'Mashima, Emi', 'Saito-Sasaki, Natsuko', 'Nakamura, Motonobu']","['Sawada Y', 'Mashima E', 'Saito-Sasaki N', 'Nakamura M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201220,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CADM1', 'Merkel cell carcinoma', 'lymphoma', 'melanoma', 'skin', 'squamous cell carcinoma']",2021/01/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2021/01/09 01:02'],"['2020/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249732 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249732 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 20;21(24). pii: ijms21249732. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249732.,20210409,,"['Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant']","['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",,,,PMC7766610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the activity of BCR-ABL1 protein have improved the prognosis; however, relapses are frequent because of acquired somatic mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain causing resistance to first, second and third generation TKIs. Axitinib has shown in vitro and ex vivo activity in blocking ABL1; however, clinical trials exploring its efficacy in ALL are missing.

Therefore, we reduced the dose of ATRA instead of stopping it altogether and administered dexamethasone to the patient. A hearing test performed thereafter revealed recovery of hearing. No recurrence of hearing loss occurred after prednisolone and ATRA were combined in the maintenance phase.

The goal of this review is to assess the degree to which both low-dosage and high-dosage corticosteroids contribute to serious adverse events (SAEs) following live varicella vaccination and live zoster vaccination. To this end, we examined multiple published reports of SAEs following varicella vaccination (Varivax(TM)) and zoster vaccination (Zostavax(TM)). We observed that five of eight viral SAEs following varicella vaccination, including two deaths, occurred in children receiving corticosteroids, while one of three fatal viral SAEs following live zoster vaccination occurred in an adult being treated with low-dosage prednisone. The latter death after live zoster vaccination occurred in a 70 year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis, being treated with prednisone 10 mg daily. Thus, corticosteroids contributed to more severe infectious complications in subjects immunized with each of the two live virus vaccines. Further, when we surveyed the rheumatology literature as well as individual case reports, we documented examples where daily dosages of 7.5-20 mg prednisone were associated with increased rates of severe wild-type varicella-zoster virus infections in children and adults.","['Price, Nathan B', 'Grose, Charles']","['Price NB', 'Grose C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6884-6668'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210106,Switzerland,Vaccines (Basel),Vaccines,101629355,,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV', 'RNA polymerase III', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'herpes zoster', 'natural killer cells', 'prednisone', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'severe combined immunodeficiency', 'varicella meningitis', 'varicella-zoster virus']",2021/01/10 06:00,2021/01/10 06:01,['2021/01/09 01:01'],"['2020/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/10 06:01 [medline]']","['vaccines9010023 [pii]', '10.3390/vaccines9010023 [doi]']",epublish,Vaccines (Basel). 2021 Jan 6;9(1). pii: vaccines9010023. doi: 10.3390/vaccines9010023.,,,"['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases/Virology Laboratory, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",,,,,['AI153817/NH/NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7825138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is catalysed by several DNA methyltransferases, including Dnmt3b that mediates both methylation-dependant and independent gene repression. Dnmt3b is critical for mouse embryogenesis and functions as a tumour suppressor in haematologic malignancies in mice. However, the extent to which Dnmt3b's catalytic activity (CA) is involved in development and cancer is unclear. METHODS: We used a mouse model expressing catalytically inactive Dnmt3b (Dnmt3b(CI)) to study a role of Dnmt3b's CA in development and cancer. We utilized global approaches including Whole-genome Bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq to analyse DNA methylation and gene expression to identify putative targets of Dnmt3b's CA. To analyse postnatal development and haematopoiesis, we used tissue staining, histological and FACS analysis. To determine potential involvement of selected genes in lymphomagenesis, we used overexpression and knock down approaches followed by in vitro growth assays. FINDINGS: We show that mice expressing Dnmt3b(CI) only, survive postnatal development and develop ICF (the immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies) -like syndrome. The lack of Dnmt3b's CA promoted fibroblasts transformation in vitro, accelerated MLL-AF9 driven Acute Myeloid Leukaemia and MYC-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis in vivo. The elimination of Dnmt3b's CA resulted in decreased methylation of c-Met promoter and its upregulation, activated oncogenic Met signalling, Stat3 phosphorylation and up-regulation of Lin28b promoting lymphomagenesis. INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrates that Dnmt3b's CA is largely dispensable for mouse development but critical to prevent tumourigenesis by controlling events involved in cellular transformation.

This aneuploid condition also results in an enhanced risk of a spectrum of comorbid conditions, such as leukemia, early onset Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Individuals with DS also display an increased incidence of wound healing complications and resistance to solid tumor development. Due to this unique phenotype and the involvement of eicosanoids in key comorbidities like poor healing and tumor development, we hypothesized that cells from DS individuals would display altered eicosanoid production. Using age- and sex-matched dermal fibroblasts we interrogated this hypothesis. Briefly, assessment of over 90 metabolites derived from cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome p450 systems revealed a possible deficiency in the COX system. Basal gene expression and Western blotting experiments showed significantly decreased gene expression of COX1 and 2, and COX2 protein abundance in DS fibroblasts compared to euploid controls. Further, using two different stressors, scratch wound or LPS, we found that DS fibroblasts could not upregulate COX2 abundance and prostaglandin E2 production. Together, these findings show that dermal fibroblasts from DS individuals have a deficient COX2 response, which may contribute to wound healing complications and tumor resistance in DS.","['Marentette, John O', 'Anderson, Colin C', 'Prutton, Kendra M', 'Jennings, Erin Q', 'Rauniyar, Abhishek K', 'Galligan, James J', 'Roede, James R']","['Marentette JO', 'Anderson CC', 'Prutton KM', 'Jennings EQ', 'Rauniyar AK', 'Galligan JJ', 'Roede JR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210105,United States,Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,9808648,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arachidonic acid', '*COX2', '*Down syndrome', '*PGE2', '*Prostaglandin']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/01/08 20:16'],"['2020/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 20:16 [entrez]']","['S1098-8823(20)30117-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2020.106524 [doi]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2021 Apr;153:106524. doi: 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2020.106524.

METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Progress, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched (database inception-present) to identify evidence of efficacy and safety of PRRT re-treatment in adults with NETs previously treated with (177)Lu- and/or (90)Y-PRRT. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) from time of re-treatment were assessed. Data were pooled using medians and variance for time-to-event outcomes and inverse-variance weighted proportions (Freeman-Tukey method) for binary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 567 studies screened, 13 reported re-treatment efficacy outcomes. In random-effects meta-analyses of (177)Lu-PRRT re-treatment, median PFS (N = 7 studies [414patients]) was 12.52 months (95% CI 9.82-15.22) with moderate heterogeneity across studies (I(2) = 50.5%), median OS (N = 2 [194 patients]) was 26.78 months (95% CI 18.73-34.83) with moderate-to-high heterogeneity (I(2) = 57.5%), and DCR (N = 8 [347 patients]) was 71% (95% CI 66-75) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 81.5%). PFS was similar with either (177)Lu-PRRT re-treatment alone or in combination with (90)Y-PRRT. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 5% (95% CI 2-8) of patients receiving (177)Lu-PRRT re-treatment (N = 5 [271 patients]) with few grade 3/4 renal toxicities (0% [95% CI 0-1]). Pooled myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia incidence was 0% (95%CI 0-2). CONCLUSION: Re-treatment with (177)Lu-PRRT provided encouraging median PFS in patients with NETs with a safety profile similar to initial PRRT.","['Strosberg, Jonathan', 'Leeuwenkamp, Oscar', 'Siddiqui, Mohd Kashif']","['Strosberg J', 'Leeuwenkamp O', 'Siddiqui MK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20201222,Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['(177)Lu-DOTATATE', 'Lutetium-177 DOTATATE', 'Neuroendocrine tumor', 'Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy', 'Progression-free survival']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/02/13 06:00,['2021/01/08 20:13'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 20:13 [entrez]']","['S0305-7372(20)30180-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102141 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2021 Feb;93:102141. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102141.

AFF4 (AF4/FMR2 family member 4), as a scaffold protein, is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC), and is involved in the progression of tumors, e.g., leukemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, few studies on AFF4 have focused on melanoma. Here, AFF4 expression levels and clinicopathological features were evaluated in melanoma tissue samples. Then, we performed cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays in A375 and A2058 cells lines in vitro to evaluate the role of AFF4 in melanoma. The effects of AFF4 knockdown in vivo were characterized via a xenograft mouse model. Finally, the correlation between c-Jun and AFF4 protein levels in melanoma was analyzed by rescue assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We found that AFF4 expression was upregulated in melanoma tumor tissues and that AFF4 protein expression was also closely related to the prognosis of patients with cutaneous melanoma.

AFF4 might regulate c-Jun activity to promote the invasion and migration of melanoma cells. Importantly, c-Jun was regulated by the AFF4 promoted melanoma tumorigenesis in vivo.

METHODS: Children and young adults with CD19-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were assigned to high- (>/= 40%) or low- (< 40%) tumor burden cohorts (HTBC or LTBC) based on a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy before infusion. HTBC patients received a single dose of tocilizumab (8-12 mg/kg) after development of high, persistent fevers. LTBC patients received standard CRS management. The primary end point was the frequency of grade 4 CRS (Penn scale), with an observed rate of </= 5 of 15 patients in the HTBC pre-defined as clinically meaningful. In post hoc analyses, the HTBC was compared with a historical cohort of high-tumor burden patients from the initial phase I CTL019 trial. RESULTS: The primary end point was met. Seventy patients were infused with CTL019, 15 in the HTBC and 55 in the LTBC. All HTBC patients received the PT intervention. The incidence of grade 4 CRS was 27% (95% CI, 8 to 55) in the HTBC and 3.6% (95% CI, 0.4 to 13) in the LTBC. The best overall response rate was 87% in the HTBC and 100% in the LTBC. Initial CTL019 expansion was greater in the HTBC than the LTBC (P < .001), but persistence was not different (P = .73). Event-free and overall survival were worse in the HTBC (P = .004, P < .001, respectively). In the post hoc analysis, grade 4 CRS was observed in 27% versus 50% of patients in the PT and prior phase I cohorts, respectively (P = .18). CONCLUSION: Risk-adapted PT administration resulted in a decrease in the expected incidence of grade 4 CRS, meeting the study end point, without adversely impacting the antitumor efficacy or safety of CTL019.","['Kadauke, Stephan', 'Myers, Regina M', 'Li, Yimei', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Baniewicz, Diane', 'Barrett, David M', 'Barz Leahy, Allison', 'Callahan, Colleen', 'Dolan, Joseph G', 'Fitzgerald, Julie C', 'Gladney, Whitney', 'Lacey, Simon F', 'Liu, Hongyan', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'McGuire, Regina', 'Motley, Laura S', 'Teachey, David T', 'Wertheim, Gerald B', 'Wray, Lisa', 'DiNofia, Amanda M', 'Grupp, Stephan A']","['Kadauke S', 'Myers RM', 'Li Y', 'Aplenc R', 'Baniewicz D', 'Barrett DM', 'Barz Leahy A', 'Callahan C', 'Dolan JG', 'Fitzgerald JC', 'Gladney W', 'Lacey SF', 'Liu H', 'Maude SL', 'McGuire R', 'Motley LS', 'Teachey DT', 'Wertheim GB', 'Wray L', 'DiNofia AM', 'Grupp SA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2996-8034', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2542-2061', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9067-6992', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7482-5644', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1368-4064', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4431-7515', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2210-8736', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7373-8987', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0012-9739', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8030-7595']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210108,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/01/08 17:08'],"['2022/03/10 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 17:08 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.02477 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Mar 10;39(8):920-930. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.02477.

There is no study to investigate the prognostic value of Wnt and Fzd gene families in AML. Our study screened 84 AML patients receiving chemotherapy only and 71 also undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We found that some Wnt and Fzd genes had significant positive correlations. The expression levels of Fzd gene family were independent of survival in AML patients. In the chemotherapy group, AML patients with high Wnt2B or Wnt11 expression had significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS); high Wnt10A expressers had significantly longer OS than the low expressers (all P < .05), whereas, in the allo-HSCT group, the expression levels of Wnt gene family were independent of survival. We further found that high expression of Wnt10A and Wnt11 had independent prognostic value, and the patients with high Wnt10A and low Wnt11 expression had the longest EFS and OS in the chemotherapy group. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that genes related to Wnt10A, Wnt11 and Wnt 2B were mainly enriched in 'cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation', 'haematopoietic cell lineage', 'platelet activation, signalling and aggregation' and 'mitochondrial RNA metabolic process' signalling pathways. Our results indicate that high Wnt2B and Wnt11 expression predict poor prognosis, and high Wnt10A expression predicts favourable prognosis in AML, but their prognostic effects could be neutralized by allo-HSCT. Combined Wnt10A and Wnt11 may be a novel prognostic marker in AML.","['Dai, Yifeng', 'Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Fricke, Doerte R', 'Zhao, Hongyou', 'Huang, Wenhui', 'Zhong, Qingfu', 'Zhu, Pei', 'Zhang, Wenjuan', 'Wu, Zhihua', 'Lin, Qing', 'Zhu, Huoyan', 'Liu, Yan', 'Qian, Tingting', 'Fu, Lin', 'Cui, Longzhen', 'Zeng, Tiansheng']","['Dai Y', 'Cheng Z', 'Fricke DR', 'Zhao H', 'Huang W', 'Zhong Q', 'Zhu P', 'Zhang W', 'Wu Z', 'Lin Q', 'Zhu H', 'Liu Y', 'Qian T', 'Fu L', 'Cui L', 'Zeng T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3507-7414', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8837-9542', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2416-7572']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210108,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Wnt-Fzd signalling pathway', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*allo-HSCT', '*chemotherapy', '*prognosis']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/09/23 06:00,['2021/01/08 12:17'],"['2020/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 12:17 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.16233 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2021 Feb;25(3):1456-1467. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.16233.

A previous study suggested that changes occurring within the first month post-trauma can lead to development of PVR later. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor clinically used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, on fibrotic changes occurring within the first month following ocular trauma. METHODS: A previously established swine ocular trauma model that mimics both contusion and penetrating injuries was used. Dasatinib was administered on days 4 and 18 post-trauma via intravitreal injection of either bolus solution or suspension of a sustained release system incorporated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. Animals were followed up to day 32, and the development of traction full-thickness fold in the posterior retina was assessed. RESULTS: A full-thickness retinal fold extending from the wound site developed in 3 out of 4 control eyes injected with PLGA nanoparticles alone at 1 month. Administration of dasatinib solution had little preventative effect with 6 out of 7 eyes developing a fold. In contrast, dasatinib-incorporated PLGA nanoparticle injection significantly reduced the incidence of fold to 1 out of 10 eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Injection of dasatinib-incorporated PLGA significantly reduced early fibrotic retinal changes which eventually lead to PVR following posterior ocular trauma. Thus, our sustained dasatinib release system can potentially be used to both prevent and/or broaden the surgical treatment window for PVR.","['Ueda, Shunichiro', 'Nunn, Betty M', 'Chauhan, Rajat', 'McDonald, Kevin', 'Kaplan, Henry J', ""O'Toole, Martin G"", 'Tamiya, Shigeo']","['Ueda S', 'Nunn BM', 'Chauhan R', 'McDonald K', 'Kaplan HJ', ""O'Toole MG"", 'Tamiya S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0234-2664'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,Germany,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,8205248,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Fibrosis', 'Ocular trauma', 'Sustained release system', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2021/01/08 12:15'],"['2020/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 12:15 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00417-020-05037-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00417-020-05037-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2021 May;259(5):1103-1111. doi: 10.1007/s00417-020-05037-4.

The increased amount of data on the efficacy and safety of B-cell-depleting therapies from several studies has suggested the addition of these drugs as treatment options to the current armamentarium of disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS. Particularly, rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 positive B lymphocytes resulting in cell-mediated apoptosis, has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory activity, incidence of relapses and new brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Additional evidence also demonstrated that patients with progressive MS (PMS) may benefit from RTX, which also showed to be well tolerated, with acceptable safety risks and favorable cost-effectiveness profile.Despite these encouraging results, RTX is currently approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, several forms of vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis, while it can only be administered off-label for MS treatment. Between Northern European countries exist different rules for using not licensed drug for treating MS. The Sweden MS register reports a high rate (53.5%) of off-label RTX prescriptions in relation to other annually started DMTs to treat MS patients, while Danish and Norwegian neurologists have to use other anti-CD20 drugs, as ocrelizumab, in most of the cases.In this paper, we review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety profile and cost effectiveness aspects of RTX for the treatment of MS.

There were only sparse cases describing the effect of CAR T cells on low-burden CNSL, and the safety and effectiveness of CAR T cells in high-burden CNSL remains unknown. METHODS: Here, we retrospectively analyzed the results of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in 12 pediatric patients that had low (Blasts < 20/muL in CSF) or high-burdens (Blasts or intracranial solid mass) of CNS B-ALL, that are enrolled in three clinical trials and one pilot study at Beijing Boren Hospital RESULTS: Eleven patients (91.7%) achieved complete remission (CR) on day 30, and one patient got CR on day 90 after infusion. Most patient experienced mild cytokine-release syndrome. However, of the five patients who retained > 5/muL blasts in CSF or a solid mass before CAR T-cell expansion, four developed severe (grade 3-4) neurotoxicity featured by persistent cerebral edema and seizure, and they fully recovered after intensive managements. Sustained remission was achieved in 9 of the 12 patients, resulted in a 6-month leukemia-free survival rate of 81.8% (95% CI 59.0-100). Only one patient has CNS relapse again. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that CAR T cells are effective in clearing both low- and high-burden CNSL, but a high CNSL burden before CAR T-cell expansion may cause severe neurotoxicity requiring intense intervention.","['Tan, Yue', 'Pan, Jing', 'Deng, Biping', 'Ling, Zhuojun', 'Song, Weiliang', 'Xu, Jinlong', 'Duan, Jiajia', 'Wang, Zelin', 'Yu, Xinjian', 'Chang, Alex H', 'Feng, Xiaoming']","['Tan Y', 'Pan J', 'Deng B', 'Ling Z', 'Song W', 'Xu J', 'Duan J', 'Wang Z', 'Yu X', 'Chang AH', 'Feng X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6272-6849'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210108,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'CD19 CAR T', 'CNSL', 'High-burden', 'Immunotherapy']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/01/08 12:13'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 12:13 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-020-02829-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-020-02829-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2021 Jul;70(7):1979-1993. doi: 10.1007/s00262-020-02829-9.

The previous reports focused mainly on matched sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation. There are no reports on haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) in MS. We retrospectively reviewed 14 MS patients who underwent haplo-HSCT. All patients achieved complete donor engraftment. The median time for neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment were 10 (12-21) days and 18 (8-31) days. The 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 3-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD were 37.7% (95%CI, 23.2-52.1%) and 35.7% (95%CI, 22.2-49.2%). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation was documented in 86% patients, and only one patient developed CMV pneumonia. Treatment-related mortality occurred in one (7%) patient. The 1- and 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 21.4% (95%CI, 11.8-31.1%) and 35.7% (95%CI, 22.4-49.0%). The probability of overall survival at 1 and 3 years was 71.4% (95%CI, 51.3-99.5%) and 64.3% (95%CI, 43.5-95.0%), respectively.

The cellular hierarchy in JMML is poorly characterized, including the identity of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). FACS and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal marked heterogeneity of JMML hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), including an aberrant Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA+ population. Single-cell HSPC index-sorting and clonogenic assays show that (1) all somatic mutations can be backtracked to the phenotypic HSC compartment, with RAS-pathway mutations as a ""first hit,"" (2) mutations are acquired with both linear and branching patterns of clonal evolution, and (3) mutant HSPCs are present after allogeneic HSC transplant before molecular/clinical evidence of relapse. Stem cell assays reveal interpatient heterogeneity of JMML LSCs, which are present in, but not confined to, the phenotypic HSC compartment. RNA sequencing of JMML LSC reveals up-regulation of stem cell and fetal genes (HLF, MEIS1, CNN3, VNN2, and HMGA2) and candidate therapeutic targets/biomarkers (MTOR, SLC2A1, and CD96), paving the way for LSC-directed disease monitoring and therapy in this disease.","['Louka, Eleni', 'Povinelli, Benjamin', 'Rodriguez-Meira, Alba', 'Buck, Gemma', 'Wen, Wei Xiong', 'Wang, Guanlin', 'Sousos,

During Bcell development, preBCR differentiation signaling components terminate proliferative expansion and promote Bcell maturation. To study whether preBCR differentiation signaling components regulate the initiation and development of BCRABL1+ BALL, the tumor suppression mechanism of differentiationrelated signaling molecules in BCRABL1transformed proB cells were analyzed. The results demonstrated that BcrAbl kinase activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, promoting cell growth, and upregulated Aid expression, increasing genomic instability in proB cells. These findings suggest that BcrAbl kinase mediates proB cell malignant transformation. Furthermore, the present data revealed that BCRABL1 oncogenic stress triggered enhanced expression of Bcell differentiation components Bcell linker (Blnk) and forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1) in BCRABL1 transformed proB cells. Using the CRISPR/Cas9mediated Blnk or Foxo1 knockout BCRABL1transformed proB cells, it was identified that, in BCRABL1transformed proB cells, Blnk and Foxo1 reduced BcrAbl kinase activity to induce cell cycle arrest and decrease genomic instability. In addition, Blnk suppressed the PI3K/Akt pathway to reduce Foxo1 phosphorylation and heighten the Foxo1 activity, indicating that, in BCRABL1transformed proB cells, Foxo1 participated in the regulation of BcrAbl kinase by Blnk. The present data highlighted the antitumor mechanisms of Blnk and Foxo1 in the regulation of BcrAbl kinase, and thus, may offer an alternative therapeutic strategy to BcrAbl kinase regulation in BCRABL1+ BALL.","['Zhang, Ping', 'Wang, Yang', 'Qin, Mengting', 'Li, Dandan', 'Odhiambo, Woodvine Otieno', 'Yuan, Meng', 'Lv, Zhuangwei', 'Liu, Chengcheng', 'Ma, Yunfeng', 'Dong, Yanying', 'Ji, Yanhong']","['Zhang P', 'Wang Y', 'Qin M', 'Li D', 'Odhiambo WO', 'Yuan M', 'Lv Z', 'Liu C', 'Ma Y', 'Dong Y', 'Ji Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201208,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCRABL1+ B-ALL', '*Bcr-Abl kinase activity', '*B-cell linker', '*forkhead box protein O1']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/01/08 08:37'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 08:37 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2020.7888 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2021 Feb;45(2):693-705. doi: 10.3892/or.2020.7888.

In the AML microenvironment, bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) serve an important role in protecting AML cells from chemotherapyinduced apoptosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the expression of fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPalpha) in BMMSCs and BM biopsy samples via flow cytometry, reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, as well as to identify the correlation between the expression of FAPalpha in BM with clinical parameters and survival of newly diagnosed patients with AML. Subsequently, the protective effect of FAPalpha on Cytosine arabinoside (AraC)induced apoptosis in Kasumi1 cells was investigated via small interfering (si)RNA, and its underlying mechanism was examined by western blotting. The results demonstrated significant differences in FAPalpha expression in BMMSCs and BM biopsy samples between patients with AML and healthy donors. Furthermore, BMMSCs protected AraCinduced Kasumi1 cells from apoptosis, and knockdown of FAPalpha using siRNA decreased this protection. It was found that Kasumi1 cells expressed betacatenin, which could be inhibited by AraC, and betacatenin expression was significantly activated when cocultured with BMMSCs, even in the presence of AraC. Knockdown of FAPalpha with siRNA significantly suppressed the expression of betacatenin. The present results indicated that FAPalpha serves an important role in the AML BM microenvironment, and that increased expression of FAPalpha in BM may be a poor prognostic factor in patients with AML. Moreover, the current findings demonstrated that BMMSCs protected AML cells from apoptosis, which was in part contributed by FAPalpha, and may occur via the betacatenin signaling pathway.","['Mei, Shuchong', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Yu, Li', 'Chen, Guoan', 'Zi, Fuming']","['Mei S', 'Zhang Y', 'Yu L', 'Chen G', 'Zi F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20201130,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*fibroblast activation protein alpha', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells', '*cancer-associated fibroblast', '*beta-catenin']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/01/08 08:37'],"['2020/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 08:37 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2020.7874 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2021 Feb;45(2):641-651. doi: 10.3892/or.2020.7874.

Transcription factor 7 (TCF7) is one of the main Wnt/betacatenin signaling mediators. Previous studies have shown that TCF7 is vital for tumor initiation, and targeting TCF7 can reduce drug resistance in many types of cancer. However, the role of TCF7 in CML imatinibresistant cells is unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the transcriptomic data from CML clinical samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and performed experimental verification in the CML imatinibresistant cell line K562/G01. We found that the expression of TCF7 was independent of BCRABL1 activity. Silencing of TCF7 downregulated the expression levels of CTNNB1, CCND1, and ABCC2, and therefore inhibited proliferation, weakened colony formation, and increased the drug sensitivity of imatinibresistant cells. After analyzing the transcriptomic data of four groups (Scramble, TCF7_KD, Scramble+imatinib, and TCF7_KD+imatinib) using bioinformatics, we noted that Wnt/betacatenin and ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter signaling pathways were upregulated in imatinibresistant cells under conventional dose of imatinib, and TCF7 knockdown could neutralize this effect. Next, using ChIPqPCR, we demonstrated that TCF7 was recruited to the promoter region of ABCC2 and activated gene transcription. In summary, our results highlight that the upregulation of Wnt/betacatenin and ABC transporter signaling pathways induced by imatinib treatment of resistant cells confers imatinib resistance, and reveal that targeting TCF7 to regulate the Wnt/betacatenin/TCF7/ABC transporter signaling axis may represent an effective strategy for overcoming imatinib resistance.","['Zhang, Hui', 'Wang, Yonghong', 'Yang, Hao', 'Huang, Zhenglan', 'Wang, Xin', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Zhang H', 'Wang Y', 'Yang H', 'Huang Z', 'Wang X', 'Feng W']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201127,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*imatinib resistance', '*TCF7', '*ATP-binding cassette transporters', '*Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/01/08 08:37'],"['2020/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 08:37 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2020.7869 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2021 Feb;45(2):557-568. doi: 10.3892/or.2020.7869.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective clinicopathologic review of 12 patients with CLL/SLL who developed a second lymphoma in the skin. Demographic data, clinical information, and histopathology from 31 biopsies were recorded. Cases of secondary cutaneous involvement by CLL/SLL (leukemia cutis) and non-primary cutaneous lymphomas were excluded. RESULTS: A wide variety of primary cutaneous lymphomas was identified, including classic mycosis fungoides (3), cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (2), primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (2), folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (1), Sezary syndrome (1), cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (1), cutaneous CD8+ aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma (1), and cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (1). A male predominance was observed, and the average age was 74.1 years. In all patients, CLL/SLL predated the development of the second lymphoma, which was aggressive in the majority of cases (58%). Aggressive cytotoxic T-cell lymphomas, generally rare neoplasms, were relatively common (30%). CONCLUSIONS: CLL/SLL patients may develop a second lymphoma in the skin, which may be aggressive. Atypical cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates in this patient population should not be assumed to represent secondary CLL/SLL involvement and require thorough immunohistochemical analysis.","['Liu, Yi Ariel', 'Finn, Alexander J', 'Subtil, Antonio']","['Liu YA', 'Finn AJ', 'Subtil A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5382-8774', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6401-1900']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210123,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic', 'cutis', 'leukemia', 'lymphocytic', 'lymphoma', 'skin', 'small']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:19'],"['2020/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:19 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cup.13956 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2021 May;48(5):617-624. doi: 10.1111/cup.13956.

We aimed to report a case of AMN and underlying disease of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CASE PRESENTATION: A thirty-five-year-old female patient with bone marrow biopsy confirmed AML, and bicytopenia, under chemotherapy, complained of sudden paracentral visual field defect in her right eye was referred. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Posterior segment evaluation revealed multiple Roth's spots. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated hyper-reflectivity band, in the outer nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer, nasal to the fovea of the right eye, and hyperreflective patch in outer retina segmentation en-face OCT, suggestive of the diagnosis of AMN. Nine days after AMN diagnosis, dyspnea, malaise, and cough was initiated. Ground glass opacities in lung CT scan, beside reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, was conclusive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient deceased after 6 days. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of AMN following AML. Our findings support the role of ischemia in the outer retina, of which AML may contributed to the pathophysiological process. The patient has deceased less than 2 weeks from AMN initiation.","['Zamani, Ghodsieh', 'Ataei Azimi, Sajjad', 'Aminizadeh, Ali', 'Shams Abadi, Elham', 'Kamandi, Mostafa', 'Mortazi, Hasan', 'Shariat, Somayeh', 'Abrishami, Mojtaba']","['Zamani G', 'Ataei Azimi S', 'Aminizadeh A', 'Shams Abadi E', 'Kamandi M', 'Mortazi H', 'Shariat S', 'Abrishami M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2001-7929'],['eng'],['Letter'],20210108,Germany,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,Journal of ophthalmic inflammation and infection,101553216,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute macular Neuroretinopathy', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Coronavirus disease 2019', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:01,['2021/01/08 06:17'],"['2020/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12348-020-00231-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12348-020-00231-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect. 2021 Jan 8;10(1):39. doi: 10.1186/s12348-020-00231-1.,,,"['Eye Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Eye Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Eye Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. mojtaba_abrishami@yahoo.com.', 'Eye Research Center, Khatam-al-Anbia Eye Hospital, Qarani Blvd, Mashhad, 9195965919, Iran. mojtaba_abrishami@yahoo.com.']",,,,,,PMC7790518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conflicting results have been however reported between data emerged from sponsored clinical trials and from population-based registries. Moreover, no data are so far available for patients treated with frontline second-generation TKIs, excluding those from sponsored studies. We analyzed the mortality rate of 2315 CP-CML patients treated with frontline second-generation TKIs through the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) registries and compared it with the ISTAT mortality rate of the general population. The estimated differences show that the increased rate of mortality in CP-CML patients is less than 1% for the class 0-29 years, stable around 2% for the intervals 30-44 years and 45-59 years, and 1.4% for the interval 60-74 years; interestingly this rate is reduced for patients aged 75 years and more as compared to the general population (- 0.65%). The difference between potential and estimated deaths is higher among women in the age classes between 30 and 74 years.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Celant, Simone', 'Olimpieri, Pier Paolo', 'Olimpieri, Odoardo M', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Cirilli, Alessia', 'Colatrella, Antonietta', 'Gozzo, Lucia', 'Pugliese, Sara', 'Summa, Valentina', 'Foggi, Paolo', 'Corradini, Paolo', 'Russo, Pierluigi']","['Breccia M', 'Celant S', 'Olimpieri PP', 'Olimpieri OM', 'Pane F', 'Iurlo A', 'Cirilli A', 'Colatrella A', 'Gozzo L', 'Pugliese S', 'Summa V', 'Foggi P', 'Corradini P', 'Russo P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1163-6162'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210107,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Age', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Mortality', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:14'],"['2020/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:14 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04406-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04406-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Feb;100(2):481-485. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04406-1.

We explored the outcome of haploidentical donor (HID) transplantation for intermediate-risk AML and compared to that of matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants. One hundred twenty-seven consecutive patients with intermediate-risk AML in the first complete remission (CR1) who underwent allo-HSCT between January 1, 2015, and August 1, 2016, were enrolled. Thirty-seven patients received MSD grafts, and 90 received HID grafts. The 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) of the HID group was comparable to that of the MSD group: 82.0% +/- 4.1% versus 82.7% +/- 6.4%, P = 0.457. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse and transplantation-related mortality (TRM) were comparable between the HID and MSD groups (relapse, 4.5% +/- 0.1%, versus 11.5% +/- 0.3%, P = 0.550; TRM, 13.4% +/- 0.1% vs. 5.8% +/- 0.2%, P = 0.154). The HID recipients had a trend of a lower 2-year cumulative incidence of positive posttransplant flow cytometry (FCM+) and relapse than the MSD recipients (5.6% +/- 0.1% vs. 19.9% +/- 0.5%, P = 0.092). These results suggest that the outcomes of allo-HSCT with HIDs are comparable to those with MSDs in terms of LFS, TRM, and relapse for intermediate-risk AML in CR1. HIDs could be an alternative to MSDs for intermediate-risk AML.","['Ma, Yan-Ru', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Lv, Meng', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Wang, Yu']","['Ma YR', 'Xu LP', 'Zhang XH', 'Liu KY', 'Chang YJ', 'Lv M', 'Yan CH', 'Chen YH', 'Han W', 'Wang FR', 'Mo XD', 'Huang XJ', 'Wang Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1253-7465'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20210107,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Haploidentical donor', 'Intermediate-risk', 'Matched sibling donor']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:14'],"['2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:14 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04359-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04359-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Feb;100(2):555-562. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04359-x.

METHODS: The analysis dataset included 226 patients with AML. Quizartinib dihydrochloride was administered as daily doses of 20, 30, and 60 mg. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed using observed quizartinib and AC886 concentrations and time-matched mean electrocardiogram measurements. RESULTS: Observed QTcF increased with quizartinib and AC886 concentrations; the relationship was best described by a nonlinear maximum effect (Emax) model. The predicted mean increase in QTcF at the maximum concentration of quizartinib and AC886 associated with 60 mg/day was 21.1 ms (90% CI, 18.3-23.6 ms). Age, body weight, sex, race, baseline QTcF, QT-prolonging drug use, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia were not significant predictors of QTcF. Hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) was a statistically significant covariate affecting baseline QTcF, but no differences in QTcF (change in QTcF from baseline) were predicted between patients with versus without hypokalemia at the same quizartinib concentration. The use of concomitant QT-prolonging drugs did not increase QTcF further. CONCLUSION: QTcF increase was dependent on quizartinib and AC886 concentrations, but patient factors, including sex and age, did not affect the concentration-QTcF relationship. Because concomitant strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitor use significantly increases quizartinib concentration, these results support the clinical recommendation of quizartinib dose reduction in patients concurrently receiving a strong CYP3A inhibitor.

However, little is known about the roles of M-MDSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as opposed to their multiple roles in solid tumors. Methods: We examined the frequencies of M-MDSCs identified for CD14(+)HLA-DR(low/-) by flow cytometry in the peripheral circulating blood of 109 newly diagnosed adult patients with AML and 30 healthy controls (HC). Then, we, respectively, validated the clinic significance of circulating M-MDSCs on the relevance of spectral features for diagnostic stratification, induction therapy response, treatment effect maintenance, and long-term survival in AML. Results: Circulating M-MDSC frequencies of AML were significantly higher than those of HC both in CD14(+) monocytes (46.22% +/- 2.95% vs. 1.07% +/- 0.17%, p < 0.01) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (4.21% +/- 0.80% vs. 0.17% +/- 0.03%, p < 0.01). Elevated circulating M-MDSCs in patients with AML were significantly associated with low complete remission (CR) rate, high relapse/refractory rate, and poor long-term survival, but had no correlation with common clinic risks and cytogenetic molecular risk categories. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that circulating M-MDSCs are elevated and associated with poor prognosis in AML, suggesting M-MDSCs might be a prognostic indicator for AML.","['Wang, Huiping', 'Tao, Qianshan', 'Wang, Zhitao', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Xiao, Hao', 'Zhou, Mei', 'Dong, Yi', 'Zhai, Zhimin']","['Wang H', 'Tao Q', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang Q', 'Xiao H', 'Zhou M', 'Dong Y', 'Zhai Z']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1269-5850', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6685-6296']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201221,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/09/15 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:13'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:13 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/7363084 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2020 Dec 21;2020:7363084. doi: 10.1155/2020/7363084. eCollection 2020.,20210914,['Copyright (c) 2020 Huiping Wang et al.'],"['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.']",['0 (Biomarkers)'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology/*mortality', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,PMC7769680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High variant allele frequency (VAF) [> 0.48, P = 0.0089 for overall survival (OS), P = 0.13 for relapse-free survival (RFS)], multiple ITDs (> 1 ITDs, P = 0.011 for OS, P = 0.033 for RFS) and longer insertion length (> 69 bp, P = 0.14 for OS, P = 0.0078 for RFS) predicted poor survival. The study further proposed an easily applicable scoring model for OS using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation (LASSO) Cox regression model. Also, an independent cohort of 30 patients was used for external model validation. The mode was expressed as follows: 0.659 x FLT3-ITD VAF + 0.375 x FLT3-ITD number + 0.807 x Age + 0.688 x DNMT3A + 1.939 x U2AF1 (FLT3-ITD VAF > 0.48 scored 1; FLT3-ITD number scored 1 if carried 1 ITD, 2 if carried >/= 2 ITDs; age > 44 years scored 1, the presence of DNMT3A or U2AF1 scored 1; 0 for other conditions). It categorized patients into low-risk (L-R, score < 1, n = 20) and high-risk (H-R, score >/= 1, n = 61) groups based on the risk score with a significant difference in survival (3-year OS, P < 0.0001; 3-year RFS, P = 0.0005). A prognostic nomogram that integrated these five factors was developed with a concordance index calculation [OS: 0.68, 95% CI (0.64-0.72)].","['Zhang, Yi', 'Zhao, Bi-De', 'Wang, Cheng-Cheng', 'Wang, Yun-Gui', 'Wang, Hua-Feng', 'Wang, Jing-Han', 'Liu, Li-Xia', 'Lou, Feng', 'Cao, Shan-Bo', 'Hu, Xiao-Xia', 'Huang, Ai-Jie', 'Yang, Jian-Min', 'Meng, Hai-Tao', 'Yu, Wen-Juan', 'Tong, Hong-Yan', 'Wang, Jian-Min', 'Jin, Jie']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhao BD', 'Wang CC', 'Wang YG', 'Wang HF', 'Wang JH', 'Liu LX', 'Lou F', 'Cao SB', 'Hu XX', 'Huang AJ', 'Yang JM', 'Meng HT', 'Yu WJ', 'Tong HY', 'Wang JM', 'Jin J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3-ITD', 'LASSO cox regression', 'next-generation sequencing', 'prognosis']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:01,['2021/01/08 06:12'],"['2020/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:12 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2020 Dec 1;10(12):4527-4537. eCollection 2020.,,['AJCR Copyright (c) 2020.'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Hematology Oncology Diagnosis and Treatment Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'Acornmed Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

In recent years, more and more studies have been conducted on fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), the first rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These studies have found that FADS2 is abnormally expressed in cancers of the breast, lung, liver, and esophagus; melanoma; leukemia; and other malignant tumors. Furthermore, its expression is significantly correlated with tumor proliferation, cell migration and invasion, clonal formation, angiogenesis, ferroptosis, resistance to radiotherapy, histological grade, metastasis to lymph nodes, clinical stage, and prognosis. The abnormal expression of FADS2 results in an imbalance of cell membrane phospholipids, which disrupts the fluidity of the membrane structure and the transmission of signals and promotes the production of proinflammatory factors and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, ultimately harming human health. This article aims to systematically review the structural characteristics of FADS2; its function, expression, and mechanism of action; and the factors affecting its activity. This review also provides new ideas and strategies for the development of treatments aimed at the metabolic reprogramming of tumors.","['Li, Yan-Ling', 'Tian, Hao', 'Jiang, Jun', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Qi, Xiao-Wei']","['Li YL', 'Tian H', 'Jiang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Qi XW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201201,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fatty acid desaturase 2', 'expression', 'function', 'human cancer', 'metabolism']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:01,['2021/01/08 06:12'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:12 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2020 Dec 1;10(12):4098-4111. eCollection 2020.,,['AJCR Copyright (c) 2020.'],"['Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University Chongqing 400038, China.']",,,['None.'],,,PMC7783767,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is an increased risk of a second neoplasia in CLL, rarely hematological (in the myeloid lineage is even rarer). A 58-year-old male was diagnosed with CLL in 2012, remaining in regular surveillance until 2014. Then, the CLL progressed, and 6 cycles of rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide were prescribed with partial response. He remained in surveillance and suffered 2 episodes of autoimmune hemolytic anemia until 2019. Then, the hemolytic anemia relapsed and a neutrophilia became evident (progressing slowly), as well as a thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly without adenopathy were found. The bone marrow aspirate showed a chronic myeloproliferative disease without dysplasia. A peripheral blood search for the CSF3R mutation (T618I) was positive, also suggesting Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia (CNL). For a discrete monocytosis, a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was also considered. Hydroxyurea was then prescribed. The T618I CSF3R mutation is highly suggestive of CNL (being diagnostic criteria for CNL); however, this case may also suggest CMML as a possible diagnosis (there are other mutations in the CSF3R gene described for CMML, but not the T618I, which is highly exclusive of CNL according to the literature). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a possible CNL in a CLL patient (the opposite was already described in 1998).","['Couto, Maria Eduarda', 'Bizarro, Susana', 'Sousa, Domingos', 'Domingues, Nelson', 'Oliveira, Isabel', 'Martins, Gabriela', 'Teixeira, Manuel R', 'Mariz, Mario']","['Couto ME', 'Bizarro S', 'Sousa D', 'Domingues N', 'Oliveira I', 'Martins G', 'Teixeira MR', 'Mariz M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2092-0325', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4896-5982']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201221,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:01,['2021/01/08 06:12'],"['2020/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:12 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/6670965 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2020 Dec 21;2020:6670965. doi: 10.1155/2020/6670965. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Maria Eduarda Couto et al.'],"['Onco-hematology Department, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia Do Porto F.G.

This reflects the CML clones have not been eliminated completely. The precise mechanisms for the maintenance of CML cells are not yet fully understood. The bone marrow microenvironment constitutes the sanctuary for leukemic cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are an important component of the bone marrow microenvironment (BM). It plays an important role in the development and drug resistance of CML. Accumulating evidence indicates that exosomes play a vital role in cell-to-cell communication. We successfully isolated and purified exosomes from human bone marrow microenvironment-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSC-Exo) by serial centrifugation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hBMMSC-Exo on the proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance of CML cells. The results demonstrated that hBMMSC-Exo had the ability to inhibit the proliferation of CML cells in vitro via miR-15a and arrest cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. However, the results obtained from BALB/c nu/nu mice studies apparently contradicted the in vitro results. In fact, hBMMSC-Exo increased tumor incidence and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Further study showed the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression increased, whereas the Caspase3 expression decreased. Moreover, the in vivo study in the xenograft tumor model showed that hBMMSC-Exo promoted the proliferation and decreased the sensitivity of CML cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, resulting in drug resistance. These results demonstrated that hBMMSC-Exo supported the maintenance of CML cells and drug resistance in BM by cell-extrinsic protective mechanisms. They also suggested that hBMMSC-Exo might be a potential target to overcome the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance.","['Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Yang, Yazhi', 'Yang, Yang', 'Chen, Huijun', 'Tu, Huaijun', 'Li, Jian']","['Zhang X', 'Yang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Chen H', 'Tu H', 'Li J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3346-3314', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9169-8368', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2396-5342']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201213,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:01,['2021/01/08 06:11'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:11 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8890201 [doi]'],epublish,Stem Cells Int. 2020 Dec 13;2020:8890201. doi: 10.1155/2020/8890201. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Xiaoyan Zhang et al.'],"['The Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, The Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'Basic Medical School, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, The Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, The Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, The Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'The Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, The Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang, 330006 Jiangxi, China.']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,PMC7752271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suspecting it to be mucormycosis, the antifungal amphotericin B (AMB) was administered empirically, but the patient did not respond as planned. The fungus was then isolated from the biopsied tissue and morphologically identified as a species of Aspergillus. Necrosis progressed and she died of cerebral hemorrhage. Since Aspergillus flavus is susceptible to AMB, and several other Aspergillus species can be misidentified as A. flavus, the observed resistance necessitated a re-examination of the fungal isolate. Methods: The fungal strain was re-isolated and re-examined morphologically. Additionally, genomic DNA was extracted from the fungus and sequences were obtained from three genomic regions [the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and portions of the beta-tubulin and calmodulin genes] to more accurately identify this Aspergillus strain. Its antifungal susceptibility was assessed using multiple compounds and our findings were compared with literature data. Results: The fungal culture again yielded an Aspergillus isolate morphologically identical to A. flavus. Molecular analyses, however, revealed the strain to be A. nomiae, a close relative of A. flavus in section Flavi, and it exhibited resistance to AMB. Reviewing the literature, only five other cases of A. nomiae infection in humans have been reported worldwide. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: The rhinofacial mycosis of the patient was actually due to A. nomiae. The initial misidentification of the fungus, coupled with its resistance to AMB, could be the reason treatment did not help the patient.

However, the mechanisms of anti-cancer effect of VCX either as a monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer need investigation. Methods: Breast cancer cell lines with different molecular subtypes (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and SKBR-3) were treated with different concentrations of VCX for indicated time points. The expression of cell proliferative, apoptotic, and autophagy genes was determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. In addition, the percentage of MDA-MB-231 cells underwent apoptosis, expressed higher oxidative stress levels, and the changes in the cell cycle phases were determined by flow cytometry. Results: Treatment of human breast cancer cells with increasing concentrations of VCX caused a significant decrease in cells growth and proliferation. This effect was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic MDA-MB-231 cells and in the expression of the apoptotic genes, caspase 3, caspase 7, and BAX, with inhibition of anti-apoptotic gene, BCL-2 levels. Induction of apoptosis by VCX treatment induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase with inhibition of cell proliferator genes, cyclin D1 and E2F1. Furthermore, VCX treatment increased the formation of reactive oxygen species and the expression level of autophagy markers, Beclin 1 and LC3-II. Importantly, these cellular changes by VCX increased the chemo-sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to doxorubicin. Discussion: The present study explores the molecular mechanisms of VCX-mediated inhibitory effects on the growth and proliferation of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells through the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy. The study also explores the role of BCL-2 as a novel targeted therapy for breast cancer.","['Alhoshani, Ali', 'Alatawi, Fahad O', 'Al-Anazi, Fawaz E', 'Attafi, Ibraheem M', 'Zeidan, Asad', 'Agouni, Abdelali', 'El Gamal, Heba M', 'Shamoon, Licia S', 'Khalaf, Sarah', 'Korashy, Hesham M']","['Alhoshani A', 'Alatawi FO', 'Al-Anazi FE', 'Attafi IM', 'Zeidan A', 'Agouni A', 'El Gamal HM', 'Shamoon LS', 'Khalaf S', 'Korashy HM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3450-283X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3230-2279', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8353-2066', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5801-8500', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8363-1582', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5745-9643']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201231,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'MDA-MB-231 cells', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'breast cancer', 'cell cycle', 'venetoclax']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:01,['2021/01/08 06:10'],"['2020/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S281519 [doi]', '281519 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Dec 31;13:13357-13370. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S281519. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Alhoshani et al.'],"['Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Poison Control & Medical Forensic Chemistry Center, Jazan Health Affairs, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.']",,,"['The authors declare there is no conflict of interest.

Resistance occurred due to loss of surface expression of the antigen (rCD19-) or to the early disappearance or inactivation of CAR T cells (rCD19+). In a recently reported clinical case, rCD19- relapse resulted from masking of the antigen by the CAR at the surface of B-ALL leukemia cells following the unexpected viral transduction of a leukemic cell present in the cytapheresis sample. The objective of this work was to reproduce this epitope-masking resistance model, in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), based on our immunotherapeutic CAR T cell model targeting the accessory protein of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RAP) expressed by leukemic stem cells. As AML primary blasts express different levels of IL-1RAP, we modeled transduction of different AML tumor cell lines screened for density of antigenic sites with our lentiviral vectors carrying a third-generation IL-1RAP CAR, an iCASP9 suicide gene, and a truncated CD19 surface gene. We demonstrated that primary AML blasts can be easily transduced (74.55 +/- 21.29%, n = 4) and that CAR T cytotoxicity to IL-1RAP is inversely correlated with epitope masking in relation to the number of antigenic sites expressed on the surface of IL-1RAP+ lines. Importantly, we showed that, in vitro, a 24-h exposure of IL-1RAP+/CAR+ leukemia lines to Rimiducid eliminated >85% of the cells. We confirmed that the expression of IL-1RAP CAR by an IL-1RAP+ leukemic cell, by decreasing the membrane availability of the targeted antigen, can induce resistance while a high epitope density maintains sensitivity to CAR T cells. Moreover, the presence of the iCASP9/Rimiducid suicide system safety switch makes this immunotherapy approach safe for application in a future phase 1 clinical trial.","['Warda, Walid', 'Da Rocha, Mathieu Neto', 'Trad, Rim', 'Haderbache, Rafik', 'Salma, Yahya', 'Bouquet, Lucie', 'Roussel, Xavier', 'Nicod, Clementine', 'Deschamps, Marina', 'Ferrand, Christophe']","['Warda W', 'Da Rocha MN', 'Trad R', 'Haderbache R', 'Salma Y', 'Bouquet L', 'Roussel X', 'Nicod C', 'Deschamps M', 'Ferrand C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0119-3919'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:08'],"['2020/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:08 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-020-00284-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-020-00284-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2021 Dec;28(12):1365-1375. doi: 10.1038/s41417-020-00284-3.

Mutations in U2AF1 are frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes. However, the role of wild-type U2AF1 in normal hematopoiesis has remained elusive. Using a novel conditional U2af1 knockout allele, we have found that deletion of U2af1 results in profound defects in hematopoiesis characterized by pancytopenia, ablation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) leading to bone marrow failure and early lethality in mice. U2af1 deletion impairs HSPC function and repopulation capacity. U2af1 deletion also causes increased DNA damage and reduced survival in hematopoietic progenitors. RNA sequencing analysis reveals significant alterations in the expression of genes related to HSC maintenance, cell proliferation, and DNA damage response-related pathways in U2af1-deficient HSPC. U2af1 deficiency also induces splicing alterations in genes important for HSPC function. This includes altered splicing and perturbed expression of Nfya and Pbx1 transcription factors in U2af1-deficient HSPC. Collectively, these results suggest an important role for U2af1 in the maintenance and function of HSPC in normal hematopoiesis. A better understanding of the normal function of U2AF1 in hematopoiesis is important for development of appropriate therapeutic approaches for U2AF1 mutant induced hematologic malignancies.","['Dutta, Avik', 'Yang, Yue', 'Le, Bao T', 'Zhang, Yifan', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Zang, Chongzhi', 'Mohi, Golam']","['Dutta A', 'Yang Y', 'Le BT', 'Zhang Y', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Zang C', 'Mohi G']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7530-4784'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:07'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:07 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01116-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01116-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Aug;35(8):2382-2398. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01116-x.

Although acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has in principle been shown to be a T cell-sensitive disease by the graft-versus-leukemia activity of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, T cell therapy has so far failed in this setting. This is largely due to the lack of target structures both sufficiently selective and uniformly expressed on AML, causing unacceptable myeloid cell toxicity. To address this, we developed a modular and controllable MHC-unrestricted adoptive T cell therapy platform tailored to AML. This platform combines synthetic agonistic receptor (SAR) -transduced T cells with AML-targeting tandem single chain variable fragment (scFv) constructs. Construct exchange allows SAR T cells to be redirected toward alternative targets, a process enabled by the short half-life and controllability of these antibody fragments. Combining SAR-transduced T cells with the scFv constructs resulted in selective killing of CD33(+) and CD123(+) AML cell lines, as well as of patient-derived AML blasts. Durable responses and persistence of SAR-transduced T cells could also be demonstrated in AML xenograft models. Together these results warrant further translation of this novel platform for AML treatment.","['Benmebarek, Mohamed-Reda', 'Cadilha, Bruno L', 'Herrmann, Monika', 'Lesch, Stefanie', 'Schmitt, Saskia', 'Stoiber, Stefan', 'Darwich, Abbass', 'Augsberger, Christian', 'Brauchle, Bettina', 'Rohrbacher, Lisa', 'Oner, Arman', 'Seifert, Matthias', 'Schwerdtfeger, Melanie', 'Gottschlich, Adrian', 'Rataj, Felicitas', 'Fenn, Nadja C', 'Klein, Christian', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Endres, Stefan', 'Hopfner, Karl-Peter', 'Kobold, Sebastian']","['Benmebarek MR', 'Cadilha BL', 'Herrmann M', 'Lesch S', 'Schmitt S', 'Stoiber S', 'Darwich A', 'Augsberger C', 'Brauchle B', 'Rohrbacher L', 'Oner A', 'Seifert M', 'Schwerdtfeger M', 'Gottschlich A', 'Rataj F', 'Fenn NC', 'Klein C', 'Subklewe M', 'Endres S', 'Hopfner KP', 'Kobold S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7594-7280', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4528-8357', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5612-4673']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:07'],"['2020/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:07 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01109-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01109-w [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Aug;35(8):2243-2257. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01109-w.

After a median follow-up of 50 days, mortality was higher than in the general population and reached 48% in myelofibrosis (MF). Univariate analysis, showed a significant relationship between death and age, male gender, decreased lymphocyte counts, need for respiratory support, comorbidities and diagnosis of MF, while no association with essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and prefibrotic-PMF (pre-PMF) was found. Regarding MPN-directed therapy ongoing at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, Ruxolitinib (Ruxo) was significantly more frequent in patients who died in comparison with survivors (p = 0.006). Conversely, multivariable analysis found no effect of Ruxo alone on mortality, but highlighted an increased risk of death in the 11 out of 45 patients who discontinued treatment. These findings were also confirmed in a propensity score matching analysis. In conclusion, we found a high risk of mortality during COVID-19 infection among MPN patients, especially in MF patients and/or discontinuing Ruxo at COVID-19 diagnosis. These findings call for deeper investigation on the role of Ruxo treatment and its interruption, in affecting mortality in MPN patients with COVID-19.","['Barbui, Tiziano', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria', 'Alvarez-Larran, Alberto', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Masciulli, Arianna', 'Carobbio, Alessandra', 'Ghirardi, Arianna', 'Ferrari, Alberto', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', 'Elli, Elena', 'Andrade-Campos, Marcio Miguel', 'Kabat, Mercedes Gasior', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jaques', 'Palandri, Francesca', 'Benevolo, Giulia', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Fox, Maria Laura', 'Foncillas, Maria Angeles', 'Morcillo, Carmen Montoya', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Osorio, Santiago', 'Papadopoulos, Petros', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Cervantes, Keina Susana Quiroz', 'Serrano, Miguel Sagues', 'Carreno-Tarragona, Gonzalo', 'Sobas, Marta Anna', 'Lunghi, Francesca', 'Patriarca, Andrea', 'Elorza, Begona Navas', 'Angona, Anna', 'Mazo, Elena Magro', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Ruggeri, Marco', 'Cuevas, Beatriz', 'Hernandez-Boluda, Juan Carlos', 'Abadia, Emma Lopez', 'Cirici, Blanca Xicoy', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Garrote, Marta', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Daffini, Rosa', 'Cavalca, Fabrizio', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Benajiba, Lina', 'Curto-Garcia, Natalia', 'Bellini, Marta', 'Betti, Silvia', 'De Stefano, Valerio', 'Harrison, Claire', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Barbui T', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Alvarez-Larran A', 'Iurlo A', 'Masciulli A', 'Carobbio A', 'Ghirardi A', 'Ferrari A', 'Rossi G', 'Elli E', 'Andrade-Campos MM', 'Kabat MG', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Palandri F', 'Benevolo G', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Fox ML', 'Foncillas MA', 'Morcillo CM', 'Rumi E', 'Osorio S', 'Papadopoulos P', 'Bonifacio M', 'Cervantes KSQ', 'Serrano MS', 'Carreno-Tarragona G', 'Sobas MA', 'Lunghi F', 'Patriarca A', 'Elorza BN', 'Angona A', 'Mazo EM', 'Koschmieder S', 'Ruggeri M', 'Cuevas B', 'Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Abadia EL', 'Cirici BX', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Garrote M', 'Cattaneo D', 'Daffini R', 'Cavalca F', 'Bellosillo B', 'Benajiba L', 'Curto-Garcia N', 'Bellini M', 'Betti S', 'De Stefano V', 'Harrison C', 'Rambaldi A']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2747-6327', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4401-0812', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9664-7084', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8367-5668', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3511-0504', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7572-9504', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8342-329X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0716-1686', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9570-5542', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1011-8171', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4289-3113', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1809-284X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5178-5827', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3739-7502']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/02/16 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:07'],"['2020/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:07 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01107-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01107-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):485-493. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01107-y.

Cumulative 10-year rates of MMR and MR(4.5) were higher with nilotinib (300 mg twice daily [BID], 77.7% and 61.0%, respectively; 400 mg BID, 79.7% and 61.2%, respectively) than with imatinib (400 mg once daily [QD], 62.5% and 39.2%, respectively). Cumulative rates of TFR eligibility at 10 years were higher with nilotinib (300 mg BID, 48.6%; 400 mg BID, 47.3%) vs imatinib (29.7%). Estimated 10-year overall survival rates in nilotinib and imatinib arms were 87.6%, 90.3%, and 88.3%, respectively. Overall frequency of adverse events was similar with nilotinib and imatinib. By 10 years, higher cumulative rates of cardiovascular events were reported with nilotinib (300 mg BID, 16.5%; 400 mg BID, 23.5%) vs imatinib (3.6%), including in Framingham low-risk patients. Overall efficacy and safety results support the use of nilotinib 300 mg BID as frontline therapy for optimal long-term outcomes, especially in patients aiming for TFR. The benefit-risk profile in context of individual treatment goals should be carefully assessed.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Issaragrisil, Surapol', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Boquimpani, Carla', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Dubruille, Viviane', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Medras, Ewa', 'Zanichelli, Maria', 'Bendit, Israel', 'Cacciatore, Silvia', 'Titorenko, Ksenia', 'Aimone, Paola', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Hughes TP', 'Larson RA', 'Kim DW', 'Issaragrisil S', 'le Coutre P', 'Etienne G', 'Boquimpani C', 'Pasquini R', 'Clark RE', 'Dubruille V', 'Flinn IW', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Medras E', 'Zanichelli M', 'Bendit I', 'Cacciatore S', 'Titorenko K', 'Aimone P', 'Saglio G', 'Hochhaus A']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9168-3203', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3967-4267', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1261-3299']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:07'],"['2020/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:07 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01111-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01111-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):440-453. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01111-2.

However, little is known about the role of Nrf2 in tumor mutation burden and the effect of Nrf2 in modulating DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we show that Nrf2 expression is associated with tumor mutation burden in AML. Patients with Nrf2 overexpression had a higher frequency of gene mutation and drug resistance. Nrf2 overexpression protected the AML cells from apoptosis induced by cytarabine in vitro and increased the risk of drug resistance associated with a gene mutation in vivo. Furthermore, Nrf2 overexpression inhibited MutS Homolog 2 (MSH2) protein expression, which caused DNA MMR deficiency. Mechanistically, the inhibition of MSH2 by Nrf2 was in a ROS-independent manner. Further studies showed that an increased activation of JNK/c-Jun signaling in Nrf2 overexpression cells inhibited the expression of the MSH2 protein.

CAR-T is expensive partly due to the restricted use of each CAR construct for specific tumors. Thus, a CAR construct with broad antitumor activity can be advantageous. We identified that CD126 is expressed by many hematologic and solid tumors, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and malignant melanoma among others. CAR-T cells targeting CD126 were generated and shown to kill many tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner and with efficiency directly proportional to CD126 expression. Soluble CD126 did not interfere with CAR-T cell killing. The CAR-T constructs bind murine CD126 but caused no weight loss or hepatotoxicity in mice. In multiple myeloma and prostate adenocarcinoma xenograft models, intravenously injected CD126 CAR-T cells infiltrated within, expanded, and killed tumor cells without toxicity. Binding of soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) by CAR-T cells could mitigate cytokine release syndrome. Murine SAA-3 levels were lower in mice injected with CD126 CAR-T compared to controls, suggesting that binding of sIL-6R by CAR-T cells could mitigate cytokine release syndrome. CD126 provides a novel therapeutic target for CAR-T cells for many tumors with a low risk of toxicity.","['Mishra, Ameet K', 'Kemler, Iris', 'Dingli, David']","['Mishra AK', 'Kemler I', 'Dingli D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6491-7278', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7477-3004']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210104,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:05'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/08 06:05 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-020-00405-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-020-00405-z [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2021 Jan 4;11(1):3. doi: 10.1038/s41408-020-00405-z.,20210806,,"['Division of Hematology, 200 First Street SW, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, 200 First Street SW, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. dingli.david@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. dingli.david@mayo.edu.']","['0 (IL6R protein, human)', '0 (Il6ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation']",,,['P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7791061,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we observed that CHK1 inhibition induces apoptosis in a subset of acute leukemia cell lines in vitro, including TP53-null acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and BCR/ABL-positive acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and inhibits leukemic colony formation in clinical AML samples ex vivo. In further studies, downregulation or inhibition of CHK1 triggered signaling in sensitive human acute leukemia cell lines that involved CDK2 activation followed by AP1-dependent TNF transactivation, TNFalpha production, and engagement of a TNFR1- and BID-dependent apoptotic pathway. AML lines that were intrinsically resistant to CHK1 inhibition exhibited high CHK1 expression and were sensitized by CHK1 downregulation. Signaling through this same CDK2-AP1-TNF cytotoxic pathway was also initiated by ATR or WEE1 inhibitors in vitro and during CHK1 inhibitor treatment of AML xenografts in vivo. Collectively, these observations not only identify new contributors to the antileukemic cell action of CHK1, ATR, and WEE1 inhibitors, but also delineate a previously undescribed pathway leading from aberrant CDK2 activation to death ligand-induced killing that can potentially be exploited for acute leukemia treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that replication checkpoint inhibitors can kill AML cells through a pathway involving AP1-mediated TNF gene activation and subsequent TP53-independent, TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, which can potentially be exploited clinically.","['Ding, Husheng', 'Vincelette, Nicole D', 'McGehee, Cordelia D', 'Kohorst, Mira A', 'Koh, Brian D', 'Venkatachalam, Annapoorna', 'Meng, X Wei', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Flatten, Karen S', 'Peterson, Kevin L', 'Correia, Cristina', 'Lee, Sun-Hee', 'Patnaik, Mrinal', 'Webster, Jonathan A', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Li, Hu', 'Karnitz, Larry M', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Ding H', 'Vincelette ND', 'McGehee CD', 'Kohorst MA', 'Koh BD', 'Venkatachalam A', 'Meng XW', 'Schneider PA', 'Flatten KS', 'Peterson KL', 'Correia C', 'Lee SH', 'Patnaik M', 'Webster JA', 'Ghiaur G', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Pratz KW', 'Li H', 'Karnitz LM', 'Kaufmann SH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9464-7555', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3647-6345', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0903-7390', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4754-127X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4900-7145']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-20-1504 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-1504 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 May 15;81(10):2666-2678. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-1504.

These cancer stem-like cells have been assumed to have unique properties, including the capability of self-renewing and giving rise to ""differentiated"" or non-LICs that make up the whole tumor. Cell populations enriched with LIC activity have been characterized in different hematopoietic malignancies, including human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Related studies have also demonstrated that LICs are functionally distinct from bulk cells and modulated by distinct molecular signaling pathways and epigenetic mechanisms. Here we review several biological and clinical aspects related to LICs in ALL, including (i) immunophenotypic characterization of LIC-enriched subsets in human and mouse models of ALL, (ii) emerging therapeutics against regulatory signaling pathways involved in LIC progression and maintenance in T- and B-cell leukemias, (iii) novel epigenetic and age-related mechanisms of LIC propagation, and (iv) ongoing efforts in immunotherapy to eradicate LIC-enriched cell subsets in relapsed and refractory ALL cases. Current conventional treatments do not efficiently eliminate LICs. Therefore, innovative therapeutics that exclusively target LICs hold great promise for developing an effective cure for ALL.","['Tamiro, Francesco', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Giambra, Vincenzo']","['Tamiro F', 'Weng AP', 'Giambra V']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7394-5425', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2607-2080']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210107,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,,2021/01/09 06:00,2022/01/08 06:00,['2021/01/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-20-2571 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2571 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 Aug 15;81(16):4165-4173. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2571.

Antimetabolites including methotrexate are a common cause for direct DILI. Hepatotoxicity associated with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is generally transient and includes reversible elevation of transaminase in up to 60% and associated hyperbilirubinaemia (</=grade 2) in 25% of courses and therefore is of no clinical significance.

METHODS: Sixty female SD rats were randomly divided into the Sham control group, aging model group, Res treatment group, SIF treatment group, Res combined with SIF treatment group and estrogen replacement therapy group(ERT group). Rats with aging were induced by bilateral ovariectomy combined with intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose. TUNEL and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe apoptosis and ultrastructural changes of mitochondrion in hippocampus, respectively. The activities of superoxide dismutase(SOD), catalase(CAT), glutathione peroxidase(GSH-Px) and content of Malonaldehyde(MDA) were detected in the hippocampal homogenate. The protein expressions of cytochrome C oxidase(COX) , Bcl-2 associated X protein(Bax)B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2(Bcl-2) and cytochrome C were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the Sham control group, the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the apoptotic index(AI) in the model group increased. Marked increase of mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation, decrease of mitochondrial integrity were also observed in the model group. Additionally, the levels of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px were decreased and the level of MDA was increased in the model group in the hippocampus, Bax and cytochrome C protein expression increased, and the COX protein expression and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decreased(P&lt;0. 05). In compared with the model group, the number of TUNEL-positive cells and AI significantly decreased, mitochondrial integrity improved in all of the treatment groups, the COX protein expression significantly up-regulated, Bax and cytochrome C protein expression down-regulated, and the protein expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax increased(P&lt;0. 05 or P&lt;0. 01). Compared with the Res alone and SIF alone treatment group, Res combined SIF treatment decreased the AI and Bax, cytochrome C protein expression, moreover, increased the mitochondrial integrity rate, COX and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression ratio(P&lt;0. 05). There was no statistically significant difference in Bcl-2 protein expression among all the groups(P&gt;0. 05). CONCLUSION: Res and SIF alone and in combination decreased apoptosisinduced by oxidative stress in hippocampus of aging model rats, and beneficial effect in the Res combined SIF treatment group is more significant than that in the alone administration. Improving the antioxidant capacity, increasing the protein expressions of COX andthe ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax, and inhibiting the release of cytochrome C may be the mechanisms by which Res and SIF improve apoptosis in aging rats.","['Song, Chenmeng', 'Zhang, Yusen', 'Cheng, Le', 'Zhang, Luping', 'Li, Xuemin', 'Shi, Mengqian', 'Zhao, Haifeng']","['Song C', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng L', 'Zhang L', 'Li X', 'Shi M', 'Zhao H']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Wei Sheng Yan Jiu,Wei sheng yan jiu = Journal of hygiene research,9426367,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['aging', 'apoptosis', 'mitochondria', 'oxidative stress', 'resveratrol', 'soy isoflavones']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2021/01/08 05:48'],"['2021/01/08 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.19813/j.cnki.weishengyanjiu.2020.06.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Wei Sheng Yan Jiu. 2020 Nov;49(6):932-937. doi: 10.19813/j.cnki.weishengyanjiu.2020.06.010.,20210111,,"['Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Shanxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']","['0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Hippocampus/metabolism', '*Isoflavones/pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Resveratrol/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BIRC3 (cellular IAP2) and BIRC5 (survivin) are two of the eight members of the human IAPs family. This family is characterized by the presence of the baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains, involved in protein-protein interactions. In addition to the BIR domains, IAPs also contain other important domains like the C-terminal ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, the caspase recruitment (CARD) domain and the C-terminal Ring zinc-finger (RING) domain. MAIN BODY: BIRC3 and BIRC5 have been characterized in some solid and hematological tumors and are therapeutic targets for the family of drugs called ""Smac mimetics"". Many evidences point to the pro-survival and antiapoptotic role of BIRC3 in cancer cells, however, not all the data are consistent and the resulting picture is heterogeneous. For instance, BIRC3 genetic inactivation due to deletions or point mutations is consistently associated to shorter progression free survival and poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. BIRC3 inactivation has also been associated to chemoimmunotherapy resistance. On the contrary, the progression from low grade gliomas to high grade gliomas is accompanied by BIRC3 expression increase, which bears relevant prognostic consequences. Due to the relationship between BIRC3, MAP3K14 and the non-canonical NF-kB pathway, BIRC3 inactivation bears consequences also on the tumor cells relying on NF-kB pathway to survive. BIRC5, on the contrary, is commonly considered an anti-apoptotic molecule, promoting cell division and tumor progression and it is widely regarded as potential therapeutic target. CONCLUSIONS: The present manuscript collects and reviews the most recent literature concerning the role played by BIRC3 and BIRC5 in cancer cells, providing useful information for the choice of the best therapeutic targets.","['Frazzi, Raffaele']",['Frazzi R'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1822-745X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210107,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,['NOTNLM'],"['BIRC3', 'BIRC5', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'IAP proteins', 'Smac-mimetics']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/01/09 06:01,['2021/01/08 05:48'],"['2020/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-020-00521-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13578-020-00521-0 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2021 Jan 7;11(1):8. doi: 10.1186/s13578-020-00521-0.,,,"['Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale - IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Viale Risorgimento 80, Reggio Emilia, Italy. raffaele.frazzi@ausl.re.it.']",,,,,,PMC7792207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 10% of absorbed clopidogrel is metabolized to active forms by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the liver and 90% to inactive clopidogrel carboxylate by esterases. OBJECTIVE: Since different forms of clopidogrel have cytotoxic potential, our aim was to determine the effect of 7.5, 40, and 75muM clopidogrel over DNA damage in adipocytes and hepatocytes. METHODS: In the present study, DNA damage was investigated by Comet analysis using 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Alpha Mouse 12 (AML-12) hepatocytes. RESULTS: DNA fragmentation was found to be increased as a response to 7.5 muM, 40 muM, and 75 muM clopidogrel treatment compared to non-treated control groups in AML-12 hepatocytes (p<0.01, p<0.001, p<0.01 respectively) and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.001respectively). DNA damage levels as a response to clopidogrel treatment were found to be higher in 3T3-L1 adipocytes than AML-12 hepatocytes. Also, DNA damage levels in adipocytes and hepatocytes were found to increase dose-dependently for 7.5 and 40 muM clopidogrel, whereas decreased as a response to 75 muM. CONCLUSION: According to our results, clopidogrel results in more DNA damage in adipocytes than in hepatocytes. The molecular mechanism of clopidogrel genotoxicity needs to be further investigated especially in adipose tissue.","['Bayar, Elif', 'Cevik, Mehtap', 'Caker, Selen', 'Cagatay, Penbe', 'Susleyici, Belgin']","['Bayar E', 'Cevik M', 'Caker S', 'Cagatay P', 'Susleyici B']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Saf,Current drug safety,101270895,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['3T3-L1 adipocytes', 'AML-12 hepatocytes', 'DNA damage', 'DNA fragmentation.', 'cell culture', 'clopidogrel']",2021/01/09 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/08 05:41'],"['2020/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/08 05:41 [entrez]']","['CDS-EPUB-113101 [pii]', '10.2174/1574886315666210106141936 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Saf. 2021;16(3):252-258. doi: 10.2174/1574886315666210106141936.,20211210,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Division of Biology, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Division of Biology, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Division of Biology, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Services and Techniques, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Division of Biology, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['A74586SNO7 (Clopidogrel)'],"['3T3-L1 Cells', '*Adipocytes', 'Animals', 'Clopidogrel/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice']",,,"['FEN-C-YLP-250816-0418/Marmara University Scientifical Research Projects', 'Commission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For over four decades, therapeutic options for AML were limited to high dose cytotoxic chemotherapy. Scientific breakthroughs have not only enhanced our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of this disease but also resulted in the development of several targeted therapies with superior efficacy and lesser toxicities than conventional chemotherapy. The FDA approval of small molecule inhibitors for specific AML subsets highlights the importance of genetic and molecular profiling to optimally personalize AML therapy in the modern era. Areas covered: In this article, we review the medical literature from PubMed on recent FDA approved drugs for AML by their mechanism of action: small molecule inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugate, cytotoxic, and epigenetic agents. We describe how to incorporate these agents into the current treatment paradigm for specific AML patients. Expert opinion: Knowing the molecular characteristics of patients with AML is of utmost importance to plan the best management. There are promising drugs targeting leukemogenesis by various mechanisms. It is important to consider clinical trial options for patients if and when available.

Deptor is capable of inhibiting the kinase activity of mTOR. It is well known that the mTOR pathway is involved in various signaling pathways that are involved with various biological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, and the ER stress response. Therefore, Deptor, being a natural inhibitor of mTOR, has become very important in its study. Because of this, it is important to research its role regarding the development and progression of human malignancies, especially in hematologic malignancies. Due to its variation in expression in cancer, it has been suggested that Deptor can act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the cellular or tissue context. This review discusses recent advances in its transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of Deptor.

RNA m(6)A methylation is controlled by a multiprotein ""writer"" complex including the enzymatic factor methyltransferase-like protein 3 (METTL3) that regulates methylation and two ""eraser"" proteins, RNA demethylase ALKBH5 (ALKBH5) and fat mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO), that demethylate m(6)A in transcripts. FTO can also demethylate N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m(6)Am), which is found adjacent to the m(7)G cap structure in mRNA. FTO has recently gained interest as a potential cancer target, and small molecule FTO inhibitors such as meclofenamic acid have been shown to prevent tumor progression in both acute myeloid leukemia and glioblastoma in vivo models. However, current FTO inhibitors are unsuitable for clinical applications due to either poor target selectivity or poor pharmacokinetics. In this work, we describe the structure-based design, synthesis, and biochemical evaluation of a new class of FTO inhibitors. Rational design of 20 small molecules with low micromolar IC50's and specificity toward FTO over ALKBH5 identified two competitive inhibitors FTO-02 and FTO-04. Importantly, FTO-04 prevented neurosphere formation in patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) without inhibiting the growth of healthy neural stem cell-derived neurospheres. Finally, FTO-04 increased m(6)A and m(6)Am levels in GSCs consistent with FTO inhibition. These results support FTO-04 as a potential new lead for treatment of glioblastoma.","['Huff, Sarah', 'Tiwari, Shashi Kant', 'Gonzalez, Gwendolyn M', 'Wang, Yinsheng', 'Rana, Tariq M']","['Huff S', 'Tiwari SK', 'Gonzalez GM', 'Wang Y', 'Rana TM']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9558-5766'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210107,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,IM,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2021/01/07 20:09'],"['2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 20:09 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.0c00841 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2021 Feb 19;16(2):324-333. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.0c00841.

The T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and the functionally normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), that is, CD34(+) /CD38(-) /ALDH(+) cells for AML with rare-ALDH(+) blasts (<1.9% ALDH(+) cells) were defined as the nonleukemia compartments. WES identified 62 point-mutations in the leukemia compartment derived from 12 AML-patients at the time of diagnosis and 73 mutations in 3 matched relapse cases. Most patients (8/12) showed 4 to 6 point-mutations per sample at diagnosis. Other than the mutations in the recurrently mutated genes such as DNMT3A, NRAS and KIT, we were able to identify novel point-mutations that have not yet been described in AML. Some leukemia-specific mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities including DNMT3A(R882H), EZH2(I146T) and inversion(16) were also detectable in the respective T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and HSC in 5/12 patients, suggesting that preleukemia HSC might represent the source of leukemogenesis for these cases. The leukemic evolution was reconstructed for five cases with detectable preleukemia clones, which were tracked in follow-up and relapse samples. Four of the five patients with detectable preleukemic mutations developed relapse. The presence of leukemia-specific mutations in these nonleukemia compartments, especially after chemotherapy or after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, is highly relevant, as these could be responsible for relapse. This discovery may facilitate the identification of novel targets for long-term cure.","['Saeed, Borhan R', 'Manta, Linda', 'Raffel, Simon', 'Pyl, Paul Theodor', 'Buss, Eike C', 'Wang, Wenwen', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Huber, Wolfgang', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Lutz, Christoph']","['Saeed BR', 'Manta L', 'Raffel S', 'Pyl PT', 'Buss EC', 'Wang W', 'Eckstein V', 'Jauch A', 'Trumpp A', 'Huber W', 'Ho AD', 'Lutz C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9811-3916'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210118,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*clonal evolution', '*hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)', '*relapse']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/01/07 17:21'],"['2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 17:21 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.33461 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2021 Jun 1;148(11):2825-2838. doi: 10.1002/ijc.33461.

Genome-wide association studies have identified IKZF1 as a strong acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility locus in children both with and without Down syndrome, with association signals reported at rs4132601 in non-Down syndrome and rs58923657 in individuals with Down syndrome (r2 = 0.98 for these two loci). Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in non-Down syndrome lymphoblastoid cell lines has demonstrated an association between the rs4132601 risk allele and decreased IKZF1 mRNA levels. In this study, we provide further mechanistic evidence linking the region encompassing IKZF1-associated polymorphisms to pro-leukemogenic effects in both human lymphoblastoid cell lines and murine hematopoietic stem cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the region encompassing the rs17133807 major allele (r2 with rs58923657 = 0.97) resulted in significant reduction of IKZF1 mRNA levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines, with a greater effect in Down syndrome versus non-Down syndrome cells. Since rs17133807 is highly conserved in mammals, we also evaluated the orthologous murine locus at rs263378223, in hematopoietic stem cells from the Dp16(1)Yey mouse model of Down syndrome as well as non-Down syndrome control mice. Homozygous deletion of the region encompassing rs263378223 resulted in significantly reduced Ikzf1 mRNA, confirming that this polymorphism maps to a strong murine Ikzf1 enhancer, and resulted in increased B-lymphoid colony growth and decreased B-lineage differentiation. Our results suggest that both the region encompassing rs17133807 and its conserved orthologous mouse locus have functional effects that may mediate increased leukemia susceptibility in both the Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome genetic backgrounds.","['Gant, Vincent U', 'Junco, Jacob J', 'Terrell, Maci', 'Rashid, Raushan', 'Rabin, Karen R']","['Gant VU', 'Junco JJ', 'Terrell M', 'Rashid R', 'Rabin KR']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3416-230X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2435-7739']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2021/01/07 17:19'],"['2020/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 17:19 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0244863 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-24833 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Jan 7;16(1):e0244863. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0244863. eCollection 2021.,20210510,,"['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']","['Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Down Syndrome/complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,"['P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR024574/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7790404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: AALL0932 enrolled 9,229 patients with B-ALL; 2,364 average-risk (AR) patients were randomly assigned (2 x 2 factorial design) at the start of maintenance therapy to vincristine/dexamethasone pulses every 4 (VCR/DEX4) or every 12 (VCR/DEX12) weeks, and a starting dose of weekly oral methotrexate of 20 mg/m(2) (MTX20) or 40 mg/m(2) (MTX40). RESULTS: Five-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) from enrollment (with 95% CIs), for all eligible and evaluable SR B-ALL patients (n = 9,226), were 92.0% (91.1% and 92.8%) and 96.8% (96.2% and 97.3%), respectively. The 5-year DFS and OS from the start of maintenance for randomly assigned AR patients were 94.6% (93.3% and 95.9%) and 98.5% (97.7% and 99.2%), respectively. The 5-year DFS and OS for patients randomly assigned to receive VCR/DEX4 (n = 1,186) versus VCR/DEX12 (n = 1,178) were 94.1% (92.2% and 96.0%) and 98.3% (97.2% and 99.4%) v 95.1% (93.3% and 96.9%) and 98.6% (97.7% and 99.6%), respectively (P = .86 and .69). The 5-year DFS and OS for AR patients randomly assigned to receive MTX20 versus MTX40 were 95.1% (93.3% and 96.8%) and 98.8% (97.9% and 99.7%) v 94.2% (92.2% and 96.1%) and 98.1% (97.0% and 99.2%), respectively (P = .92 and .89). CONCLUSIONS: The 0NCI-SR AR B-ALL who received VCR/DEX12 had outstanding outcomes despite receiving one third of the vincristine/dexamethasone pulses previously used as standard of care on Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials.

METHODS: Single case report. RESULTS: A 69-year-old man with a past medical history of CLL diagnosed 1 year prior was referred with a foveal lesion in the right eye (OD), and was found to have hyperopic shift OD. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated choroidal infiltration OD, and Computed Tomography (CT) of the orbits demonstrated a left orbital mass. Biopsy of the left orbital mass confirmed CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia. Oral Ibrutinib monotherapy of 140mg three times daily was initiated for treatment of these choroidal and orbital metastases, and at 6 months there was clinical resolution of disease. Cessation of Ibrutinib monotherapy was followed 7 months later by recurrence of choroidal disease. Reinitiation of Ibrutinib monotherapy 140mg three times daily led again to clinical disease resolution, and durable remission has been attained on a well-tolerated low maintenance dose of Ibrutinib 140mg two times daily. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of control of choroidal and orbital metastasis of CLL with Ibrutinib monotherapy, confirmed with choroidal recurrence on drug cessation and clinical resolution of disease on re-treatment.","['Sieburth, Rebecca M', 'Weaver, Christopher D', 'Kirzhner, Maria', 'Shildkrot, Yevgeniy']","['Sieburth RM', 'Weaver CD', 'Kirzhner M', 'Shildkrot Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210112,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,IM,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2021/01/07 15:26'],"['2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 15:26 [entrez]']","['10.1097/ICB.0000000000001118 [doi]', '01271216-900000000-98461 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2021 Jan 12. pii: 01271216-900000000-98461. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0000000000001118.,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.']",,,['Conflicts of Interest: All authors have no financial disclosures.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: GeneChip((R)) screening is used for elucidating various chemoresistance-related gene expression in the adriamycin-resistant leukaemia cells K562/ADR. We constructed K562/CD44 cells by transfection of an EGFP-SV40-CD44 plasmid, and adriamycin-resistant ability was confirmed by detecting migration and apoptosis-related proteins and mRNA expression using Western blotting and Real-time PCR respectively. RESULTS: K562/CD44 cells were generated by the transfection of an EGFP-SV40-CD44 plasmid with high CD44 expression. mRNA expression levels of CD44 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), along with the proliferation rate, were increased, while the apoptosis rate of K562/CD44 cells was decreased. Migration-associated proteins such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 were upregulated, whereas apoptosis-related protein Bax was downregulated and Bcl-2 protein was not significantly altered in the K562/CD44 cells. CONCLUSIONS: CD44 might be involved in adriamycin resistance via regulation of P-gp, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Bcl-2/Bax.","['Li, Juan', 'Zhang, Yanfang', 'Cui, Yubo', 'Jin, Honghua', 'Lin, Zhenhua', 'Piao, Yingshi', 'Jin, Jingchun']","['Li J', 'Zhang Y', 'Cui Y', 'Jin H', 'Lin Z', 'Piao Y', 'Jin J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8529-2510'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210107,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ADR', 'CD44', 'apoptosis', 'drug resistance', 'leukaemia']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/01/07 12:20'],"['2020/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 12:20 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13455 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Oct;43(5):983-989. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13455.

This study compared PCP presentation and outcome according to the underlying disease. A secondary analysis of a previously published prospective observational study including 544 PCP patients was done. Only non-AIDS patients were included. Underlying disease was defined as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), organ transplantation, solid cancer, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT), other hematological diseases, and immunosuppressive treatment. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between groups. Multiple correspondent analyses compared clinical characteristics at diagnosis. Day 30 mortality was analyzed. Three hundred and twenty-one patients were included in the study. The underlying diseases were hematological malignancy (n = 75), AHSCT (n = 14), CLL (n = 19), solid organ transplant (n = 94), solid tumor (n = 39), and immunosuppressive treatment (n = 57). Compared with other underlying diseases, PCP related to CLL was closer to PCP related to AIDS presentation (long duration of symptoms before diagnosis, high level of dyspnea, and low oxygen saturation at diagnosis). Day 30 mortality was associated with underlying disease, oxygen flow, and shock at ICU admission. PCP presentations may vary according to the underlying reason for immunosuppression. Response to treatment and adjuvant steroid therapy should be analyzed regarding this result.","['Burghi, Gaston', 'Biard, Lucie', 'Roux, Antoine', 'Valade, Sandrine', 'Robert-Gangneux, Florence', 'Hamane, Samia', 'Maubon, Daniele', 'Debourgogne, Anne', 'Le Gal, Solene', 'Dalle, Frederic', 'Leterrier, Marion', 'Toubas, Dominique', 'Pomares, Christelle', 'Bellanger, Anne Pauline', 'Bonhomme, Julie', 'Berry, Antoine', 'Iriart, Xavier', 'Durand-Joly, Isabelle', 'Magne, Denis', 'Pons, Denis', 'Hennequin, Christophe', 'Maury, Eric', 'Azoulay, Elie', 'Lemiale, Virginie']","['Burghi G', 'Biard L', 'Roux A', 'Valade S', 'Robert-Gangneux F', 'Hamane S', 'Maubon D', 'Debourgogne A', 'Le Gal S', 'Dalle F', 'Leterrier M', 'Toubas D', 'Pomares C', 'Bellanger AP', 'Bonhomme J', 'Berry A', 'Iriart X', 'Durand-Joly I', 'Magne D', 'Pons D', 'Hennequin C', 'Maury E', 'Azoulay E', 'Lemiale V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20210107,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ICU', 'Immunosuppression', 'Outcome', 'Pneumocystis']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2021/01/07 12:18'],"['2020/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 12:18 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10096-020-04118-w [doi]', '10.1007/s10096-020-04118-w [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2021 Jun;40(6):1191-1198. doi: 10.1007/s10096-020-04118-w.

Here, we describe the first case of ONJ induced by bosutinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who was not taking an antiresorptive agent. A 65-year-old male with no history of either antiresorptive treatment or dental surgery but diagnosed with CML had been undergoing treatment with bosutinib for 2 years. He developed right mandibular stage 2 osteonecrosis. The patient eventually underwent extensive surgery consisting of removal of the necrotic bone and infected soft tissue in combination with nasolabial flap reconstruction. He obtained complete resolution of MRONJ at 12 months postoperatively. As new cancer therapies become available, it is important that clinicians are aware of this novel case of bosutinib-induced ONJ in a patient undergoing CML treatment.","['Myoken, Yoshinari', 'Fujita, Yoshinori', 'Imanaka, Ryota', 'Toratani, Shigeaki']","['Myoken Y', 'Fujita Y', 'Imanaka R', 'Toratani S']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210107,Germany,Oral Maxillofac Surg,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,101319632,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Local flaps', 'Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/08/12 06:00,['2021/01/07 12:16'],"['2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 12:16 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10006-020-00931-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10006-020-00931-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2021 Sep;25(3):421-425. doi: 10.1007/s10006-020-00931-x.

However, identifying patients with very-low-risk (VLR) ALL remains imprecise. Patients selected based on a combination of presenting features and a minimal residual disease (MRD) level <0.01% on day 19 of induction therapy had excellent outcomes with low-intensity treatment. We investigated the impact of MRD levels between 0.001% and <0.01% early in remission induction on the outcome of VLR ALL treated with a low-intensity regimen. Between October of 2011 and September of 2015, 200 consecutive patients with B-precursor ALL with favorable clinicopathologic features and MRD levels <0.01%, as assessed by flow cytometry in the bone marrow on day 19 and at the end of induction therapy, received reduced-intensity therapy. The 5-year event-free survival was 89.5% (+/- 2.2% standard error [SE]), and the overall survival was 95.5% (+/- 1.5% SE). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 7% (95% confidence interval, 4-11%). MRD levels were between 0.001% and <0.01% on day 19 in 29 patients. These patients had a 5-year CIR that was significantly higher than that of patients with undetectable residual leukemia (17.2% +/- 7.2% vs 5.3% +/- 1.7%, respectively; P = .02). Our study shows that children with VLR ALL can be treated successfully with decreased-intensity therapy, and it suggests that the classification criteria for VLR can be further refined by using a more sensitive MRD assay.","['Sidhom, Iman', 'Shaaban, Khaled', 'Youssef, Sarah H', 'Ali, Nesreen', 'Gohar, Seham', 'Rashed, Wafaa M', 'Mehanna, Mai', 'Salem, Sherine', 'Soliman, Sonya', 'Yassin, Dina', 'Mansour, Emad', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rivera, Gaston K']","['Sidhom I', 'Shaaban K', 'Youssef SH', 'Ali N', 'Gohar S', 'Rashed WM', 'Mehanna M', 'Salem S', 'Soliman S', 'Yassin D', 'Mansour E', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rivera GK']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/04/17 06:00,['2021/01/07 12:15'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 12:15 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)86000-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020007977 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jan 7;137(1):20-28. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020007977.,20210416,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", 'Deparment of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Singapore, Singapore; and.', 'Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Department of Oncology, and.', ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Department of Oncology, and.', ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Remission Induction/methods']",,,['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8215189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study reports the use of in silico, in vivo, and in vitro methods to investigate the metabolism and possible metabolic bioactivation of TND. First, in silico metabolism of TND was assessed using the WhichP450 module of the StarDrop(R) software to determine labile sites of metabolism in the TND chemical structure. Second, the XenoSite reactivity model, a web-based metabolism prediction software, was used to determine probable bioactive centers. Based on the in silico outcomes, a list of predicted metabolites and reactive intermediates were prepared. Third, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed. In vitro TND metabolites were generated through incubation of TND with rat liver microsomes (RLMs). Another incubation of TND with RLMs was separately performed in the presence of GSH and KCN to check for the generation of reactive intermediates (soft and hard electrophiles). In vitro phase II metabolism was assessed by incubation of TND with isolated perfused rat hepatocytes. In vivo metabolism was investigated by oral gavage of TND (37 mg kg-1) in Sprague Dawley rats. Five in vitro phase I metabolites, one in vitro phase II and five reactive iminium intermediates (cyano adducts), six in vivo phase I, and one in vivo phase II metabolites of TND were characterized. The in vitro and in vivo metabolic pathways involved were O-dealkylation, alpha-hydroxylation, alpha-carbonyl formation, reduction, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugation. No GSH conjugate or its catabolic products were detected either in vitro or in vivo. Two cyclic tertiary rings of TND (piperazine and piperidine) were metabolically bioactivated to generate reactive iminium intermediates forming cyano adducts with KCN. The formed reactive intermediates may be the reason behind TND toxicity. In silico toxicological studies were performed for TND and its related (in vitro and in vivo) metabolites were evaluated using the DEREK software tool.","['Al-Shakliah, Nasser S', 'Attwa, Mohamed W', 'AlRabiah, Haitham', 'Kadi, Adnan A']","['Al-Shakliah NS', 'Attwa MW', 'AlRabiah H', 'Kadi AA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anal Methods,Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,101519733,IM,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/01/07 12:15'],"['2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 12:15 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0ay02106g [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Methods. 2021 Jan 28;13(3):399-410. doi: 10.1039/d0ay02106g.,20210514,,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, P.O.

One of the most common mutations that results in AML occurs in the gene encoding fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Previous studies have demonstrated that AML cells expressing FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) are more sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Bz) than FLT3 wild-type cells, with this cytotoxicity being mediated by autophagy (Atg). Here, we show that proteasome inhibition with Bz results in modest but consistent proteaphagy in MOLM-14 leukemic cells expressing the FLT3-ITD mutation, but not in OCI-AML3 leukemic cells with wild-type FLT3. Chemical inhibition of Atg with bafilomycin A simultaneously blocked proteaphagy and resulted in the accumulation of the p62 Atg receptor in Bz-treated MOLM-14 cells. The use of ubiquitin traps revealed that ubiquitin plays an important role in proteasome-Atg cross-talk. The p62 inhibitor verteporfin blocked proteaphagy and, importantly, resulted in accumulation of high molecular weight forms of p62 and FLT3-ITD in Bz-treated MOLM-14 cells. Both Atg inhibitors enhanced Bz-induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-driven leukemic cells, highlighting the therapeutic potential of these treatments.","['Lopez-Reyes, Rosa G', 'Quinet, Gregoire', 'Gonzalez-Santamarta, Maria', 'Larrue, Clement', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Rodriguez, Manuel S']","['Lopez-Reyes RG', 'Quinet G', 'Gonzalez-Santamarta M', 'Larrue C', 'Sarry JE', 'Rodriguez MS']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5445-4495'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201124,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3-ITD', '*bortezomib', '*leukaemia', '*proteaphagy', '*ubiquitin']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/07 08:41'],"['2020/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 08:41 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/2211-5463.12950 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2021 Jan;11(1):48-60. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.12950.

PURPOSE: The present study investigated whether objectively measured sleep efficiency and sedentary behavior are related to greater reports of fatigue. METHODS: Eighty-two allogeneic HCT recipients who were 1-5 years post-transplant and returning for a follow-up visit participated (age M = 56, 52% female, 56% leukemia). They wore an actigraph assessing sleep efficiency and sedentary behavior for one week and completed an electronic log assessing fatigue each evening during the same period. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of patients reported clinically meaningful fatigue. On average, fatigue was mild (M = 2.5 on 0-10 scale, SD = 2.0), sleep was disturbed (sleep efficiency M = 78.9%, SD = 8.9), and patients spent the majority of time in sedentary (M = 55.4%, SD = 10.2) or light (M = 35.9%, SD = 8.6) activity. Multilevel model analysis of between-person differences indicated that patients who experienced less efficient sleep the previous evening provided greater evening reports of average fatigue, b = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.11, -0.01). Similarly, within-person analyses indicated that when patients experienced less efficient sleep the previous evening or were more sedentary as compared to their average, they provided greater evening reports of average fatigue, b = -0.02, 95% CI (-0.05, -0.004); b = 4.46, 95% CI (1.95, 6.97), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that poor sleep and daily sedentary behavior are related to evening reports of fatigue and should be considered modifiable targets for intervention.","['Nelson, Ashley M', 'Hyland, Kelly A', 'Small, Brent', 'Kennedy, Brittany', 'Mishra, Asmita', 'Hoogland, Aasha I', 'Bulls, Hailey W', 'Jim, Heather S L', 'Jacobsen, Paul B']","['Nelson AM', 'Hyland KA', 'Small B', 'Kennedy B', 'Mishra A', 'Hoogland AI', 'Bulls HW', 'Jim HSL', 'Jacobsen PB']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1742-3280', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7444-4689']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Ann Behav Med,Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,8510246,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Actigraphy', '*Fatigue', '*Hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Psycho-oncology', '*Sedentary behavior', '*Sleep']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/07 08:39'],"['2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 08:39 [entrez]']","['6067294 [pii]', '10.1093/abm/kaaa110 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Behav Med. 2021 Aug 23;55(9):870-878. doi: 10.1093/abm/kaaa110.,20211210,"['(c) Society of Behavioral Medicine 2021.

In this article, we review improvements in risk stratification which have coincided with this progress, including individual biomarkers and their incorporation into prognostic models. Amidst an ever-expanding list of biomarkers, we seek to bring focus to the essential tests to improve patient care and counseling at particular times in the disease course, beginning with prognosis at diagnosis. The majority of patients do not require treatment at the time of diagnosis, making time-to-first-treatment a key initial prognostic concern. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers are then considered at subsequent major junctures, including at the time of treatment initiation, while on therapy, and at the time of relapse on novel agents.","['Hampel, Paul J', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Call, Timothy G']","['Hampel PJ', 'Parikh SA', 'Call TG']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1292-3024', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3221-7314']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210107,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*biomarker', '*prediction', '*prognosis', '*therapy']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2021/01/07 08:38'],"['2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 08:38 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1869966 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Jun;62(6):1289-1301. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1869966.

A recent clinical study of the dendritic cell vaccine pulsed with Tax peptides corresponding to CTL epitopes showed promising outcomes in ATL patients possessing limited human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. In this study, we aimed to develop another immunotherapy to activate Tax-specific CTL without HLA limitation by using patients' own HTLV-1-infected cells as a vaccine. To examine the potential of HTLV-1-infected T-cells to activate CTL via antigen presenting cells, we established a unique co-culture system. We demonstrated that mitomycin C-treated HLA-A2-negative HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines or short-term cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from ATL patients induced cross-presentation of Tax antigen in co-cultured HLA-A2-positive antigen presenting cells, resulting in activation of HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+) Tax-specific CTL. This effect was not inhibited by a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. IL-12 production and CD86 expression were also induced in antigen presenting cells co-cultured with HTLV-1-infected cells at various levels, which were improved by pre-treatment of the infected cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Furthermore, monocyte-derived dendritic cells induced from PBMC of a chronic ATL patient produced IL-12 and expressed enhanced levels of CD86 when co-cultured with autologous lymphocytes that had been isolated from the same PBMC and cultured for several days. These findings suggest that short-term cultured autologous PBMC from ATL patients could potentially serve as a vaccine to evoke Tax-specific CTL responses.","['Ishizawa, Miku', 'Ganbaatar, Undrakh', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Takatsuka, Natsuko', 'Kondo, Nobuyo', 'Yoneda, Takeru', 'Katagiri, Kuniko', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Ishizawa M', 'Ganbaatar U', 'Hasegawa A', 'Takatsuka N', 'Kondo N', 'Yoneda T', 'Katagiri K', 'Masuda T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Kannagi M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2974-990X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3433-2658']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210205,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'CTL', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax', 'tumor vaccine']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2021/01/07 06:16'],"['2020/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 06:16 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14800 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Mar;112(3):1161-1172. doi: 10.1111/cas.14800.

Additionally, T-cell leukemias and lymphomas can commonly metastasize to the CNS, where outcomes are poor and treatment options are associated with severe side effects. Consequently, the development of safer and more effective alternatives for targeting malignant T cells that have invaded the CNS remains clinically important. CD5 CAR has previously been shown to effectively target various T-cell cancers in preclinical studies. As IL-15 strengthens the anti-tumor response, we have modified CD5 CAR to secrete an IL-15/IL-15sushi complex. In a Phase I clinical trial, these CD5-IL15/IL15sushi CAR T cells were tested for safety and efficacy in a patient with refractory T-LBL with CNS infiltration. CD5-IL15/IL15sushi CAR T cells were able to rapidly ablate the CNS lymphoblasts within a few weeks, resulting in the remission of the patient's lymphoma. Despite the presence of CD5 on normal T cells, the patient only experienced a brief, transient T-cell aplasia. These results suggest that CD5-IL15/IL15sushi CAR T cells may be a safe and useful treatment of T-cell malignancies and may be particularly beneficial for patients with CNS involvement.Graphical Abstract.","['Feng, Jia', 'Xu, Haichan', 'Cinquina, Andrew', 'Wu, Zehua', 'Chen, Qi', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Wang, Xingen', 'Shan, Huiming', 'Xu, Lei', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Sun, Lihua', 'Zhang, Wenli', 'Pinz, Kevin G', 'Wada, Masayuki', 'Jiang, Xun', 'Hanes, William M', 'Ma, Yupo', 'Zhang, Hongyu']","['Feng J', 'Xu H', 'Cinquina A', 'Wu Z', 'Chen Q', 'Zhang P', 'Wang X', 'Shan H', 'Xu L', 'Zhang Q', 'Sun L', 'Zhang W', 'Pinz KG', 'Wada M', 'Jiang X', 'Hanes WM', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang H']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9968-2360', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9202-0310', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7088-9982', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3759-5816', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7784-4645', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9774-5521', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4900-7003', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3473-964X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3984-1117', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5721-0522', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8304-0638', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2635-204X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0858-8681']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD5 CAR and IL15/IL15sushi', '*Hematopoietic cells', '*T cell lymphoma']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2021/01/07 06:14'],"['2020/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 06:14 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12015-020-10092-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12015-020-10092-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2021 Apr;17(2):652-661. doi: 10.1007/s12015-020-10092-9.

However, clinical observations found that some discharged leukemia patients in mainland China had not complied with the requirement of regular care. Our study aims to explore the facilitators and hindrances of regular cares of PICC in leukemia patients with the Colaizzi phenomenon analysis. METHODS: This qualitative report used the descriptive phenomenological method to collect information and was conducted in accordance with the COREQ checklist. By purposive sampling, 11 leukemia patients with PICC were selected and interviewed in the Department of Hematology of a first-class hospital in Wuhan (central China). The interviews were conducted from March 2016 to May 2017. RESULTS: Two facilitators for PICC care were extracted through interviews, including fear of nosocomial infection and convenience for treatment. Eleven hindrances were summarized, including high costs, unavailability of local services, worries about affecting family members, a lack of health awareness, inconvenient transportations, fluke minds, physical discomfort, fears of leukemia and chemotherapy, short chemotherapy intervals, damage to appearance, and no insurance coverage of costs. CONCLUSION: Leukemia patients' compliance with PICC care was hindered by several factors. The improvement of PICC care may need joint efforts of patients, nursing professionals, hospitals' managerial staff, and governments.","['Ai, Ya-Ting', 'Hu, Hui', 'Yang, Chong-Ming', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Yang, Xiao-Ying', 'Ren, Hai-Rong', 'Huang, Yi-Yan']","['Ai YT', 'Hu H', 'Yang CM', 'Zhou X', 'Yang XY', 'Ren HR', 'Huang YY']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7342-9321', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6334-7904']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210107,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult nursing', 'Chemotherapy', 'Health education', 'Health risks', 'Qualitative study']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2021/01/07 06:11'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 06:11 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-020-05941-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-020-05941-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2021 Aug;29(8):4339-4347. doi: 10.1007/s00520-020-05941-9.

We evaluated the risk of developing haematological malignancies and subsequent mortality in individuals with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a population-based observational study using healthcare databases from Ontario, Canada. All Ontario residents 30 years of age or older free of cancer and diabetes between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2015 were eligible for inclusion. Using Cox regression analyses, we explored the association between diabetes and the risk and mortality of haematological malignancies (leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma). The impact of timing on associations was evaluated with analyses stratified by time since diabetes diagnosis (<3 months, 3 months to 1 year, >/=1 year). RESULTS: We identified 1,003,276 individuals with diabetes and age and sex matched these to 2,006,552 individuals without diabetes. Compared with individuals without diabetes, those with diabetes had a modest but significantly higher risk of a haematological malignancy (adjusted HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.08, 1.12] p < 0.0001). This association persisted across all time periods since diabetes diagnosis. Among those with haematological malignancies, diabetes was associated with a higher all-cause mortality (HR 1.36 [95% CI 1.31, 1.41] p < 0.0001) compared with no diabetes, as well as cause-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of haematological malignancies and is an independent risk factor of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Greater efforts for lifestyle modification may not only reduce diabetes burden and its complications but may also potentially lower risk of malignancy and mortality.

Clinical investigations show that chronic stress is commonly present in the course of AML and associated with adverse outcome. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are elusive. In the present study, a chronic restraint stress mouse model was established to evaluate the effect of stress on AML. We found that mice under chronic stress exhibited significantly increased liver and spleen infiltration of leukemic cells and poorer overall survival. This was accompanied by elevated cellular NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in the liver or bone marrow, and secreted IL-1beta in the plasma, indicating the activation of inflammasomes under chronic restraint stress. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression was markedly increased in newly diagnosed AML patients, but reduced in complete remission AML patients. The expression level of HMGB1 was positively correlated with NLRP3 mRNA in AML patients. Knockdown of HMGB1 significantly decreased NLRP3 and IL-1beta expression in AML cell lines, and secreted IL-1beta in supernatant of AML cell culture, while HMGB1 stimulation caused contrary effects. These results implied that HMGB1 could be involved in the regulation of inflammasome activation in AML development. Mice model showed that chronic restraint stress-facilitated proliferation and infiltration of AML cells were largely abrogated by knocking down HMGB1. Knockdown of HMGB1 also ameliorated overall survival and remarkably neutralized NLRP3 and IL-1beta expression under chronic restraint stress. These findings provide evidences that chronic stress promotes AML progression via HMGB1/NLRP3/IL-1beta dependent mechanism, suggesting that HMGB1 is a potential therapeutic target for AML. KEY MESSAGES: * Chronic restraint stress promoted acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression and mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in xenograft mice. * HMGB1 mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in AML cells. * Knockdown of HMGB1 inhibited AML progression under chronic stress in vivo.","['Liu, Na', 'Wu, Yifan', 'Wen, Xin', 'Li, Peng', 'Lu, Fei', 'Shang, Hong']","['Liu N', 'Wu Y', 'Wen X', 'Li P', 'Lu F', 'Shang H']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3666-1727'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210107,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*HMGB1', '*IL-1beta', '*NLRP3', '*Stress']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/07 06:10'],"['2020/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 06:10 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00109-020-02011-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00109-020-02011-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2021 Mar;99(3):403-414. doi: 10.1007/s00109-020-02011-9.

Imatinib and GNF-5 are breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia tyrosine kinase inhibitors which have been approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and various solid tumors. However, the effect and underlying mechanisms of imatinib and GNF-5 in HCC remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity and underlying mechanisms of imatinib and GNF-5 in HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells. Cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation assays were done to evaluate the effects of imatinib and GNF-5 on the growth of HepG2 cells. The cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry and verified by immunoblot analysis. Gene overexpression and knockdown assays were conducted to evaluate the function of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2). Imatinib and GNF-5 significantly inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells. Imatinib and GNF-5 induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest by downregulating Skp2 and upregulating p27 and p21. Overexpression of Skp2 reduced the effect of imatinib and GNF-5 on HepG2 cells. Knockdown of Skp2 suppressed the proliferation and induced G0/G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, knockdown of Skp2 enhanced the effect of imatinib and GNF-5 on growth of HepG2 cells. In conclusion, imatinib and GNF-5 effectively suppress HepG2 cell growth by inhibiting Skp2 expression. Skp2 promotes the cell proliferation and reverse G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and it represents a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.","['Zhang, Haibo', 'Yi, Junkoo', 'Yoon, Duhak', 'Ryoo, Zaeyoung', 'Lee, Inkyu', 'Kim, Myoungok']","['Zhang H', 'Yi J', 'Yoon D', 'Ryoo Z', 'Lee I', 'Kim M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3082-8012', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2593-6529', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3983-9757', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6993-3624', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2261-7269', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6650-7734']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),J Cancer Prev,Journal of cancer prevention,101615965,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell cycle', 'GNF-5', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Imatinib', 'S-phase kinase-associated protein 2']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:01,['2021/01/07 06:08'],"['2020/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.15430/JCP.2020.25.4.252 [doi]', 'JCP-25-252 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Prev. 2020 Dec 30;25(4):252-257. doi: 10.15430/JCP.2020.25.4.252.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Korean Society of Cancer Prevention.'],"['Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Korea.', 'Gyeongsangbukdo Livestock Institute Research, Yeongju, Korea.', 'Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Korea.', 'School of Life Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Korea.']",,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.'],,,PMC7783238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematological malignancies, there is a strong relationship between cellular metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, interconnections with supportive microenvironment and drug resistance. Lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, e.g., adapt to intrinsic oxidative stress by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis. In other hematological disorders such as myeloma, on the contrary, bioenergetics changes, associated to increased mitochondrial fitness, derive from the adaptive response to drug-induced stress. In the bone marrow niche, a reverse Warburg effect has been recently described, consisting in metabolic changes occurring in stromal cells in the attempt to metabolically support adjacent cancer cells. Moreover, a physiological dynamic, based on mitochondria transfer, between tumor cells and their supporting stromal microenvironment has been described to sustain oxidative stress associated to proteostasis maintenance in multiple myeloma and leukemia. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis of tumor cells associated to acquisition of new mitochondria transferred by mesenchymal stromal cells results in augmented ATP production through increased oxidative phosphorylation (OX-PHOS), higher drug resistance, and resurgence after treatment. Accordingly, targeting mitochondrial biogenesis, electron transfer, mitochondrial DNA replication, or mitochondrial fatty acid transport increases therapy efficacy. In this review, we summarize selected examples of the mitochondrial derangements in hematological malignancies, which provide metabolic adaptation and apoptosis resistance, also supported by the crosstalk with tumor microenvironment. This field promises a rational design to improve target-therapy including the metabolic phenotype.","['Barbato, Alessandro', 'Scandura, Grazia', 'Puglisi, Fabrizio', 'Cambria, Daniela', 'La Spina, Enrico', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe Alberto', 'Lazzarino, Giacomo', 'Tibullo, Daniele', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Giallongo, Cesarina', 'Romano, Alessandra']","['Barbato A', 'Scandura G', 'Puglisi F', 'Cambria D', 'La Spina E', 'Palumbo GA', 'Lazzarino G', 'Tibullo D', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Giallongo C', 'Romano A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201221,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['OX-PHOS', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic lymphatic leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'mitochondria', 'multiple myeloma']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:01,['2021/01/07 06:08'],"['2020/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.604143 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 21;10:604143. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.604143. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Barbato, Scandura, Puglisi, Cambria, La Spina, Palumbo,', 'Lazzarino, Tibullo, Di Raimondo, Giallongo and Romano.']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of General Surgery and Medical-Surgical Specialties, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of General Surgery and Medical-Surgical Specialties, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical Sciences and Advanced Technologies G.F.

The goal of this study was to investigate if there was a significant difference in the five-year survival between Black and White children with ALL, specifically up to the year 2016 which has not been researched. Methods A retrospective cohort study of Black and White children diagnosed with ALL between 1975 and 2016 was carried out using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database. Children aged 0-19 were separated into Black or White, and then survival analysis was used to compare five-year survival. A multivariate cox regression analysis was carried out to determine the association between race and five-year survival with ALL. Results Our sample included 17,663 cases consisting of 16,238 White children and 1,425 Black children. White children had a significantly increased five-year mortality survival when compared to Black children. Upon using multivariate cox regression analysis, both unadjusted and adjusted models showed a significantly higher risk of death in Black children when compared to White children. Conclusions Our study found that there is a significant difference in the five-year survival between Black and White children diagnosed with ALL. The difference in survival persists even when controlling for sex, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and histology. Future studies should be carried out to control for more confounders that the SEER database is unable to control for.","['Bryant, Courtney', 'Mayhew, Mackenzie', 'Fleites, Jorge', 'Lozano, Juan', 'Saunders, John M']","['Bryant C', 'Mayhew M', 'Fleites J', 'Lozano J', 'Saunders JM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201130,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all)', 'cancer', 'race', 'survival']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:01,['2021/01/07 06:07'],"['2021/01/07 06:07 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.11797 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Nov 30;12(11):e11797. doi: 10.7759/cureus.11797.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Bryant et al.']","['Pediatric Oncology, Florida International University, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Florida International University, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Florida International University, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.', 'Translational Medicine, Florida International University, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.', 'Pediatric Medicine, Florida International University, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, USA.']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC7779168,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We used a genetic mouse model of Notch ligand delta like 4 (DLL4)-driven T-ALL and performed thymectomies and splenectomies in those animals. We also used several patient-derived T-ALL (PDTALL) models, including one with DLL4 expression on the membrane and we treated PDTALL cells in vitro and in vivo with demcizumab, a blocking antibody against human DLL4 currently being tested in clinical trials in patients with solid cancer. Results: We show that surgical removal of the spleen abrogated T-ALL development in our preclinical DLL4-driven T-ALL mouse model. Mechanistically, we found that the spleen, and not the thymus, promoted the accumulation of circulating CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells before T-ALL onset, suggesting that DLL4-driven T-ALL derives from these cells. Then, we identified a small subset of T-ALL patients showing higher levels of DLL4 expression. Moreover, in mice xenografted with a DLL4-positive PDTALL model, treatment with demcizumab had the same therapeutic effect as global Notch pathway inhibition using the potent gamma-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine. This result demonstrates that, in this PDTALL model, Notch pathway activity depends on DLL4 signaling, thus validating our preclinical mouse model. Conclusion: DLL4 expression in human leukemic cells can be a source of Notch activity in T-ALL, and the spleen plays a major role in a genetic mouse model of DLL4-driven T-ALL.","['Xiong, Huizhong', 'Mancini, Maicol', 'Gobert, Michael', 'Shen, Shiqian', 'Furtado, Glaucia C', 'Lira, Sergio A', 'Parkhurst, Christopher N', 'Garambois, Veronique', 'Brengues, Muriel', 'Tadokoro, Carlos E', 'Trimarchi, Thomas', 'Gomez-Lopez, Gonzalo', 'Singh, Amartya', 'Khiabanian, Hossein', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Lobry, Camille', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'Herranz, Daniel', 'Lafaille, Juan J', 'Maraver, Antonio']","['Xiong H', 'Mancini M', 'Gobert M', 'Shen S', 'Furtado GC', 'Lira SA', 'Parkhurst CN', 'Garambois V', 'Brengues M', 'Tadokoro CE', 'Trimarchi T', 'Gomez-Lopez G', 'Singh A', 'Khiabanian H', 'Minuzzo S', 'Indraccolo S', 'Lobry C', 'Aifantis I', 'Herranz D', 'Lafaille JJ', 'Maraver A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210101,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*DLL4', '*Notch pathway', '*T-ALL', '*demcizumab', '*patient-derived xenografts']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/01/07 06:06'],"['2020/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:06 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.48067 [doi]', 'thnov11p1594 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2021 Jan 1;11(4):1594-1608. doi: 10.7150/thno.48067. eCollection 2021.,20210816,['(c) The author(s).'],"['Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'The Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Current address: Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, 94080.', 'Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier (IRCM), Universite de Montpellier, Institut Regional du Cancer de Montpellier (ICM), Montpellier, 34298, Cedex 5, France.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Current address: Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', 'Immunology Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Immunology Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier (IRCM), Universite de Montpellier, Institut Regional du Cancer de Montpellier (ICM), Montpellier, 34298, Cedex 5, France.', 'Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier (IRCM), Universite de Montpellier, Institut Regional du Cancer de Montpellier (ICM), Montpellier, 34298, Cedex 5, France.', 'Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Current address: Universidade Vila Velha, Vila Velha, 29102-920, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Bioinformatics unit.

To define the underlying regulatory dynamics, we analyzed time courses of leukemia burden and immune abundance of haplo-SCT or MSDT from multiple dimension. First, we employed two nonirradiated leukemia mouse models which carried human AML-ETO or MLL-AF9 fusion gene to establish haplo-identical and major histocompatibility (MHC)-matched transplantation models and investigated the immune cell dynamic response during leukemia development in vivo. We found that haplo-matching the MHCs of leukemia cells with recipient mouse T cells prolonged leukemic mice survival and reduced leukemia burden. The stronger graft-versus-leukemia activity in haplo-SCT group mainly induced by decreased apoptosis and increased cytotoxic cytokine secretion including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, pore-forming proteins and CD107a secreted by T cells or natural killer cells. Furthermore, we conducted a prospective clinical trial which enrolled 135 patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia that displayed minimal residual disease before transplantation and underwent either haplo-SCT or MSDT. The results showed that the haplo-SCT slowed the kinetics of the leukemia burden in vivo and reduced the cumulative incidence of relapse compared with MSDT. Ex vivo experiments showed that, 1 year after transplantation, cytotoxic T lymphocytes from the haplo-SCT group had higher cytotoxicity than those from the MSDT group during the same period. Our results unraveled the role of immune cells in superior antileukemia effects of haplo-SCT compared with MSDT.","['Guo, Huidong', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Hong, Yan', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Wang, Ming', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Wei-Han', 'Sun, Yu-Qian', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Tang, Fei-Fei', 'Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Guo H', 'Chang YJ', 'Hong Y', 'Xu LP', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang XH', 'Wang M', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Wang FR', 'Wei-Han', 'Sun YQ', 'Yan CH', 'Tang FF', 'Mo XD', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Graft-versus-leukemia', '*Haplo-SCT', '*MRD', '*MSDT']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2021/01/07 06:02'],"['2020/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/05/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 06:02 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41423-020-00597-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41423-020-00597-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2021 May;18(5):1172-1185. doi: 10.1038/s41423-020-00597-1.

However, our understanding of leukemogenesis was limited due to the high individual differences. Integrated analyses of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis potentially provides new insights. Here we analyzed ~200,000 single-cell transcriptomes of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) and its subsets from 23 clinical samples. We constructed a comprehensive cell atlas as hematopoietic reference. We developed counterpart composite index (CCI; available at GitHub: https://github.com/pengfeeei/cci) to search for the healthy counterpart of each leukemia cell subpopulation, by integrating multiple statistics to map leukemia cells onto reference hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, we found leukemia cell subpopulations from each patient had different healthy counterparts. Analysis showed the trajectories of leukemia cell subpopulations were similar to that of their healthy counterparts, indicating that developmental termination of leukemia initiating cells at different phases leads to different leukemia cell subpopulations thus explained the origin of leukemia heterogeneity. CCI further predicts leukemia subtypes, cellular heterogeneity, and cellular stemness of each leukemia patient. Analyses of leukemia patient at diagnosis, refractory, remission and relapse vividly presented dynamics of cell population during leukemia treatment. CCI analyses showed the healthy counterparts of relapsed leukemia cells were closer to the root of hematopoietic tree than that of other leukemia cells, although single-cell transcriptomic genetic variants and haplotype tracing analyses showed the relapsed leukemia cell were derived from an early minor leukemia cell population. In summary, this study developed a unified framework for understanding leukemogenesis with hematopoiesis reference, which provided novel biological and medical implication.","['Qin, Pengfei', 'Pang, Yakun', 'Hou, Wenhong', 'Fu, Ruiqing', 'Zhang, Yingchi', 'Wang, Xuefei', 'Meng, Guofeng', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Zhu, Xiaofan', 'Hong, Ni', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Jin, Wenfei']","['Qin P', 'Pang Y', 'Hou W', 'Fu R', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X', 'Meng G', 'Liu Q', 'Zhu X', 'Hong N', 'Cheng T', 'Jin W']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1795-9838', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4395-1095', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0028-3739']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210105,England,Cell Discov,Cell discovery,101661034,,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:01,['2021/01/07 06:01'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41421-020-00223-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41421-020-00223-4 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Discov. 2021 Jan 5;7(1):2. doi: 10.1038/s41421-020-00223-4.,,,"['Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology & National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine & Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology & National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine & Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', 'Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Biomedical Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology & National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine & Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. hongn@mail.sustech.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology & National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China. chengtao@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine & Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China. chengtao@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. jinwf@sustech.edu.cn.']",,,,,"['JCYJ20170817111841427/Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission', '81872330/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)']",PMC7788081,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This case control study was conducted between July, 2013 and June, 2014 at a tertiary care cancer centre in India. Study participants included 65 survivors of childhood ALL who were <18 years of age at diagnosis, treated between years 1996 and 2008, and were at least two years since completion of therapy. The controls included 50 matched siblings. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to study the body composition (body fat percentage, BF% and lean body mass, LBM) of the participants and controls. McCarthy's body fat reference data were applied and logistic regression analysis was used to study various risk factors. RESULTS: At a median (range) follow-up of 5 (7.2-17.2) years, BF% (DEXA) identified a significantly higher prevalence of obesity of 21.5% (14/65) and sarcopenic obesity (14%) among survivors as compared to the controls (0/50, P<0.001), while the prevalence of sarcopenia as detected by LBM was similar at 60% (39/65) and 56% (28/50), respectively. On multivariate analysis, age at evaluation, high-risk disease and cranial irradiation were independently associated with high likelihood of obesity, while none of the factors predicted sarcopenia.

Unfortunately, these treatments have produced limited results in various types of leukemia because of an insufficient GVT effect. In this context, molecular engineering of donor lymphocytes to increase the GVT effect may benefit cancer patients. Activating MyD88 signaling in CD8(+) T cells via TLR enhances T cell activation and cytotoxicity. However, systemic administration of TLR ligands to stimulate MyD88 could induce hyperinflammation or elicit protumor effects. To circumvent this problem, we devised a synthetic molecule consisting of MyD88 linked to the ectopic domain of CD8a (CD8alpha:MyD88). We used this construct to test the hypothesis that MyD88 costimulation in donor CD8(+) T cells increases tumor control following allo-HCT in mice by increasing T cell activation, function, and direct tumor cytotoxicity. Indeed, an increase in both in vitro and in vivo tumor control was observed with CD8alpha:MyD88 T cells. This increase in the GVT response was associated with increased T cell expansion, increased functional capacity, and an increase in direct cytotoxic killing of the tumor cells. However, MyD88 costimulation in donor CD8(+) T cells was linked to increased yet nonlethal graft-versus-host disease in mice treated with these engineered CD8(+) T cells. Given these observations, synthetic CD8alpha:MyD88 donor T cells may represent a unique and versatile approach to enhance the GVT response that merits further refinement to improve the effectiveness of allo-HCT.","['Ciavattone, Nicholas G', 'Wu, Long', ""O'Neill, Rachel"", 'Qiu, Jingxin', 'Davila, Eduardo', 'Cao, Xuefang']","['Ciavattone NG', 'Wu L', ""O'Neill R"", 'Qiu J', 'Davila E', 'Cao X']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9265-8202', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9738-4167']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Comment']",20210106,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2021/01/07 06:00'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.2000479 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.2000479 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2021 Feb 15;206(4):892-903. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2000479.

RESULTS: This was a secondary analysis of a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, which was conducted in seven tertiary care hospitals across Thailand. A total of 81 unfit AML patients were randomized into two treatment groups, metronomic chemotherapy and palliative treatment. The hazard ratio of metronomic chemotherapy over palliative treatment was time-dependent. At three landmark time points of 90, 180, 365 days, the restricted mean survival time differences were 13.3 (95% CI 1.9-24.7) days, 28.9 (95% CI 3.3-54.4) days, and 40.4 (95% CI - 1.3 to 82.0) days, respectively. With non-proportional hazards modeling and RMST analysis, we were able to conclude that metronomic chemotherapy is a potentially effective alternative treatment for elderly AML patients who were medically unfit for intensive chemotherapy. In the future clinical trials, non-proportional hazards should be carefully inspected and properly handled with appropriate statistical methods.

Patients with CMML are frequently treated with epigenetic therapeutic approaches, in particular the hypomethylating agents (HMAs), azacitidine (Aza) and decitabine (Dec). Although HMAs are believed to mediate their efficacy via re-expression of hypermethylated tumor suppressors, knowledge about relevant HMA targets is scarce. As silencing of tumor-suppressive micro-RNAs (miRs) by promoter hypermethylation is a crucial step in malignant transformation, we asked for a role of miRs in HMA efficacy in CMML. RESULTS: Initially, we performed genome-wide miR-expression profiling in a Kras(G12D)-induced CMML mouse model. Selected candidates with prominently decreased expression were validated by qPCR in CMML mice and human CMML patients. These experiments revealed the consistent decrease in miR-125a, a miR with previously described tumor-suppressive function in myeloid neoplasias. Furthermore, we show that miR-125a downregulation is caused by hypermethylation of its upstream region and can be reversed by HMA treatment. By employing both lentiviral and CRISPR/Cas9-based miR-125a modification, we demonstrate that HMA-induced miR-125a upregulation indeed contributes to mediating the anti-leukemic effects of these drugs. These data were validated in a clinical context, as miR-125a expression increased after HMA treatment in CMML patients, a phenomenon that was particularly pronounced in cases showing clinical response to these drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we report decreased expression of miR-125a in CMML and delineate its relevance as mediator of HMA efficacy within this neoplasia.","['Berg, Johannes Lorenz', 'Perfler, Bianca', 'Hatzl, Stefan', 'Mayer, Marie-Christina', 'Wurm, Sonja', 'Uhl, Barbara', 'Reinisch, Andreas', 'Klymiuk, Ingeborg', 'Tierling, Sascha', 'Pregartner, Gudrun', 'Bachmaier, Gerhard', 'Berghold, Andrea', 'Geissler, Klaus', 'Pichler, Martin', 'Hoefler, Gerald', 'Strobl, Herbert', 'Wolfler, Albert', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Zebisch, Armin']","['Berg JL', 'Perfler B', 'Hatzl S', 'Mayer MC', 'Wurm S', 'Uhl B', 'Reinisch A', 'Klymiuk I', 'Tierling S', 'Pregartner G', 'Bachmaier G', 'Berghold A', 'Geissler K', 'Pichler M', 'Hoefler G', 'Strobl H', 'Wolfler A', 'Sill H', 'Zebisch A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4861-7021'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Azacitidine', '*Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*Hypomethylating agent', '*Tumor suppressor', '*miRNA']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/07 05:51'],"['2020/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 05:51 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-020-00979-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-020-00979-2 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2021 Jan 6;13(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s13148-020-00979-2.,20211210,,"['Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Core Facility Molecular Biology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Saarland, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', '5th Medical Department with Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Hospital Hietzing, Vienna, Austria.', 'Sigmund Freud University, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Oncology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Diagnostic and Research Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Otto Loewi Research Centre, Immunology and Pathophysiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036, Graz, Austria. armin.zebisch@medunigraz.at.', 'Otto-Loewi Research Centre for Vascular Biology, Immunology and Inflammation, Division of Pharmacology, Medical University of Graz, Universitatsplatz 4, 8010, Graz, Austria. armin.zebisch@medunigraz.at.']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']","['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', '*RNA, Messenger']",,,,PMC7789782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is observed the clinical course of CLL cases with del(13q) are quite heterogeneous and the responsible for this clinical heterogeneity has not been established yet. Some investigators suggest type II deletion (include RB1 gene) is associated with more aggressive clinical course. Also, it is suggested that the deletion burden and the deletion type have a prognostic effect. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of RB1 gene deletion, deletion burden and deletion type on overall survival (OS), disease stage and time to first treatment (TTFT) in patients with isolated del(3q). Sixty eight cases, detected isolated del(13q) were included in the study. Also, RB1 deletion was analyzed from peripheral blood of them using FISH. RESULTS: RB1 deletion was detected in 41% of patients, but there was no statistically significant difference between RB1 deletion and TTFT, stage and OS (p > 0.05). At same time, statistically significant difference was detected between high del(13q) (> 80%) and TTFT (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The statistical analysis of our data regarding to the association between RB1 deletion and deletion type, TTFT, disease stage, and OS has not confirmed type II deletion or biallelic deletion cause poor prognosis. However, our data supports the deletion burden has a prognostic effect.

Clinical transition has been safely achieved for H(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibitors such as omeprazole and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitors like digoxin. However, this is more challenging for Ca(2+)-ATPase modulators due to the physiological role of Ca(2+) in cardiac dynamics. Over the past two decades, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) modulators have been studied as potential chemotherapy agents because of their Ca(2+)-mediated pan-cancer lethal effects. Instead, recent evidence suggests that SERCA inhibition suppresses oncogenic Notch1 signaling emerging as an alternative to gamma-secretase modulators that showed limited clinical activity due to severe side effects. In this review, we focus on how SERCA inhibitors alter Notch1 signaling and show that Notch on-target-mediated antileukemia properties of these molecules can be achieved without causing overt Ca(2+) cellular overload.","['Pagliaro, Luca', 'Marchesini, Matteo', 'Roti, Giovanni']","['Pagliaro L', 'Marchesini M', 'Roti G']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8664-950X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210106,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAD204520', '*NOTCH1', '*Notch signaling', '*SERCA', '*T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*T-ALL', '*Thapsigargin']",2021/01/08 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2021/01/07 05:49'],"['2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 05:49 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-01015-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-01015-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jan 6;14(1):8. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-01015-9.,20210614,,"['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, 43126, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, 43126, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, 43126, Parma, Italy. giovanni.roti@unipr.it.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thapsigargin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,,PMC7789735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Augmentation of the inflammatory effects of HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes by recruitment of other inflammatory cells in a positive feedback loop is likely to underlie the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 associated pulmonary disease, as has been proposed for HTLV-1 associated myelopathy. In contrast to the conclusions of early case series, HTLV-1 associated pulmonary disease can be associated with significant parenchymal damage, which may progress to bronchiectasis where this involves the airways.

The drug has been shown to act as a potent multikinase inhibitor by blocking not only the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence but also the SRC kinase family, though unexpected adverse events such as pleural effusion have recently been reported in patients undergoing treatment with dasatinib. Hemorrhagic colitis is a unique gastrointestinal adverse events associated with dasatinib and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a case of dasatinib-induced asymptomatic colitis in a patient with CML, who showed no exacerbation in careful observations and maintained deep molecular response (DMR) during a 3-year period. In addition, we performed transcriptome analysis of inflamed colonic mucosa specimens to clarify the possible mechanism of colitis that develops in association with dasatinib administration. Our results demonstrated that differential gene expression, especially lymphocyte-associated genes and chemokines, is substantially involved in inflammation of colonic mucosa in affected patients.

HF, a Model Bacterium to Study Fatal Human Ehrlichiosis.",11,10.1186/s12864-020-07309-z [doi],"BACKGROUND: The genus Ehrlichia consists of tick-borne obligatory intracellular bacteria that can cause deadly diseases of medical and agricultural importance. Ehrlichia sp. HF, isolated from Ixodes ovatus ticks in Japan [also referred to as I. ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE) agent], causes acute fatal infection in laboratory mice that resembles acute fatal human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis. As there is no small laboratory animal model to study fatal human ehrlichiosis, Ehrlichia sp. HF provides a needed disease model. However, the inability to culture Ehrlichia sp. HF and the lack of genomic information have been a barrier to advance this animal model. In addition, Ehrlichia sp. HF has several designations in the literature as it lacks a taxonomically recognized name. RESULTS: We stably cultured Ehrlichia sp. HF in canine histiocytic leukemia DH82 cells from the HF strain-infected mice, and determined its complete genome sequence. Ehrlichia sp. HF has a single double-stranded circular chromosome of 1,148,904 bp, which encodes 866 proteins with a similar metabolic potential as E. chaffeensis. Ehrlichia sp. HF encodes homologs of all virulence factors identified in E. chaffeensis, including 23 paralogs of P28/OMP-1 family outer membrane proteins, type IV secretion system apparatus and effector proteins, two-component systems, ankyrin-repeat proteins, and tandem repeat proteins. Ehrlichia sp. HF is a novel species in the genus Ehrlichia, as demonstrated through whole genome comparisons with six representative Ehrlichia species, subspecies, and strains, using average nucleotide identity, digital DNA-DNA hybridization, and core genome alignment sequence identity. CONCLUSIONS: The genome of Ehrlichia sp. HF encodes all known virulence factors found in E. chaffeensis, substantiating it as a model Ehrlichia species to study fatal human ehrlichiosis. Comparisons between Ehrlichia sp. HF and E. chaffeensis will enable identification of in vivo virulence factors that are related to host specificity, disease severity, and host inflammatory responses. We propose to name Ehrlichia sp. HF as Ehrlichia japonica sp. nov. (type strain HF), to denote the geographic region where this bacterium was initially isolated.","['Lin, Mingqun', 'Xiong, Qingming', 'Chung, Matthew', 'Daugherty, Sean C', 'Nagaraj, Sushma', 'Sengamalay, Naomi', 'Ott, Sandra', 'Godinez, Al', 'Tallon, Luke J', 'Sadzewicz, Lisa', 'Fraser, Claire', 'Dunning Hotopp, Julie C', 'Rikihisa, Yasuko']","['Lin M', 'Xiong Q', 'Chung M', 'Daugherty SC', 'Nagaraj S', 'Sengamalay N', 'Ott S', 'Godinez A', 'Tallon LJ', 'Sadzewicz L', 'Fraser C', 'Dunning Hotopp JC', 'Rikihisa Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9964-5460'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210106,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Comparative genomic analysis', 'Core genome alignment', 'Ehrlichia sp.

APR-246 reactivates the transcriptional activity of p53 mutants by facilitating their binding to DNA target sites. Recent studies in solid cancers have found that APR-246 can also induce p53-independent cell death. In this study, we demonstrate that AML cell death occurring early after APR-246 exposure is suppressed by iron chelators, lipophilic antioxidants and inhibitors of lipid peroxidation, and correlates with the accumulation of markers of lipid peroxidation, thus fulfilling the definition of ferroptosis, a recently described cell death process. The capacity of AML cells to detoxify lipid peroxides by increasing their cystine uptake to maintain major antioxidant molecule glutathione biosynthesis after exposure to APR-246 may be a key determinant of sensitivity to this compound. The association of APR-246 with induction of ferroptosis (either by pharmacological compounds, or genetic inactivation of SLC7A11 or GPX4) had a synergistic effect on the promotion of cell death, both in vivo and ex vivo.","['Birsen, Rudy', 'Larrue, Clement', 'Decroocq, Justine', 'Johnson, Natacha', 'Guiraud, Nathan', 'Gotanegre, Mathilde', 'Cantero-Aguilar, Lilia', 'Grignano, Eric', 'Huynh, Tony', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Sarry, Jean Emmanuel', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Birsen R', 'Larrue C', 'Decroocq J', 'Johnson N', 'Guiraud N', 'Gotanegre M', 'Cantero-Aguilar L', 'Grignano E', 'Huynh T', 'Fontenay M', 'Kosmider O', 'Mayeux P', 'Chapuis N', 'Sarry JE', 'Tamburini J', 'Bouscary D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210107,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2021/01/08 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2021/01/07 03:23'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/07 03:23 [entrez]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.259531 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Jan 7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.259531.,,,"[""Universite de Paris, Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.

In a mouse model, down-regulation of CD26 prevented graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) but preserved graft-versus-tumor effects. Whether inhibition of DPP-4 with sitagliptin may prevent acute GVHD after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is not known. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage, phase 2 clinical trial to test whether sitagliptin plus tacrolimus and sirolimus would reduce the incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD from 30% to no more than 15% by day 100. Patients received myeloablative conditioning followed by mobilized peripheral-blood stem-cell transplants. Sitagliptin was given orally at a dose of 600 mg every 12 hours starting the day before transplantation until day 14 after transplantation. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients who could be evaluated, with a median age of 46 years (range, 20 to 59), received transplants from matched related or unrelated donors. Acute GVHD occurred in 2 of 36 patients by day 100; the incidence of grade II to IV GVHD was 5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 16), and the incidence of grade III or IV GVHD was 3% (95% CI, 0 to 12). Nonrelapse mortality was zero at 1 year. The 1-year cumulative incidences of relapse and chronic GVHD were 26% (95% CI, 13 to 41) and 37% (95% CI, 22 to 53), respectively. GVHD-free, relapse-free survival was 46% (95% CI, 29 to 62) at 1 year. Toxic effects were similar to those seen in patients undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: In this nonrandomized trial, sitagliptin in combination with tacrolimus and sirolimus resulted in a low incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD by day 100 after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

A questionnaire survey was conducted at our facility from October 2012 to January 2018, and the study periods were divided into 4 phases comprising 16 months each. A multiple-choice questionnaire assessed participants' awareness of the following 13 pathogens of mother-to-child infections: cytomegalovirus (CMV), Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), hepatitis B virus, rubella virus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T cell leukemia virus type-1, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Treponema pallidum. For the selected four pathogens (i.e., CMV, rubella virus, T. gondii, and parvovirus B19), the questionnaire also evaluated participants' knowledge of transmission routes, the most susceptible time of infection that could yield severe fetal disease during pregnancy, the maximum frequency of fetal infection in cases of maternal infection, and methods to prevent maternal infection. In total, 1433 pregnant Japanese women were included in this study. There was no secular change in awareness of the pathogens concerning mother-to-child infections over time, and we also clarified that the detailed knowledge of the four pathogens of typical mother-to-child infections did not improve. Since knowledge about methods to prevent maternal infection is still insufficient for all pathogens, further advocacy is required to prevent mother-to-child infections.","['Suga, Shutaro', 'Fujioka, Kazumichi', 'Nakasone, Ruka', 'Abe, Shinya', 'Fukushima, Sachiyo', 'Ashina, Mariko', 'Nishida, Kosuke', 'Nozu, Kandai', 'Iijima, Kazumoto', 'Tanimura, Kenji', 'Yamada, Hideto']","['Suga S', 'Fujioka K', 'Nakasone R', 'Abe S', 'Fukushima S', 'Ashina M', 'Nishida K', 'Nozu K', 'Iijima K', 'Tanimura K', 'Yamada H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9913-6447'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/01/07 06:00,2021/05/12 06:00,['2021/01/06 17:13'],"['2020/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 17:13 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0244945 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-29784 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Jan 6;16(1):e0244945. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0244945. eCollection 2021.,20210511,,"['Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/ethnology', 'Humans', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control', 'Japan', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/ethnology/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC7787470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It exerts various functions through activation of G protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptors (LPARs). In previous studies, we have demonstrated that activation of LPA receptor 3 (LPA3) promotes erythropoiesis of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and zebrafish using molecular and pharmacological approaches. Our results show that treatment with lysophosphatidic acid receptor 2 (LPA2) agonist suppressed erythropoiesis, whereas activation of LPA3 by 1-oleoyl-2-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphothionate (2S-OMPT) promoted it, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the inhibitory role of LPA3 during megakaryopoiesis. However, the mechanism underlying these observations remains elusive. In the present study, we suggest that the expression pattern of LPARs may be correlated with the transcriptional factors GATA-1 and GATA-2 at different stages of myeloid progenitors. We determined that manipulation of GATA factors affected the expression levels of LPA2 and LPA3 in K562 leukemia cells. Using luciferase assays, we demonstrate that the promoter regions of LPAR2 and LPAR3 genes were regulated by these GATA factors in HEK293T cells. Mutation of GATA-binding sites in these regions abrogated luciferase activity, suggesting that LPA2 and LPA3 are regulated by GATA factors. Moreover, physical interaction between GATA factors and the promoter region of LPAR genes was verified in K562 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies. Taken together, our results suggest that balance between LPA2 and LPA3 expression, which may be determined by GATA factors, is a regulatory switch for lineage commitment in myeloid progenitors. The expression-level balance of LPA receptor subtypes represents a novel mechanism regulating erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.","['Lin, Kuan-Hung', 'Chiang, Jui-Chung', 'Chen, Wei-Min', 'Ho, Ya-Hsuan', 'Yao, Chao-Ling', 'Lee, Hsinyu']","['Lin KH', 'Chiang JC', 'Chen WM', 'Ho YH', 'Yao CL', 'Lee H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7196-5833'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

We evaluated the value of minimal residual disease (MRD) in infants with KMT2A-rearranged ALL treated within the Interfant-06 protocol, which compared lymphoid-style consolidation (protocol IB) versus myeloid-style consolidation (araC, daunorubicin, etoposide/mitoxantrone, araC, etoposide). MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRD was measured in 249 infants by DNA-based polymerase chain reaction of rearranged KMT2A, immunoglobulin, and/or T-cell receptor genes, at the end of induction (EOI) and end of consolidation (EOC). MRD results were classified as negative, intermediate (< 5 x 10(-4)), and high (>/= 5 x 10(-4)). RESULTS: EOI MRD levels predicted outcome with 6-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 60.2% (95% CI, 43.2 to 73.6), 45.0% (95% CI, 28.3 to 53.1), and 33.8% (95% CI, 23.8 to 44.1) for infants with negative, intermediate, and high EOI MRD levels, respectively (P = .0039). EOC MRD levels were also predictive of outcome, with 6-year DFS of 68.2% (95% CI, 55.2 to 78.1), 40.1% (95% CI, 28.1 to 51.9), and 11.9% (95% CI, 2.6 to 29.1) for infants with negative, intermediate, and high EOC MRD levels, respectively (P < .0001). Analysis of EOI MRD according to the type of consolidation treatment showed that infants treated with lymphoid-style consolidation had 6-year DFS of 78.2% (95% CI, 51.4 to 91.3), 47.2% (95% CI, 33.0 to 60.1), and 23.2% (95% CI, 12.1 to 36.4) for negative, intermediate, and high MRD levels, respectively (P < .0001), while for myeloid-style-treated patients the corresponding figures were 45.0% (95% CI, 23.9 to 64.1), 41.3% (95% CI, 23.2 to 58.5), and 45.9% (95% CI, 29.4 to 60.9). CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the idea that induction therapy selects patients for subsequent therapy; infants with high EOI MRD may benefit from AML-like consolidation (DFS 45.9% v 23.2%), whereas patients with low EOI MRD may benefit from ALL-like consolidation (DFS 78.2% v 45.0%). Patients with positive EOC MRD had dismal outcomes. These findings will be used for treatment interventions in the next Interfant protocol.","['Stutterheim, Janine', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'de Lorenzo, Paola', 'Alten, Julia', 'Ancliffe, Philip', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Brethon, Benoit', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Campbell, Myriam', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Kotecha, Rishi S', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Li, Chi Kong', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stary, Jan', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Zuna, Jan', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Stutterheim J', 'van der Sluis IM', 'de Lorenzo P', 'Alten J', 'Ancliffe P', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Brethon B', 'Biondi A', 'Campbell M', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Escherich G', 'Ferster A', 'Kotecha RS', 'Lausen B', 'Li CK', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Locatelli F', 'Marschalek R', 'Meyer C', 'Schrappe M', 'Stary J', 'Vora A', 'Zuna J', 'van der Velden VHJ', 'Szczepanski T', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Pieters R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9828-0834', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9285-6898', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6757-6173', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2955-4528', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1836-4075', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2810-5758', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7976-3654', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2997-3570']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2021/01/07 06:00,2021/09/16 06:00,['2021/01/06 17:11'],"['2022/02/20 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.02333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Feb 20;39(6):652-662. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.02333.

The exact pathogenesis remains unclear and several risk factors include chemoradiotherapy, infection, graft-versus-host disease, disease relapse, and secondary malignancy. Our case described a 42-year-old woman with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated by allo-HSCT 2 months later followed by a rare and atypical tongue neoplasia without oral pain, dysphagia, and dysgeusia. The biopsy was operated which showed granulation tissue with no evidence on typical graft-versus-host disease or malignancy, and no specific infection had been identified. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil, which were used for immunosuppression after allo-HSCT accompanying with the rapid growth of the tongue neoplasia, was then replaced by sirolimus. One month later, the patient underwent a complete remission unexpectedly.","['Qiu, Xi', 'Yu, Teng', 'Xu, Yang']","['Qiu X', 'Yu T', 'Xu Y']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Craniofac Surg,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,9010410,,,,2021/01/07 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/01/06 13:46'],"['2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 13:46 [entrez]']","['10.1097/SCS.0000000000007290 [doi]', '00001665-900000000-92957 [pii]']",ppublish,J Craniofac Surg. 2021 Jul-Aug 01;32(5):e452-e454. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000007290.,20210730,"['Copyright (c) 2020 by Mutaz B.

Genetic deficiency of this enzyme triggers apoptosis of activated T-cells due to the accumulation of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). Therefore, potential chemotherapeutic applications of human PNP inhibitors include the treatment of T-cell leukemia, autoimmune diseases and transplant tissue rejection. In this report, we present the discovery of novel HsPNP inhibitors by coupling experimental and computational tools. A simple, inexpensive, direct and non-radioactive enzymatic assay coupled to hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and UV detection (LC-UV using HILIC as elution mode) was developed for screening HsPNP inhibitors. Enzymatic activity was assessed by monitoring the phosphorolysis of inosine (Ino) to hypoxanthine (Hpx) by LC-UV. A small library of 6- and 8-substituted nucleosides was synthesized and screened. The inhibition potency of the most promising compound, 8-aminoinosine (4), was quantified through Ki and IC50 determinations. The effect of HsPNP inhibition was also evaluated in vitro through the study of cytotoxicity on human T-cell leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM). Docking studies were also carried out for the most potent compound, allowing further insights into the inhibitor interaction at the HsPNP active site. This study provides both new tools and a new lead for developing novel HsPNP inhibitors.","['Rabuffetti, Marco', 'Rinaldi, Francesca', 'Lo Bianco, Alessandra', 'Speranza, Giovanna', 'Ubiali, Daniela', 'de Moraes, Marcela Cristina', 'Rodrigues Pereira da Silva, Luiz Claudio', 'Massolini, Gabriella', 'Calleri, Enrica', 'Lavecchia, Antonio']","['Rabuffetti M', 'Rinaldi F', 'Lo Bianco A', 'Speranza G', 'Ubiali D', 'de Moraes MC', 'Rodrigues Pereira da Silva LC', 'Massolini G', 'Calleri E', 'Lavecchia A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2181-8026'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210217,Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*PNP inhibitors', '*antitumour activity', '*drug discovery', '*enzymatic assay', '*screening']",2021/01/07 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2021/01/06 12:25'],"['2020/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 12:25 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cmdc.202000874 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2021 Apr 20;16(8):1325-1334. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.202000874.

Dysregulation of lncRNA expression is act as a feature of various diseases and cancers, including hematopoietic malignancies. However, the clinical relevance of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia preceded by MDS (MDS-AML) requires further research. Recently, lncRNAs have been demonstrated, which play an important role in hematopoiesis, thus, to further finding more functional lncRNA seemed particularly important. METHODS: Western blotting, real-time PCR, RNA-pulldown, RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation), Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), cellular compartments extraction assays, SA-beta-gal staining, lentivirus transfection, cell viability assay and cell proliferation assays were used to examine the relationship between lncRNA LINC01255 and its regulation of p53-p21 pathway in human mesenchymal stromal and acute myeloid leukemia cells. RESULTS: LncRNA LINC01255 is highly expressed in bone marrow cells of AML patients, CD34+ cells of MDS-AML patients and AML cell lines and the higher expression of LINC01255 is associated with poor survival rate of AML patients. LINC01255 can interact with BMI1 and repress the transcription of MCP-1 to active p53-p21 pathway, thus inhibiting the senescence of human mesenchymal stromal and proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cell. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a novel functional lncRNA LINC01255, which can regulate the senescence of human mesenchymal stromal and the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cell through inhibiting the transcription of MCP-1.","['Liu, Q', 'Dong, J', 'Li, J', 'Duan, Y', 'Wang, K', 'Kong, Q', 'Zhang, H']","['Liu Q', 'Dong J', 'Li J', 'Duan Y', 'Wang K', 'Kong Q', 'Zhang H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7475-8613'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210106,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BMI1', 'MCP-1', 'MDS', 'lncRNA LINC01255']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/06 12:21'],"['2020/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 12:21 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-020-02505-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-020-02505-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Jun;23(6):1105-1116. doi: 10.1007/s12094-020-02505-5.

The authors report the first case, to our knowledge, of JMML presenting in a pediatric patient with a subdural hematoma. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-month old male with recurrent respiratory infections and a low-grade fever presented with a full fontanelle and an increasing head circumference and was found to have chronic bilateral subdural collections. Abusive head trauma, infectious, and coagulopathy workups were unremarkable, and the patient underwent bilateral burr holes for evacuation of the subdural collections. The postoperative course was complicated by the development of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and an acute subdural hemorrhage which required evacuation. Cytologic analysis of the subdural fluid demonstrated atypical cells, which prompted flow cytometric analysis, a bone marrow biopsy, and ultimately a diagnosis of JMML. Following chemotherapy, the patient's counts improved, and he subsequently underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. CONCLUSION: Subdural collections may rarely represent the first presenting sign of hematologic malignancies. In patients with a history of recurrent infections and a negative workup for abusive head trauma, clinicians should include neoplastic etiologies in the differential for chronic subdural collections and have a low threshold for fluid analysis.","['Lambert, William A', 'DiGiuseppe, Joseph A', 'Lara-Ospina, Tatiana', 'Bookland, Markus J', 'Martin, Jonathan E', 'Hersh, David S']","['Lambert WA', 'DiGiuseppe JA', 'Lara-Ospina T', 'Bookland MJ', 'Martin JE', 'Hersh DS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1177-2201'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210106,Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematoma', '*Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', '*Subdural', '*Thrombocytopenia']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2021/01/06 12:18'],"['2020/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 12:18 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00381-020-05013-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00381-020-05013-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2021 Jun;37(6):2075-2079. doi: 10.1007/s00381-020-05013-7.

Understanding the molecular mechanism of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes will be essential for developing new therapeutic approaches for ON demyelinating diseases. To this end, we developed a new method for isolation and culture of ON-derived oligodendrocyte lineage cells and used it to study OPC differentiation. A critical aspect of cellular differentiation is macroautophagy/autophagy, a catabolic process that allows for cell remodeling by degradation of excess or damaged cellular molecules and organelles. Knockdown of ATG9A and BECN1 (pro-autophagic proteins involved in the early stages of autophagosome formation) led to a significant reduction in proliferation and survival of OPCs. We also found that autophagy flux (a measure of autophagic degradation activity) is significantly increased during progression of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant change in mitochondrial dynamics during oligodendrocyte differentiation, which is associated with a significant increase in programmed mitophagy (selective autophagic clearance of mitochondria). This process is mediated by the mitophagy receptor BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like). BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial network formation, mitochondrial function and the viability of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes. Our studies provide novel evidence that proper mitochondrial dynamics is required for establishment of functional mitochondria in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings are significant because targeting BNIP3L-mediated programmed mitophagy may provide a novel therapeutic approach for stimulating myelin repair in ON demyelinating diseases.Abbreviations: A2B5: a surface antigen of oligodendrocytes precursor cells, A2B5 clone 105; ACTB: actin, beta; APC: an antibody to label mature oligodendrocytes, anti-adenomatous polyposis coli clone CC1; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG9A: autophagy related 9A; AU: arbitrary units; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; BNIP3: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3; BNIP3L/NIX: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; CASP3: caspase 3; CNP: 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase; Ctl: control; COX8: cytochrome c oxidase subunit; CSPG4/NG2: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4; DAPI: 4'6-diamino-2-phenylindole; DNM1L: dynamin 1-like; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FIS1: fission, mitochondrial 1; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP: glial fibrillary growth factor; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HsESC: human embryonic stem cell; IEM: immunoelectron microscopy; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MBP: myelin basic protein; MFN2: mitofusin 2; Mito-Keima: mitochondria-targeted monomeric keima-red; Mito-GFP: mitochondria-green fluorescent protein; Mito-RFP: mitochondria-red fluorescent protein; MitoSOX: red mitochondrial superoxide probe; MKI67: antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki 67; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; O4: oligodendrocyte marker O4; OLIG2: oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2; ON: optic nerve; OPA1: OPA1, mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase; OPC: oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; PDL: poly-D-lysine; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RGC: retinal ganglion cell; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RT-PCR: real time polymerase chain reaction; SEM: standard error of the mean; SOD2: superoxide dismutase 2, mitochondrial; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TMRM: tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; TUBB: tubulin, beta; TUBB3: tubulin, beta 3 class III.","['Yazdankhah, Meysam', 'Ghosh, Sayan', 'Shang, Peng', 'Stepicheva, Nadezda', 'Hose, Stacey', 'Liu, Haitao', 'Chamling, Xitiz', 'Tian, Shenghe', 'Sullivan, Mara L G', 'Calderon, Michael Joseph', 'Fitting, Christopher S', 'Weiss, Joseph', 'Jayagopal, Ashwath', 'Handa, James T', 'Sahel, Jose-Alain', 'Zigler, J Samuel Jr', 'Kinchington, Paul R', 'Zack, Donald J', 'Sinha, Debasish']","['Yazdankhah M', 'Ghosh S', 'Shang P', 'Stepicheva N', 'Hose S', 'Liu H', 'Chamling X', 'Tian S', 'Sullivan MLG', 'Calderon MJ', 'Fitting CS', 'Weiss J', 'Jayagopal A', 'Handa JT', 'Sahel JA', 'Zigler JS Jr', 'Kinchington PR', 'Zack DJ', 'Sinha D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3757-779X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6401-7715', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4831-1153']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210119,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATG9A', '*autophagy', '*autophagy flux', '*co-culture', '*demyelinating diseases', '*glial cells', '*mitochondrial dynamics', '*myelin', '*oligodendrocyte lineage cells', '*retinal ganglion cell axons']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/06 12:14'],"['2022/01/19 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2020.1871204 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2021 Oct;17(10):3140-3159. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2020.1871204.

However, the prognostic impact of comorbidities in patients with CML-CP treated with a second-generation TKI (2GTKI) has not been elucidated. We evaluated the effect of comorbidities on survival using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) in patients with CML-CP treated with imatinib or a 2GTKI (nilotinib and dasatinib). From April 2010 to March 2013, 506 patients with CML-CP were registered for the population-based cohort study, and 452 with a median age of 56 y were assessable. Treatment groups included 139 patients receiving imatinib, 169 receiving nilotinib, and 144 receiving dasatinib. Comorbidities were diagnosed in 99 patients. CCI scores were stratified as follows: 2, 353 patients; 3, 72 patients; and >/=4, 27 patients. Treatment response did not vary relative to CCI scores. However, across the entire cohort, the OS rate was significantly lower among patients with higher CCI scores than in those with a CCI score of 2 (94.4% in score 2, 89.0% in score 3, and 72.8% in score >/=4; P < .001). Multivariate analysis identified a CCI score of >/=4 as a strong adverse prognostic factor for OS rather than the disease-specific risk factor, older age, performance status, or selection of TKI (Wald test, P < .01). Our results demonstrated that comorbidities at diagnosis were the most important predictive factor for successful treatment, regardless of the TKI type used in CML-CP.

An early study reported high-frequency somatic mutations affecting UPF1, a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor, in PASC, but subsequent studies did not observe these lesions. The corresponding controversy about whether UPF1 mutations are important contributors to PASC has been exacerbated by a paucity of functional studies. Here, we modeled two UPF1 mutations in human and mouse cells to find no significant effects on pancreatic cancer growth, acquisition of adenosquamous features, UPF1 splicing, UPF1 protein, or NMD efficiency. We subsequently discovered that 45% of UPF1 mutations reportedly present in PASCs are identical to standing genetic variants in the human population, suggesting that they may be non-pathogenic inherited variants rather than pathogenic mutations. Our data suggest that UPF1 is not a common functional driver of PASC and motivate further attempts to understand the genetic origins of these malignancies.","['Polaski, Jacob T', 'Udy, Dylan B', 'Escobar-Hoyos, Luisa F', 'Askan, Gokce', 'Leach, Steven D', 'Ventura, Andrea', 'Kannan, Ram', 'Bradley, Robert K']","['Polaski JT', 'Udy DB', 'Escobar-Hoyos LF', 'Askan G', 'Leach SD', 'Ventura A', 'Kannan R', 'Bradley RK']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6570-1789', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8046-1063']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210106,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer biology', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'human', 'pancreatic cancer']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/06 08:41'],"['2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 08:41 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.62209 [doi]', '62209 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2021 Jan 6;10. pii: 62209. doi: 10.7554/eLife.62209.,,"['(c) 2021, Polaski et al.']","['Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States.', 'Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States.', 'Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program, University of Washington, Seattle, United States.', 'David M.

However, studies analysing cutaneous metastasis of haematological neoplasms are scarce. We describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of specific cutaneous manifestations of leukaemias, lymphomas, multiple myeloma (MM), and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDN) and make a review of the literature. METHODS: Data from 49 patients diagnosed with secondary cutaneous infiltration of systemic haematological neoplasms over the last 10 years in a tertiary dermatology centre were retrospectively collected, and clinical-evolutive features were analysed. RESULTS: Most cases were lymphoma (44.9%, n = 22), followed by leukaemia cutis (38.8%, n = 19), secondary plasmacytoma (10.2%, n = 5) and BPDN (6.1%, n = 3). Nodules were the predominant type of lesion, and most patients presented with multiple (>/=3) lesions. In 51% (n = 25) of cases, cutaneous infiltration was detected before the diagnosis of the underlying malignancy. The patients in diverse nosological groups did not differ in terms of survival (P = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: We recognise the clinical heterogeneity of specific cutaneous infiltrates. The high proportion of cases in which skin involvement was key to the diagnosis of systemic malignancy emphasises the role of the dermatologist in recognising and correctly managing these patients.","['Calado, Rebeca', 'Relvas, Maria', 'Morgado, Francisca', 'Cardoso, Jose Carlos', 'Tellechea, Oscar']","['Calado R', 'Relvas M', 'Morgado F', 'Cardoso JC', 'Tellechea O']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3661-9724', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2639-7494', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5006-4334', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7113-7061']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210105,Australia,Australas J Dermatol,The Australasian journal of dermatology,0135232,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', 'leukaemia cutis', 'lymphoma', 'plasmacytoma', 'skin infiltration']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:57'],"['2020/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 05:57 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajd.13533 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas J Dermatol. 2021 May;62(2):e228-e235. doi: 10.1111/ajd.13533.

Glomerular disease was suspected from urinalysis, which showed proteinuria and microscopic hematuria with red cell casts. Eventually, he died of respiratory failure, after which a postmortem was performed. In the glomeruli, the extracapillary space was filled with numerous mononuclear cells and erythrocytes. At first interpretation, the glomerular findings appeared to represent cellular crescents. However, immunostaining revealed that the extracapillary mononuclear cells were in fact leukemic cells. Furthermore, tubular injury due to marked accumulation of lysozyme was also recognized together with infiltration of leukemic cells in the interstitium. The diagnosis of kidney infiltration by chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and lysozyme-induced tubular injury was eventually made. Our case is the first report showing extracapillary infiltration of leukemic cells by immunostaining. In addition, lysozyme-induced tubular injury is a forgotten cause of kidney injury in patients with CMML. This case teaches us the rare and forgotten causes of AKI with CMML.","['Asano, Marina', 'Hase, Hanako', 'Naruse, Yuki', 'Kawada, Kyogo', 'Kojima, Iori', 'Branch, Joel', 'Kitamura, Hiroshi', 'Shimizu, Hideaki']","['Asano M', 'Hase H', 'Naruse Y', 'Kawada K', 'Kojima I', 'Branch J', 'Kitamura H', 'Shimizu H']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210106,Japan,CEN Case Rep,CEN case reports,101636244,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute kidney injury', '*Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*Extracapillary infiltration', '*Lysozyme-induced tubular injury']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:56'],"['2020/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 05:56 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13730-020-00567-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s13730-020-00567-6 [pii]']",ppublish,CEN Case Rep. 2021 Aug;10(3):320-325. doi: 10.1007/s13730-020-00567-6.

Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) has been shown to constitutively associate with BCR-ABL1, and IRS1-specific silencing leads to antineoplastic effects in CML cell lines. Here, we characterized the efficacy of NT157, a pharmacological inhibitor of IGF1R-IRS1/2, in CML cells and observed significantly reduced cell viability and proliferation, accompanied by induction of apoptosis. In human K562 cells and in murine Ba/F3 cells, engineered to express either wild-type BCR-ABL1 or the imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1(T315I) mutant, NT157 inhibited BCR-ABL1, IGF1R, IRS1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and STAT3/5 signaling, increased CDKN1A, FOS and JUN tumor suppressor gene expression, and reduced MYC and BCL2 oncogenes. NT157 significantly reduced colony formation of human primary CML cells with minimal effect on normal hematopoietic cells. Exposure of primary CML cells harboring BCR-ABL1(T315I) to NT157 resulted in increased apoptosis, reduced cell proliferation and decreased phospho-CRKL levels. In conclusion, NT157 has antineoplastic effects on BCR-ABL1 leukemogenesis, independent of T315I mutational status.","['Scopim-Ribeiro, Renata', 'Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Coelho-Silva, Juan Luiz', 'Fenerich, Bruna Alves', 'Fernandes, Jaqueline Cristina', 'Scheucher, Priscila Santos', 'Savage Stevens, Samantha L', 'de Melo Campos, Paula', 'Olalla Saad, Sara T', 'de Carvalho Palma, Leonardo', 'de Figueiredo-Pontes, Lorena Lobo', 'Simoes, Belinda Pinto', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Traina, Fabiola']","['Scopim-Ribeiro R', 'Machado-Neto JA', 'Eide CA', 'Coelho-Silva JL', 'Fenerich BA', 'Fernandes JC', 'Scheucher PS', 'Savage Stevens SL', 'de Melo Campos P', 'Olalla Saad ST', 'de Carvalho Palma L', 'de Figueiredo-Pontes LL', 'Simoes BP', 'Rego EM', 'Tognon CE', 'Druker BJ', 'Traina F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*Insulin receptor substrate 1', '*Leukemogenesis', '*NT157']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:55'],"['2020/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 05:55 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-020-01028-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-020-01028-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2021 Jun;39(3):736-746. doi: 10.1007/s10637-020-01028-8.

We previously showed that the blood group branched I antigen on the leukemia cell surface can regulate the cell susceptibility against natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity through interfering target-NK interaction. In this work, we first identified N-linkage as the major glycosylation linkage type for branched I glycan formation on leukemia cells, and this linkage was responsible for cell sensitivity against therapeutic NK-92MI targeting. Secondly, by examining different leukemia cell surface death receptors, we showed death receptor Fas had highest expressions in both Raji and TF-1a cells. Mutations on two Fas extracellular N-linkage sites (118 and 136) for glycosylation impaired activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis during NK-92MI cytotoxicity. Last, we found that the surface I antigen expression levels enable leukemia cells to respond differently against NK-92MI targeting. In low I antigen expressing K-562 cell, reduction of I antigen presence greatly reduced leukemia cell susceptibility against NK-92MI targeting. But in other high I antigen expressing leukemia cells, similar reduction in I antigen expression did not affect cell susceptibility.","['Wu, Yu-Xuan', 'Lu, Hsu-Feng', 'Lin, Yen-Hsi', 'Chuang, Hui-Yu', 'Su, Shih-Chi', 'Liao, Yi-Jen', 'Twu, Yuh-Ching']","['Wu YX', 'Lu HF', 'Lin YH', 'Chuang HY', 'Su SC', 'Liao YJ', 'Twu YC']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Fas', 'GCNT2', 'N-glycosylation', 'branched I antigen', 'natural killer cell']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:54'],"['2020/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 05:54 [entrez]']","['6063789 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cwaa117 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2021 Jun 3;31(5):624-635. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwaa117.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Acquired mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR converge on hyperactivation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) signaling as a central feature of MPN. Accordingly, JAK2 inhibitors have held promise for therapeutic targeting. After the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, similar JAK2 inhibitors as fedratinib are entering clinical use. While patients benefit with reduced splenomegaly and symptoms, disease-modifying effects on MPN clone size and clonal evolution are modest. Importantly, response to ruxolitinib may be lost upon treatment suggesting the MPN clone acquires resistance. Resistance mutations, as seen with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have not been described in MPN patients suggesting that functional processes reactivate JAK2 signaling. Compensatory signaling, which bypasses JAK2 inhibition, and other processes contribute to intrinsic resistance of MPN cells restricting efficacy of JAK2 inhibition overall. Combinations of JAK2 inhibition with pegylated interferon-alpha, a well-established therapy of MPN, B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibition, and others are in clinical development with the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Novel single-agent approaches targeting other molecules than JAK2 are being investigated clinically. Special focus should be placed on myelofibrosis patients with anemia and thrombocytopenia, a delicate patient population at high need for options. The extending range of new treatment approaches will increase the therapeutic options for MPN patients. This calls for concomitant improvement of our insight into MPN biology to inform tailored therapeutic strategies for individual MPN patients.","['Brkic, Sime', 'Meyer, Sara C']","['Brkic S', 'Meyer SC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201229,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,2021/01/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:01,['2021/01/06 05:54'],"['2020/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000516 [doi]'],epublish,Hemasphere. 2020 Dec 29;5(1):e516. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000516. eCollection 2021 Jan.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

The diagnosis of acute leukaemia is uncommon in our patients with sickle cell disease more so the patients have high morbidity and mortality due to the sickling process. Acute leukemia is a malignant clonal disorder of haemopoietic precursor cells resulting in accumulation of immature blood cells in the bone marrow and blood. The objective of the case series was to highlight the challenges of diagnosis and management of SCD patients with acute leukaemia, the importance of peripheral blood film review and propound a possible risk factor. Methods: Records of 58 patients diagnosed and managed for acute leukaemia over a 7 year period at the University College Hospital, Ibadan were reviewed. The diagnosis of acute leukaemia was based on clinical features in addition to peripheral and bone marrow smears findings. Microsoft excel version 2013 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Five (8.6%) of the patients with acute leukaemia also had sickle cell disease: 3 males and 2 females were described. Recurrent fever and anaemia were the most consistent presenting features in the patients. All the patients were not on any routine medications meant for SCD patients and had poor history of clinic attendance prior to the diagnosis of acute leukaemia. The diagnosis of acute leukaemia was not made until the patients were seen by a haematologist. The principal tool of diagnosis in all the patients was peripheral blood film review. Two patients were discharged against medical advice. The treatment period ranged between one month and one year in the remaining three patients. Conclusion: SCD patients are not exempted from developing acute leukaemias and the diagnoses of the two conditions overwhelms the social and economic support of patients and care givers. The study also underscores the relevance of high level of suspicion and prompt review of peripheral blood film of SCD patients particularly when patients present with unremitting symptoms associated with anaemia and fever.","['Aworanti, Oladapo W', 'Fasola, Foluke A', 'Kotila, Taiwo R', 'Olaniyi, John A', 'Brown, Biobele J']","['Aworanti OW', 'Fasola FA', 'Kotila TR', 'Olaniyi JA', 'Brown BJ']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Uganda,Afr Health Sci,African health sciences,101149451,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukaemia', 'anaemia', 'sickle cell disease']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:53'],"['2021/01/06 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4314/ahs.v20i3.36 [doi]', 'jAFHS.v20.i3.pg1304 [pii]']",ppublish,Afr Health Sci. 2020 Sep;20(3):1304-1312. doi: 10.4314/ahs.v20i3.36.,20210630,['(c) 2020 Aworanti OW et al.'],"['Haematology Department, Central Laboratory, Synlab Nigeria Limited, Lagos.', 'Department of Haematology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria.']",,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anemia/*etiology', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Nigeria', 'Young Adult']",,,,PMC7751539,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This study surveyed children's pain and distress levels immediately before and after a 1-hr in-person KKC class. Eligible participants were enrolled in standard KKC classes, were diagnosed with a chronic health condition (e.g., cancer, sickle cell) or were the sibling of a child diagnosed and were between the ages of 5-17 years (inclusive). Children reported on their pain and distress using Likert-style scales (Coloured Analog Scale and modified FACES scale, respectively). Friedman test was used to test for overall changes in pain and distress, and within subgroups. Age and sex effects were evaluated using Spearman's rank-order correlation. Additional Yes/No questions were administered regarding KKC satisfaction and use of techniques. Results: Fifty-nine youth (19 cancer patients, 17 non-cancer patients, 23 siblings; 5-17 yrs, 26 females) completed this study. Overall, there was a significant reduction in pain (p = 0.033) and emotional distress (p < 0.001) after a 1-hr class, with 50% and 89% of youth reporting a reduction in pain and distress, respectively. On average, pain levels remained within the mild/moderate range on average (i.e., pre vs. post levels; pre: M = 1.67, post: M = 1.33) and emotional distress went from mild/moderate to none/mild distress, on average (pre: M = 1.92, post: M = 1.08). Youth with higher pre-class pain and distress reported greater reductions (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The reduction in pain appeared to be most pronounced with cancer and non-cancer patients. In contrast, the reduction in distress appeared to be most pronounced among healthy siblings. However, overall, reductions in pain and distress did not significantly differ among subgroups (i.e., cancer patients, non-cancer patients, siblings), and change in pain and distress was not associated with age or sex. Ninety-six percent of youth would recommend KKC to others and 81% reported using KKC techniques (e.g., the Breath Brake(TM) or other martial arts techniques) outside of class, such as at home. Conclusion: Results support the more widespread application of KKC as a psychosocial intervention for reducing pain and distress in various pediatric populations.","['Marusak, Hilary A', 'Iadipaolo, Allesandra S', 'Cohen, Cindy', 'Goldberg, Elimelech', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Harper, Felicity W K', 'Bluth, Martin H', 'Rabinak, Christine A']","['Marusak HA', 'Iadipaolo AS', 'Cohen C', 'Goldberg E', 'Taub JW', 'Harper FWK', 'Bluth MH', 'Rabinak CA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0771-6795', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8646-9066', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8304-1825', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9810-4024']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201229,New Zealand,J Pain Res,Journal of pain research,101540514,,['NOTNLM'],"['leukemia', 'meditation', 'mindfulness', 'oncology', 'psychosocial', 'sickle cell']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:01,['2021/01/06 05:52'],"['2020/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 05:52 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JPR.S283364 [doi]', '283364 [pii]']",epublish,J Pain Res. 2020 Dec 29;13:3467-3478. doi: 10.2147/JPR.S283364. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Marusak et al.'],"['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Population Studies and Disparities Research Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Kids Kicking Cancer, Southfield, MI, USA.', 'Kids Kicking Cancer, Southfield, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Population Studies and Disparities Research Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Kids Kicking Cancer, Southfield, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.']",,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,['K01 MH119241/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7778380,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In our study, we retrospectively included patients of age group 1-15 years who were treated for ALL and survived induction. Data on weight, height and serum albumin levels recorded at the time of diagnosis of the patients were used in this study. For defining acute undernutrition we used weight-for-height, weight-for-age criteria for children </=5 years and body mass index for age >5 years. We correlated nutritional status of the patients with severe infection and mortality percentage. Results: There were 101 patients with male:female ratio of 2.4:1. Forty-four children were </=5 years and 57 children were >5 years of age. It was found that 74 children had B-cell ALL and 17 children had T-cell ALL; 54 patients were stratified as high-risk and 47 as standard-risk. In all, 52.5% patients had acute undernutrition at diagnosis. In ALL patients with acute undernutrition, severe infection was found to be 10.8% higher than ALL patients with normal nutrition which was statistically insignificant. Male children and children with serum albumin level <3.5 g/dL in the acute undernutrition group had higher risk of infection. Mortality percentage of patients with baseline acute undernutrition was found to be higher by 11% than normal nutrition group (P-value = 0.21). Conclusion: Our study highlights the magnitude of undernutrition at diagnosis in ALL patients in a tertiary care centre. It also correlates nutritional status with severe infection and mortality in follow-up.","['Sonowal, Rimjhim', 'Gupta, Vineeta']","['Sonowal R', 'Gupta V']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'severe infection', 'undernutrition']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:39'],"['2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 05:39 [entrez]']","['297011 [pii]', '10.4103/ijc.IJC_110_19 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2021 Apr-Jun;58(2):190-194. doi: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_110_19.,20211129,,"['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infections/epidemiology/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In real-world, alloSCT might not be readily available, but there is paucity of data on the optimal timing of alloSCT for these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this pilot study, we compared the outcomes of 13 patients undergoing alloSCT in CR1 with 13 patients undergoing alloSCT after relapse (non-CR1) to examine whether upfront alloSCT yields a better prognosis. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two groups with regards to relapse-free survival (p=0.507) and overall survival (p=0.798). There were more chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in the CR1 group compared to the non-CR group (p=0.001), but no difference in acute GVHD. CONCLUSION: The outcome of alloSCT after relapse is not inferior to that of alloSCT in CR1, supporting the role of alloSCT after relapse in the setting of limited donors and resources.","['Oh, Mi Jin', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Byun, Ja Min']","['Oh MJ', 'Shin DY', 'Koh Y', 'Hong J', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS', 'Byun JM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'intermediate risk']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:39'],"['2020/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['35/1/617 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.12299 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2021 Jan-Feb;35(1):617-622. doi: 10.21873/invivo.12299.,20210618,"['Copyright(c) 2021, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; jaminbyun@naver.com.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",,"['*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,PMC7880739,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the expression of MLL2 protein in gastric cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of MLL2 protein in cancer cell nuclei was studied by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of 529 human gastric cancers. MLL2 expression was classified into low and high expression from the point of zygosity, and its relationships with mismatch repair protein expression and clinicopathological features were examined. RESULTS: Low expression of MLL2 was associated with younger age, MSH6, and early cancers. MLL2-low pT1a cancers were associated with fibrosis, especially ulcer scars, and in 62.5% of them there was no direct contact between carcinoma and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: There is potentially an association between low expression of MLL2 protein and gastric malignancy from chronic fibrosis.","['Numakura, Satoe', 'Uozaki, Hiroshi']","['Numakura S', 'Uozaki H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Gastric cancer', 'MLL2 (KMT2D)', 'fibrosis', 'immunohistochemistry', 'ulcer scar']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:39'],"['2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['35/1/603 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.12297 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2021 Jan-Feb;35(1):603-609. doi: 10.21873/invivo.12297.,20210618,"['Copyright(c) 2021, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Department of Pathology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan uozaki@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']","['DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', '*Stomach Neoplasms/genetics']",,,,PMC7880768,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work is to describe the technique implementation, including treatment preparation, planning and dosimetric monitoring of TBI delivered in our institution from October 2016 to March 2019. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Prior to patient care, irradiation protocol was set up using physical phantoms. Gafchromic films were used to assess dose distribution homogeneity and evaluate imprecise patient positioning impact. Sixteen patients' irradiations with a prescribed dose of 12Gy were delivered in 6 fractions of 2Gy over 3 days. Pre-treatment quality assurance (QA) was performed for the verification of dose distributions at selected positions. In addition, in-vivo dosimetry was carried out using optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLD). RESULTS: Planning evaluation, as well as results of pre-treatment verifications, are presented. In-vivo dosimetry showed the strong consistency of OSLD measured doses. OSLD mean relative dose differences between measurement and calculation were respectively +0,96% and -2% for armpit and hands locations, suggesting better reliability for armpit OSLD positioning. Repercussion of both longitudinal and transversal positioning inaccuracies on phantoms is depicted up to 2cm shifts. CONCLUSION: The full methodology to set up TBI protocol, as well as dosimetric evaluation and pre-treatment QA, were presented. Our investigations reveal strong correspondence between planned and delivered doses shedding light on the dose reliability of OSLD for HT based TBI in-vivo dosimetry.","['Cleuziou, J-P', 'Desgranges, C', 'Henry, I', 'Jaumot, M', 'Chartier, P', 'Sihanath, R', 'Carre, M', 'Bulabois, C E', 'Cahn, J-Y', 'Pasteris, C', 'Balosso, J', 'Gabelle-Flandin, I', 'Verry, C', 'Giraud, J-Y']","['Cleuziou JP', 'Desgranges C', 'Henry I', 'Jaumot M', 'Chartier P', 'Sihanath R', 'Carre M', 'Bulabois CE', 'Cahn JY', 'Pasteris C', 'Balosso J', 'Gabelle-Flandin I', 'Verry C', 'Giraud JY']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210102,France,Cancer Radiother,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique,9711272,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Helical tomotherapy', 'Irradiation corporelle totale', 'Tomotherapie helicoidale', 'Total body irradiation']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/05/14 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:31'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/06 05:31 [entrez]']","['S1278-3218(20)30339-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canrad.2020.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Radiother. 2021 May;25(3):213-221. doi: 10.1016/j.canrad.2020.07.009.

We found that the proportion of NK cells in the bone marrow of ND-AML patients could predict the prognosis of patients by analyzing the types and expression abundance of NK related ligands in tumor cells. Furthermore, MCL1 inhibitor but not BCL2 inhibitor combined with NK cell-based immunotherapy could effectively improve the therapeutic efficiency via inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of AML primary cells as well as cell lines in vitro.

However, utilization of hepatoprotective agents or discontinuation of ATO may inhibit ATO efficacy. In order to maintain ATO effect from hepatoprotective agents' influence so we investigate relationships between single elevation in GGT and hepatocellular injury in this study. METHODS: Correlation of GGT variation and leukocyte counts were analyzed in all 81 APL patients, correlations among liver enzymes (ALT, AST and GGT) were also analyzed in patients without prophylactic hepatoprotective agents. In following study, we take the clinical observation of changes in aminotransferases in patients with single elevation in GGT without hepatoprotective agents. RESULTS: The average elevated GGT in the WBC abnormal group was more than the normal group (53.86U/L vs. 31.03U/L, P = 0.008), a positive Pearson's correlation of GGT variation and changed leukocyte counts in patients without prophylactic hepatoprotective agents. There are no significant correlation between aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and GGT but correlation between ALT and AST was statistically significant (R = 0.649, P = 0.000). For APL patients with single elevation in GGT, ALT and AST levels were normal throughout the ATO treatment without hepatoprotective agents. CONCLUSION: Single elevation in GGT without elevated aminotransferases can't be identified as hepatotoxicity, and the elevated levels of GGT are associated with increasing leukocyte counts. Continue single-agent ATO without prophylactic hepatoprotective agents is recommended in APL patients with single elevation in GGT, in order to maintain ATO effect.","['Sui, Meijuan', 'Wei, Hong', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Xiu, Ruolin', 'Shen, Xiaohan', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Sui M', 'Wei H', 'Zhang Q', 'Xiu R', 'Shen X', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhou J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Transaminase', 'arsenic trioxide', 'gamma-glutamyltransferase', 'hepatotoxicity']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:29'],"['2021/01/06 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1868782 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):58-64. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1868782.,20210510,,"[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Central Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Central Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China."", ""Central Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We retrospectively investigated the outcomes of 119 adult patients with Ph+ ALL in our center. The overall survival (OS) rate, leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rate, non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate and the impact of achievement of complete molecular response (CMR) within 3 months and sustaining CMR up to transplantation (s3CMR) on transplantation method were explored. Results: The estimated OS, LFS, CIR and NRM rates at 3 years were not significantly different among three groups (p = 0.960, 0.917, 0.375 and 0.096, respectively). For the 65 patients who achieved s3CMR, there was no significant difference in OS (84.5% vs 72.5% vs 100%, p = 0.374), LFS (75.2% vs 64.5% vs 83.3%, p = 0.668), CIR (17.2% vs 8.1% vs 16.7%, p = 0.583) and NRM (3.1% vs 23.4% vs 0%, p = 0.055) among auto-SCT group, MSD-SCT group and haplo-SCT group. However, in patients who did not achieve s3CMR, auto-SCT recipients tended to have higher CIR (60% vs 33.2% vs 24.0%, p = 0.013) than the allo-HSCT group. Conclusions: Auto-SCT with maintenance therapy after HSCT appears to be an attractive treatment option for patients with Ph+ ALL especially for those whose s3CMR was kept up to transplantation. For non-s3CMR patients, allogeneic transplantation may be more effective from lower relapse.","['Lyu, Mengnan', 'Jiang, Erlie', 'He, Yi', 'Yang, Donglin', 'Ma, Qiaoling', 'Pang, Aiming', 'Zhai, Weihua', 'Wei, Jialin', 'Huang, Yong', 'Zhang, Guixin', 'Zhang, Rongli', 'Feng, Sizhou', 'Han, Mingzhe']","['Lyu M', 'Jiang E', 'He Y', 'Yang D', 'Ma Q', 'Pang A', 'Zhai W', 'Wei J', 'Huang Y', 'Zhang G', 'Zhang R', 'Feng S', 'Han M']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['MSD-SCT', 'Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'auto-SCT', 'complete molecular response', 'haplo-SCT']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2021/01/06 05:29'],"['2021/01/06 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1868783 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):65-74. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1868783.,20210510,,"['National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Involvement of internal organs leads to the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM). The WHO classification divides SM into indolent SM, smoldering SM and advanced SM variants, including SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, aggressive SM, and MC leukemia. Historically, genetic analysis of individuals with pure cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and SM have focused primarily on cohort studies of inherited single nucleotide variants and acquired pathogenic variants. The most prevalent pathogenic variant (mutation) in patients with SM is KIT p.D816V, which is detectable in most adult patients. Other somatic mutations have also been identified-especially in advanced SM-in TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, RUNX1, CBL and JAK2, and shown to impact clinical and cellular phenotypes. Although only small patient cohorts have been analyzed, disease associations have also been identified in several germline variants within genes encoding certain cytokines or their receptors (IL13, IL6, IL6R, IL31, IL4R) and toll-like receptors. More recently, an increased prevalence of hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HalphaT) caused by increased TPSAB1 copy number encoding alpha-tryptase has been described in patients with SM. Whereas HalphaT is found in 3-6% of general Western populations, it is identified in up to 17% of patients with SM. In the current manuscript we review the prevalence, functional role and clinical impact of various germline and somatic genetic variants in patients with mastocytosis.","['Nedoszytko, Boguslaw', 'Arock, Michel', 'Lyons, Jonathan J', 'Bachelot, Guillaume', 'Schwartz, Lawrence B', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Schwaab, Juliana', 'Lange, Magdalena', 'Greiner, Georg', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Niedoszytko, Marek', 'Metcalfe, Dean D', 'Valent, Peter']","['Nedoszytko B', 'Arock M', 'Lyons JJ', 'Bachelot G', 'Schwartz LB', 'Reiter A', 'Jawhar M', 'Schwaab J', 'Lange M', 'Greiner G', 'Hoermann G', 'Niedoszytko M', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Valent P']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7270-1592', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3990-4408', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9148-9398', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9208-5264', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0917-4117', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7374-4380', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0456-5095']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210102,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['KIT variants', 'gene polymorphisms', 'hereditary alpha-tryptasemia', 'mast cell activation syndrome', 'mast cells', 'prognostication']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2021/01/06 01:01'],"['2020/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010411 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010411 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jan 2;22(1). pii: ijms22010411. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010411.,20210413,,"['Department of Dermatology, Allergology and Venereology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-211 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, APHP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere and Sorbonne University, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Universite de Paris, Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Hematological Disorders Team, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-188, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, APHP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere and Sorbonne University, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy & Immunology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Allergology and Venereology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-211 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ihr Labor, Medical Diagnostic Laboratories, 1220 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Allergology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-211 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-188, USA.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.']","['0 (ADGRE2 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL31 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MRGPRX2 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (PLCG2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']","['Cytokines/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Interleukins/genetics', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,PMC7795405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: children and adolescents with cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the six-month PAP (intervention group) or to the control group. The first evaluation was performed at the end of the PAP (T0 + 6 mo). At T0 + 6 mo, both groups received the six-month PAP with a second evaluation at T0 + 12 mo. The primary outcome was the evolution of exercise capacity measured using the six-minute walk test (6 MWT) at T0 + 6 mo. Secondary outcomes included PAP safety and changes in other physical functions, self-esteem, and quality-of-life parameters. RESULTS: The trial involved 80 children and adolescents (age range 5.0-18.4 years), of whom 41 were assigned to the interventional group and 39 to the control group. Underlying malignancies were leukemia (39%) and a broad range of solid tumors (61%). No adverse events occurred. At T0 + 6 mo, the evolution of the 6 MWT distance (+/-SEM) was improved in the intervention group vs. the control group (86 +/- 12 m vs. 32 +/- 6 m, p < 0.001). Several other physical parameters were significantly improved in the intervention group. Global self-esteem and parent-reported quality-of-life were significantly increased in the intervention group. Analysis at T0 + 12 mo showed persistence of the benefits in the intervention group on exercise capacity evolution (115 +/- 18 m vs. 49 +/- 11 m, p = 0.004) and on most physical and QoL parameters. CONCLUSION: In children and adolescents with cancer, a physical activity program is safe, improves exercise capacity, and may have physical and psychological benefits.","['Saultier, Paul', 'Vallet, Clothilde', 'Sotteau, Frederic', 'Hamidou, Zeinab', 'Gentet, Jean-Claude', 'Barlogis, Vincent', 'Curtillet, Catherine', 'Verschuur, Arnauld', 'Revon-Riviere, Gabriel', 'Galambrun, Claire', 'Chambost, Herve', 'Auquier, Pascal', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Andre, Nicolas']","['Saultier P', 'Vallet C', 'Sotteau F', 'Hamidou Z', 'Gentet JC', 'Barlogis V', 'Curtillet C', 'Verschuur A', 'Revon-Riviere G', 'Galambrun C', 'Chambost H', 'Auquier P', 'Michel G', 'Andre N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6327-0898', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6786-4968']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210102,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['child', 'exercise tolerance', 'neoplasms', 'quality of life', 'randomized controlled trials', 'sports']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:01,['2021/01/06 01:01'],"['2020/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13010121 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13010121 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jan 2;13(1). pii: cancers13010121. doi: 10.3390/cancers13010121.,,,"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, Aix Marseille University, INSERM, INRAe, C2VN, 13385 Marseille, France.', ""Association 'Sourire a la Vie', 13016 Marseille, France."", ""Association 'Sourire a la Vie', 13016 Marseille, France."", 'CEReS Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Hopital de la Timone, 13385 Marseille, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, Aix Marseille University, INSERM, INRAe, C2VN, 13385 Marseille, France.', 'CEReS Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Hopital de la Timone, 13385 Marseille, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", 'CEReS Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Hopital de la Timone, 13385 Marseille, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Immunology and Oncology, APHM, La Timone Children's Hospital, 13385 Marseille, France."", 'CRCM, Inserm U1068 Aix Marseille University, 13385 Marseille, France.']",,,,,"['NA/The Fondation ARC', 'NA/French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation', 'NA/INCa', 'NA/AG2R la Mondiale', 'NA/ARS PACA']",PMC7795208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were used to investigate antiproliferative effects. The degradation of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) was evaluated using immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Apoptosis was investigated using three-dimensional (3D) Jurkat cell resistance models. Lesbicoumestan induced potent mitochondrial depolarization on the Jurkat cells via upregulated expression levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the underlying apoptotic mechanisms of lesbicoumestan through the MALT1/NF-kappaB pathway were comprehensively elucidated. The analysis showed that lesbicoumestan significantly induced MALT1 degradation, which led to the inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, molecular docking results illustrate how lesbicoumestan could effectively bind with MALT1 protease at the latter's active pocket. Similar to traditional 2D cultures, apoptosis was markedly induced upon lesbicoumestan treatment in 3D Jurkat cell resistance models. Our data support the hypothesis that lesbicoumestan is a novel inhibitor of MALT1, as it exhibited potent antiapoptotic effects in Jurkat cells.","['Lee, Joo-Eun', 'Bo, Fang', 'Thuy, Nguyen Thi Thanh', 'Hong, Jaewoo', 'Lee, Ji Shin', 'Cho, Namki', 'Yoo, Hee Min']","['Lee JE', 'Bo F', 'Thuy NTT', 'Hong J', 'Lee JS', 'Cho N', 'Yoo HM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2495-1439', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2110-3781', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3456-3672', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4634-2228', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5951-2137']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210102,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['3D Jurkat cell', 'MALT1/NF-kappaB', 'ROS', 'lesbicoumestan', 'mitochondrial depolarization']",2021/01/07 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2021/01/06 01:01'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules26010185 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules26010185 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2021 Jan 2;26(1). pii: molecules26010185. doi: 10.3390/molecules26010185.,20210903,,"['Stem Cell Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, Daegu Catholic University School of Medicine, Daegu 42472, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 61469, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Korea.', 'Biometrology Group, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon 34113, Korea.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (MALT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Spheroids, Cellular']",,,"['NRF-2018R1C1B5083127/National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea', 'HCRI20013/Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital Research Institute of', 'Clinical Medicine', 'KRISS-2020-GP2020-0004/Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science']",PMC7794876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

International guidelines recommend semen cryopreservation to preserve the fertility of oncological adult males and pubertal boys. However, due to the low usage rate of banked samples, not a lot of data on assisted reproductive treatments (ART) success rates in this population and follow-up data for children born are available in the literature. The aims of this study were to report our 15 years of experience, the clinical outcomes of ART as well as neonatal characteristics of babies born. We retrospectively reviewed 682 oncological patients who were referred to our center from 2004 to 2019 for fertility preservation. Over the years, only 26 patients (4%) returned to use their sperm by ART. They were survivors of leukemia and lymphomas (52%), testicular cancer (20%), and other malignant diseases (28%).

Advance care planning (ACP) can allow these patients to express their care preferences before life-threatening illnesses. Objectives: To evaluate physicians' perspectives surrounding ACP in patients with HM. Methods: We administered a survey to intensivists and hematologic oncologists who care for patients with HM across Canada and the United Kingdom. Potential respondents were identified from institutions that have a hematologic-oncology program. The survey was disseminated electronically. Results: A total of 111 physicians completed the survey, with a response rate of 19% (39% across those who opened the e-mail); 52% of respondents were intensivists, and 48% of respondents were hematologic oncologists. Of the responses, 15.5% of physicians reported that ACP happens routinely at their institution, whereas 8.3% of physicians stated that code status is routinely discussed. ACP discussions were most commonly reported at the onset of critical illness (84.3% of respondents), during disease recurrence (52.9% of respondents), or during the transition to a strictly palliative approach (54.9% of respondents). Commonly cited barriers to ACP centered on physicians' concern about the reaction of the patient or family. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the need for earlier and more frequent ACP discussions in this high-risk population with a variety of barriers identified.","['Spring, Jenna', 'McKinlay, Jerrad', 'Puxty, Kathryn', 'Metaxa, Victoria', 'Detsky, Michael', 'Mehta, Sangeeta', 'Thyagu, Santhosh', 'McGuigan, Kelly', 'Munshi, Laveena']","['Spring J', 'McKinlay J', 'Puxty K', 'Metaxa V', 'Detsky M', 'Mehta S', 'Thyagu S', 'McGuigan K', 'Munshi L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5742-6171'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann Am Thorac Soc,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,101600811,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*advance care planning', '*critical illness', '*goals of care', '*leukemia', '*stem-cell transplant']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/01/05 20:07'],"['2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/05 20:07 [entrez]']",['10.1513/AnnalsATS.202006-678OC [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2021 Sep;18(9):1533-1539. doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.202006-678OC.,20211025,,"['Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care and.', 'Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', ""King's College Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom."", 'Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care and.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and.', 'Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care and.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care and.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and.']",,"['*Advance Care Planning', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', '*Physicians', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precise subtypes with distinct genomic and/or gene expression patterns have been recently revealed using high-throughput sequencing technology. Most of these profiles are associated with recurrent non-overlapping rearrangements or hotspot point mutations that are analogous to the established subtypes, such as DUX4 rearrangements, MEF2D rearrangements, ZNF384/ZNF362 rearrangements, NUTM1 rearrangements, BCL2/MYC and/or BCL6 rearrangements, ETV6-RUNX1-like gene expression, PAX5alt (diverse PAX5 alterations, including rearrangements, intragenic amplifications, or mutations), and hotspot mutations PAX5 (p.Pro80Arg) with biallelic PAX5 alterations, IKZF1 (p.Asn159Tyr), and ZEB2 (p.His1038Arg). These molecular subtypes could be classified by gene expression patterns with RNA-seq technology. Refined molecular classification greatly improved the treatment strategy. Multiagent therapy regimens, including target inhibitors (e.g., imatinib), immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, are transforming the clinical practice from chemotherapy drugs to personalized medicine in the field of risk-directed disease management. We provide an update on our knowledge of emerging molecular subtypes and therapeutic targets in BCP-ALL.","['Li, Jianfeng', 'Dai, Yuting', 'Wu, Liang', 'Zhang, Ming', 'Ouyang, Wen', 'Huang, Jinyan', 'Chen, Saijuan']","['Li J', 'Dai Y', 'Wu L', 'Zhang M', 'Ouyang W', 'Huang J', 'Chen S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210105,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BCP-ALL', 'aneuploidy', 'sequence mutations', 'subtypes', 'translocation']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/07/02 06:00,['2021/01/05 12:17'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/05 12:17 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11684-020-0821-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11684-020-0821-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Front Med. 2021 Jun;15(3):347-371. doi: 10.1007/s11684-020-0821-6.

However, disease control is not achievable in a minority of cases, most commonly due to evolution of TKI-resistant clones. There have also been rare cases of emergence of Ph-negative clones with other cytogenetic abnormalities, and, less commonly, development of Ph-negative acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whose molecular pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here we report molecular features of a patient with Ph + CML who developed Ph-negative AML after showing a major molecular response to dasatinib. A 55-year-old man was diagnosed with CML. He achieved a complete cytogenetic response three months after dasatinib therapy but developed AML with normal karyotype 1 year later. After receiving induction and consolidation chemotherapy for AML, the patient achieved complete remission with no evidence of CML under maintenance with bosutinib. Targeted sequencing of serial bone marrow samples identified mutations in IDH2 and NPM1 in the Ph-negative AML cells, which had not been detected in CML cells. These results suggest that Ph-negative AML in this patient originated from a preleukemic population, which might have expanded during or after the successful elimination of CML clones with TKI therapy.","['Nakamura, Fumi', 'Arai, Honoka', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Ichikawa, Motoshi', 'Furuichi, Shiho', 'Nagasawa, Fusako', 'Takahashi, Wataru', 'Handa, Tomoyuki', 'Nakamura, Yuko', 'Tanaka, Hiroko', 'Nakamura, Yuka', 'Sasaki, Ko', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Nakamura F', 'Arai H', 'Nannya Y', 'Ichikawa M', 'Furuichi S', 'Nagasawa F', 'Takahashi W', 'Handa T', 'Nakamura Y', 'Tanaka H', 'Nakamura Y', 'Sasaki K', 'Miyano S', 'Ogawa S', 'Mitani K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9736-9469'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210105,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Ph-negative acute myeloid leukemia', 'Targeted sequencing', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/01/05 12:17'],"['2020/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/05 12:17 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-03074-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-03074-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Jun;113(6):936-940. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-03074-7.

Azacitidine leads to complete remission even as second-line therapy and in patients with clonal evolution. We report a 70 years old female without previous exposure to myelotoxic drugs, presenting with three weeks with fatigue and dyspnea. She had anemia with normal white blood cell and platelet count. Bone marrow biopsy showed 50% cellularity and the karyotype analysis revealed a (5) (q33q34) deletion in 22% of the metaphases. A diagnosis of 5q-syndrome with low risk calculated using the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), was made. Since lenalidomide was not affordable, thalidomide 100 mg/day was initiated, achieving transfusion independence for three years. Afterwards, she developed pancytopenia and a bone marrow biopsy showed erythroid and megakaryocyte dysplasia with a complex karyotype, which worsened prognosis (IPSS-R of five points).

AIM: To characterize episodes of bacteremia caused by VGS in children with cancer who developed high-risk febrile neutropenia (HRFN) during the period from April 2004 to June 2018 in six pediatric hospitals of Santiago, Chile. METHOD: Database analysis of 4 successive, prospective and multicentric studies recording clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated strains. RESULTS: 95 episodes of VGS bacteremia in 91 children with HRFN were analyzed. It emphasizes acute myeloid leukemia as cancer type, deep neutropenia, prolonged hospitalization (15 days), with extended use of antimicrobials (14 days) and use of cytarabine in chemotherapy schemes (86% episodes). The most frequent clinical manifestations were respiratory and gastrointestinal, associating up to 26% viridans group shock syndrome. There was high resistance to beta lactams. As expected, there were not non-susceptible strains to vancomycin. DISCUSSION: VGS is a relevant microorganism in children with cancer, fever and neutropenia, with a high percentage of sepsis. Resistance to beta lactams is an issue that requires strict epidemiological surveillance in this population.","['Cortes, Daniel', 'Maldonado, Maria Eliana', 'Rivacoba, Maria Carolina', 'Maza, Veronica de la', 'Valenzuela, Romina', 'Paya, Ernesto', 'Contardo, Veronica', 'Alvarez, Ana Maria', 'Aviles, Carmen Luz', 'Becker, Ana', 'Salgado, Carmen', 'Tordecilla, Juan', 'Varas, Monica', 'Venegas, Marcela', 'Villarroel, Milena', 'Viviani, Tamara', 'Zubieta, Marcela', 'Santolaya, Maria Elena']","['Cortes D', 'Maldonado ME', 'Rivacoba MC', 'Maza V', 'Valenzuela R', 'Paya E', 'Contardo V', 'Alvarez AM', 'Aviles CL', 'Becker A', 'Salgado C', 'Tordecilla J', 'Varas M', 'Venegas M', 'Villarroel M', 'Viviani T', 'Zubieta M', 'Santolaya ME']",,['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Chile,Rev Chilena Infectol,Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,9305754,IM,,,2021/01/06 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2021/01/05 12:13'],"['2020/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 12:13 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0716-10182020000400383 [pii]', '10.4067/S0716-10182020000400383 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chilena Infectol. 2020 Aug;37(4):383-388. doi: 10.4067/S0716-10182020000400383.,20210308,,"['Programa de titulo de especialistas en Infectologia pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Programa de titulo de especialistas en Infectologia pediatrica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Exequiel Gonzalez Cortes, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Exequiel Gonzalez Cortes, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Roberto del Rio, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital San Juan de Dios, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital San Borja-Arriaran, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital Dr. Sotero del Rio, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Exequiel Gonzalez Cortes, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Roberto del Rio, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital San Juan de Dios, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital San Borja-Arriaran, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital Dr. Sotero del Rio, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Exequiel Gonzalez Cortes, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Chile.']",['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bacteremia/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Chile/epidemiology', '*Febrile Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', '*Streptococcal Infections/drug therapy']",,,,,,,,Caracterizacion clinica y microbiologica de episodios de bacteriemia por Streptococcus grupo viridans en ninos con cancer y neutropenia febril de alto riesgo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Posaconazole, commonly used to prevent invasive fungal infections in neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies, potently inhibits CYP3A4. The purpose of this evaluation was to predict venetoclax exposures following co-administration of posaconazole at doses not previously studied clinically. METHODS: Two physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were developed for posaconazole based on published parameters, one for an oral suspension and another for delayed released tablets. Parameter optimization, guided by sensitivity analyses, was conducted such that the models could replicate clinical exposures of posaconazole and drug-drug interactions with sensitive CYP3A substrates including venetoclax. The clinically verified posaconazole PBPK models were then utilized to predict DDI with a previously published venetoclax PBPK model at clinically relevant dosing scenarios. RESULTS: The posaconazole PBPK models predicted posaconazole exposure and DDI related fold changes with acceptable prediction errors for both posaconazole formulations. The model predicted exposures of venetoclax, when co-administered with a 300 mg QD dose of delayed release tablets of posaconazole, were in concordance with observed data. Increasing the posaconazole dose to 500 mg QD increased venetoclax exposures by about 12% relative to 300 mg QD, which were still within the venetoclax safe exposure range. CONCLUSIONS: The posaconazole PBPK models were developed and clinically verified. Predictions using the robust PBPK model confirmed the venetoclax label recommendation of 70 mg in the presence of posaconazole at doses up to 500 mg QD.","['Bhatnagar, Sumit', 'Mukherjee, Dwaipayan', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Miles, Dale', 'Menon, Rajeev M', 'Gibbs, John P']","['Bhatnagar S', 'Mukherjee D', 'Salem AH', 'Miles D', 'Menon RM', 'Gibbs JP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4410-8131'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210104,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CYP3A4', '*DDI', '*Dose adjustment', '*PBPK', '*Posaconazole', '*Venetoclax']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2021/01/05 06:27'],"['2020/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/05 06:27 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-020-04179-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-020-04179-w [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2021 Apr;87(4):465-474. doi: 10.1007/s00280-020-04179-w.

Here, we show that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 47 (USP47) is a potential target to overcome TKI resistance. Functional analysis shows that USP47 knockdown represses proliferation of CML cells sensitive or resistant to imatinib in vitro and in vivo. The knockout of Usp47 significantly inhibits BCR-ABL and BCR-ABL(T315I)-induced CML in mice with the reduction of Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-Kit(+) CML stem/progenitor cells. Mechanistic studies show that stabilizing Y-box binding protein 1 contributes to USP47-mediated DNA damage repair in CML cells. Inhibiting USP47 by P22077 exerts cytotoxicity to CML cells with or without TKI resistance in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, P22077 eliminates leukemia stem/progenitor cells in CML mice. Together, targeting USP47 is a promising strategy to overcome TKI resistance and eradicate leukemia stem/progenitor cells in CML.","['Lei, Hu', 'Xu, Han-Zhang', 'Shan, Hui-Zhuang', 'Liu, Meng', 'Lu,

In our context we are also facing the same problem. Hematological malignancies (HMs) are important component of cancer. Early diagnosis and proper treatment at right time, a good number of HMs patients can be cured or lengthening the survival period. For this purpose a proper diagnostic criteria should be developed in our settings. This research work is carried out to find out the clinicopathological findings of HMs in our population. This was a cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study conducted in the Department of Medicine and Hematology of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from July 2016 to June 2017. Total 45 patients were purposively selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria with a view to observe the clinical and laboratory findings. Mean age of the patients was 44.5 years. Highest average age (70 years) was found in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and lowest (29 years) in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Majority of the respondents were male in all HMs except in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) where male-female ratio was 0.3:7. Among male most of them were farmers or day laborers and most of the females were housewife. Almost all patients were exposed to single or multiple exposures like smoking, betel nut, betel leaf, tobacco leaf, fertilizer or pesticides. Acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) was the leading HMS with 31.11% representation followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 20%, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) 15.56%, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 11.11%, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 11.11%, multiple myeloma (MM)6.67% and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 4.44%. Duration of symptoms was vary from 2 days to 5 years. In acute leukaemia duration was short (average 2 months). Common clinical findings were anaemia (95.5%), fever (80.0%), hepatosplenomegaly (42.2%), lymphadenopathy (40.0%), bony tenderness (22.2%) and bleeding manifestations (15.5%). Some uncommon findings were also reported like menorrhagia, facial nerve palsy, arthritis and disorientation. Common laboratory abnormalities were high ESR, anaemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and immature cell in PBF especially in acute leukaemia. Clinical suspicion along with history of positive exposure indicates strong possibilities of haematological malignancies. It should be kept in mind that haematological malignancies may also present with some isolated uncommon findings.","['Islam, A S', 'Ara, Z G', 'Bhuiyan, G R', 'Khan, A U', 'Khan, M M']","['Islam AS', 'Ara ZG', 'Bhuiyan GR', 'Khan AU', 'Khan MM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Bangladesh,Mymensingh Med J,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,9601799,IM,,,2021/01/06 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/05 06:16'],"['2021/01/05 06:16 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mymensingh Med J. 2021 Jan;30(1):28-34.,20210106,,"['Dr ASM Shafiqul Islam, Assistant Registrar, Infectious and Tropical Disease, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Bangladesh; E-mail: milon20rpmc@gmail.com.']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bangladesh', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biochemical behaviour of these oncoproteins and their ability to cause unique diseases has been well studied, but the genomic basis of their differential action is unknown. To address this question we compared integrated phenotypic, transcriptomic, and genomic data from cells expressing four types of RUNX1 oncoproteins in an inducible fashion during blood development from embryonic stem cells. We show that each class of mutant RUNX1 deregulates endogenous RUNX1 function by a different mechanism, leading to specific alterations in developmentally controlled transcription factor binding and chromatin programming. The result is distinct perturbations in the trajectories of gene regulatory network changes underlying blood cell development which are consistent with the nature of the final disease phenotype. The development of novel treatments for RUNX1-driven diseases will therefore require individual consideration.","['Kellaway, Sophie G', 'Keane, Peter', 'Edginton-White, Benjamin', 'Regha, Kakkad', 'Kennett, Ella', 'Bonifer, Constanze']","['Kellaway SG', 'Keane P', 'Edginton-White B', 'Regha K', 'Kennett E', 'Bonifer C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4011-7460', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8738-9693', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6557-676X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4267-0825']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210104,United States,Life Sci Alliance,Life science alliance,101728869,IM,,,2021/01/06 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/01/05 06:13'],"['2020/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 06:13 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['4/2/e202000864 [pii]', '10.26508/lsa.202000864 [doi]']",epublish,Life Sci Alliance. 2021 Jan 4;4(2). pii: 4/2/e202000864. doi: 10.26508/lsa.202000864.

In all the reported cases, Cy was used as a part of the conditioning regimen, rather than post-transplant for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. More recently, the risk of HC in allogeneic SCT is further increased by the widespread use of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as a highly effective strategy for GVHD prophylaxis. This is the first case reported of PTCy-induced HC successfully treated with HBO to the best of our knowledge. CASE PRESENTATION: In this article, we present a 58-year-old Caucasian male case of allogeneic SCT complicated by severe HC following PTCy, which was successfully treated with HBO, eliminating the need for cystectomy. CONCLUSION: HBO can be a safe, noninvasive, alternative treatment modality for PTCy-induced HC developing in allogeneic SCT patients.","['Ibrahim, Moayed', 'Bhyravabhotla, Kshama', 'Khalaf, Basil', 'Van Meter, Keith', 'Saba, Nakhle S', 'Safah, Hana', 'Socola, Francisco']","['Ibrahim M', 'Bhyravabhotla K', 'Khalaf B', 'Van Meter K', 'Saba NS', 'Safah H', 'Socola F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0355-2380'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20210104,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Case report', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis', 'Hemorrhagic cystitis', 'Post-transplant']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/01/05 05:42'],"['2020/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 05:42 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-020-02580-w [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-020-02580-w [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2021 Jan 4;15(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s13256-020-02580-w.,20210514,,"['Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Deming Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Tulane University, 1430 Tulane Ave., Mailbox#8078, New Orleans, LA, 70112-2699, USA. mibrahim1@tulane.edu.', 'Section of Pediatrics-Internal Medicine, Deming Department of Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Section of Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Section of Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Deming Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Tulane University, 1430 Tulane Ave., Mailbox#8078, New Orleans, LA, 70112-2699, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Deming Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Tulane University, 1430 Tulane Ave., Mailbox#8078, New Orleans, LA, 70112-2699, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Deming Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Tulane University, 1430 Tulane Ave., Mailbox#8078, New Orleans, LA, 70112-2699, USA.']",['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', '*Cystitis/chemically induced/therapy', '*Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Hyperbaric Oxygenation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,,PMC7784006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To easily and rapidly measure titers of neutralizing antibodies in serum or plasma, we developed pseudovirion particles composed of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 incorporated onto murine leukemia virus capsids and a modified minimal murine leukemia virus genome encoding firefly luciferase. This assay design is intended for use in laboratories with biocontainment level 2 and therefore circumvents the need for the biocontainment level 3 that would be required for replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus. To validate the pseudovirion assay, we set up comparisons with other available antibody tests including those from Abbott, Euroimmun and Siemens, using archived, known samples. RESULTS: 11 out of 12 SARS-CoV-2-infected patient serum samples showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudotyped MLV viruses, with neutralizing titers-50 (NT50) that ranged from 1:25 to 1:1,417. Five historical samples from patients hospitalized for severe influenza infection in 2016 tested negative in the neutralization assay (NT50 < 25). Three serum samples with high neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2/MLV pseudoviruses showed no detectable neutralizing activity (NT50 < 25) against SARS-CoV-1/MLV pseudovirions. We also compared the semiquantitative Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, which measures binding of IgG to recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the neutralization titers obtained in the pseudovirion assay and the results show high concordance between the two tests (R(2) = 0.9344). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 spike/MLV pseudovirions provide a practical means of assessing neutralizing activity of antibodies in serum or plasma from infected patients under laboratory conditions consistent with biocontainment level 2. This assay offers promise also in evaluating immunogenicity of spike glycoprotein-based candidate vaccines in the near future.","['Zheng, Yue', 'Larragoite, Erin T', 'Williams, Elizabeth S C P', 'Lama, Juan', 'Cisneros, Isabel', 'Delgado, Julio C', 'Slev, Patricia', 'Rychert, Jenna', 'Innis, Emily A', 'Coiras, Mayte', 'Rondina, Matthew T', 'Spivak, Adam M', 'Planelles, Vicente']","['Zheng Y', 'Larragoite ET', 'Williams ESCP', 'Lama J', 'Cisneros I', 'Delgado JC', 'Slev P', 'Rychert J', 'Innis EA', 'Coiras M', 'Rondina MT', 'Spivak AM', 'Planelles V']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5318-2982'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210104,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibody', '*COVID-19', '*Coronavirus', '*Murine leukemia virus', '*Neutralization assay', '*Pseudotyped virus', '*SARS', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*Spike']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/01/15 06:00,['2021/01/05 05:40'],"['2020/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 05:40 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-020-01472-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-020-01472-1 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2021 Jan 4;18(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s12985-020-01472-1.,20210114,,"['Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'RetroVirox, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.', 'RetroVirox, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'AIDS Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology (CNM), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. vicente.planelles@path.utah.edu.']","['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus)', '0 (spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV)', 'EC 3.4.17.23 (ACE2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.17.23 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2)']","['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'COVID-19/*immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Neutralization Tests/*methods', 'SARS-CoV-2/*immunology', 'Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/*immunology', 'Virion/*immunology']",,,"['I01 CX001696/CX/CSRD VA/United States', 'AI143567-01/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7780907,,,,,,,,,,,,,['bioRxiv. 2020 Sep 21;:.

The increase in the bioavailability can be obtained with nanostructures. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of quercetin and its nanoemulsion on MDR and non-MDR cells. METHODS: We used high-pressure homogenization for nanoemulsion production; Trypan Blue for cytostatic/cytotoxicity assays; Epifluorescence microscope (with specific probes) for apoptosis and DNA damage; Real-Time PCR for gene expression; AutoDock Vina for docking and Flow Cytometry for efflux analysis. Quercetin exerted antiproliferative impact, induced apoptosis, necrosis and DNA damage on cells. RESULTS: Quercetin combined with vincristine showed an effect similar to verapamil (an ABCB1 inhibitor), and docking showed that it binds to ABCB1 in a similar region. Quercetin was also capable of altering ABCB1 gene expression. Quercetin in nanoemulsion maintained the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of quercetin, which may increase bioavailability. Besides, the unloaded nanoemulsion was able to inhibit per se the efflux activity of ABCB1, demonstrating pharmacological action of this structure. CONCLUSION: Quercetin may be considered as a prospective drug to overcome resistance in cancer cells and its nanoemulsion can be an alternative for in vivo application.","['Marques, Maiara B', 'Machado, Ayane P', 'Santos, Priscila A', 'Carrett-Dias, Michele', 'Araujo, Gabriela S', 'da Silva Alves, Barbara', 'de Oliveira, Barbara Santos', 'da Silva Junior, Flavio M R', 'Dora, Cristiana L', 'Canedo, Andres D', 'Filgueira, Daza M V B', 'Fernandes E Silva, Estela', 'de Souza Votto, Ana Paula']","['Marques MB', 'Machado AP', 'Santos PA', 'Carrett-Dias M', 'Araujo GS', 'da Silva Alves B', 'de Oliveira BS', 'da Silva Junior FMR', 'Dora CL', 'Canedo AD', 'Filgueira DMVB', 'Fernandes E Silva E', 'de Souza Votto AP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABCB1', '*DNA damage.', '*Docking', '*apoptosis', '*nanoemulsion', '*proliferation inhibition']",2021/01/06 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2021/01/05 05:38'],"['2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/05 05:38 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-113024 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520621999210104200722 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2021;21(14):1911-1920. doi: 10.2174/1871520621999210104200722.,20220117,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Fisiologicas, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas (ICB), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Cultura Celular, ICB, FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Fisiologicas, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas (ICB), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Fisiologicas, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas (ICB), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos- Graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos- Graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Pampa - UNIPAMPA, Sao Gabriel - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos- Graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos- Graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Pampa - UNIPAMPA, Sao Gabriel - RS, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Cultura Celular, ICB, FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Fisiologicas, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas (ICB), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Fisiologicas, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas (ICB), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande - RS, Brazil.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Emulsions)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Emulsions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Quercetin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,"['FINANCE CODE 001/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -', 'Brasil (CAPES)', '2951/2014/National Program for Academic Cooperation (PROCAD/CAPES)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study Design: A case control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China, from January 2011 to June 2020. METHODOLOGY: Quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to detect ANXA1 and DICER1 expression levels in the bone marrow from 49 MDS patients and 12 healthy volunteers as control. The correlation of the clinical parameters and ANXA1 or DICER1 expression was then analysed in MDS. RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, the expression of bone marrow ANXA1 and DICER1 in MDS patients was significantly decreased, especially in patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML). Moreover, down-expression of ANXA1 had a great effect on differentiating s-AML subjects from MDS cases, and DICER1 expression showed good performance to screen MDS subjects from normal controls. ANXA1 expression was negatively correlated with clinical features of poor prognosis such as the percentage of bone marrow blasts, IPSS and WHO subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow ANXA1 may be a potential biomarker for the risk prediction of leukemia transformation in MDS. DICER1 may have diagnostic significance to MDS.

Methods: A total of 280 patients were retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2018 in Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Clinical data were collected including disease patterns, pre-transplantation status, chromosome karyotype, conditioning regimen, types of donor, extramedullary disease before transplantation and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were uesd for univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, respectively. Results: Twenty patients developed EMR (7.14%). The median time of EMR was 7.5 (1-123) months after allo-HSCT. The mortality of EMR was 80% (16/20). Univariate analysis identified disease patterns, second complete remission (CR2) or progressive disease before transplantation, extramedullary disease, abnormal karyotype and conditioning regimen without total body radiation as significant factors correlated to EMR (P<0.05). Multi-variable analysis revealed that CR2 or progressive disease (RR=3.468,95%CI 2.189-7.786), abnormal karyotype (RR=1.494,95%CI 1.020-2.189) and extramedullary disease before transplantation (RR=8.627,95%CI 3.921-18.452) were independent risk factors of EMR.

Methods: Forty-five serous effusion specimens with final diagnosis of LBL/ALL were collected from August 2011 to December 2019 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. All cases were reviewed for their clinical profiles, cytomorphologic features and ancillary studies. Cell blocks and immunocytochemistry were prepared in 22 cases; flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed in three cases and gene rearrangement analysis (T-cell recepter, TCR and immunoglobulin, Ig) was performed in five cases. Results: Among the 45 cases, there were 35 males and 10 females with male to female ratio of 3.5ratio1.0. The median age was 15 years. Mediastinal mass was the initial presentation in 39 patients (86.7%) and high LDL level were observed in 34 patients (75.6%). Microscopically, the majority of the specimens (86.7%) were hypercellular. The smears demonstrated dispersed lymphoblasts that were predominantly small to intermediate in size with scanty basophilic cytoplasm and irregular or convoluted nuclei with fine chromatin condensation and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitoses were frequently observed. Karyorrhexis and apoptosis were seen in all cases. By immunophenotyping, TdT was expressed in 19 cases (86.4%) and CD99 in 20 cases (90.9%). Ki-67 expression varied from 65% to 95%. Flow cytometry in three cases demonstrated positivity for TdT, CD2, CD3 and CD7. Monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement was found in 4 of 5 cases, and both monoclonal TCR and Igkappa gene were found in 1 case. Conclusions: In LBL/ALL, primary diagnosis could be made basing on clinical features (younger male patients with a mediastinum mass) and cytomorphology (monotonous, small to medium sized lymphoid cells with prominent irregular nuclei, fine chromatin and frequent mitoses, karyorrhexis and apoptosis). If immunocytochemistry and other ancillary studies are performed, the accuracy and reliability of the results could be improved.","['Xiao, L', 'Xu, J J', 'Zhang, D D', 'Wei, N', 'Kou, J N', 'Li, S L', 'Li, W C']","['Xiao L', 'Xu JJ', 'Zhang DD', 'Wei N', 'Kou JN', 'Li SL', 'Li WC']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytological techniques', 'Gene rearrangement', 'Leukemia, lymphocytic, chronic, B-cell']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/05 02:30'],"['2021/01/05 02:30 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200415-00319 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Jan 8;50(1):49-54. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200415-00319.,20210106,,"['Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",,"['Adolescent', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,"['Wjlx2018021/Medical Education Research Project of Henan Province of China', 'LHGJ20190235/Joint Construction Project of Henan Provincial Department of Medical', 'Science and Technology Research']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High genetic variability of HIV complicates the development of anti-HIV vaccine, and there is an actual clinical need for increasing the efficiency of anti-HIV drugs in terms of targeted delivery and controlled release. Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide-analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has gained wide acceptance as a drug for pre-exposure prophylaxis or treatment of HIV infection. In our study, we explored the potential of tenofovir disoproxil (TFD) adducts with block copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether and poly(ethylene phosphoric acid) (mPEG-b-PEPA) as candidates for developing a long-acting/controlled-release formulation of TFV. Two types of mPEG-b-PEPA with numbers of ethylene phosphoric acid (EPA) fragments of 13 and 49 were synthesized by catalytic ring-opening polymerization, and used for preparing four types of adducts with TFD. Antiviral activity of [mPEG-b-PEPA]TFD or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was evaluated using the model of experimental HIV infection in vitro (MT-4/HIV-1IIIB). Judging by the values of the selectivity index (SI), TFD exhibited an up to 14-fold higher anti-HIV activity in the form of mPEG-b-PEPA adducts, thus demonstrating significant promise for further development of long-acting/controlled-release injectable TFV formulations.","[""Nifant'ev, Ilya"", 'Siniavin, Andrei', 'Karamov, Eduard', 'Kosarev, Maxim', 'Kovalchuk, Sergey', 'Turgiev, Ali', 'Nametkin, Sergey', 'Bagrov, Vladimir', 'Tavtorkin, Alexander', 'Ivchenko, Pavel']","[""Nifant'ev I"", 'Siniavin A', 'Karamov E', 'Kosarev M', 'Kovalchuk S', 'Turgiev A', 'Nametkin S', 'Bagrov V', 'Tavtorkin A', 'Ivchenko P']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9151-1890', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7576-2059', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0181-5952']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201230,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AIDS', 'HIV', 'PrEP', 'cART', 'controlled release', 'injectable formulations', 'long-acting drugs', 'poly(phosphoric acid)', 'polyphosphoesters', 'ring-opening polymerization', 'tenofovir']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2021/01/05 01:19'],"['2020/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 01:19 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010340 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010340 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 30;22(1). pii: ijms22010340. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010340.,20210402,,"['Chemistry Department, M.V.

Diagnosis currently relies on non-specific chest CT, culture of the fungus from invasive lung biopsy, and detection of the cell wall carbohydrate galactomannan (GM) in serum or in BAL fluids recovered during invasive bronchoscopy. Urine provides an ideal bodily fluid for the non-invasive detection of pathogen biomarkers, with current urine-based immunodiagnostics for IPA focused on GM. Surrogate protein biomarkers might serve to improve disease detection. Here, we report the development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), PD7, which is specific to A. fumigatus and related species in the section Fumigati, and which binds to its 18 kDa ribotoxin Asp f I. Using PD7, we show that the protein is secreted during hyphal development, and so represents an ideal candidate for detecting invasive growth. We have developed a lateral-flow device (Afu-LFD((R))) incorporating the mAb which has a limit of detection of ~15 ng Asp f I/mL urine. Preliminary evidence of the test's diagnostic potential is demonstrated with urine from a patient with acute lymphoid leukaemia with probable IPA. The Afu-LFD((R)) therefore provides a potential novel opportunity for non-invasive urine-based detection of IPA caused by A. fumigatus.","['Davies, Genna', 'Singh, Oski', 'Prattes, Juergen', 'Hoenigl, Martin', 'Sheppard, Paul W', 'Thornton, Christopher R']","['Davies G', 'Singh O', 'Prattes J', 'Hoenigl M', 'Sheppard PW', 'Thornton CR']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2482-6734', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5751-9311', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1653-2824', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6213-3130']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201231,Switzerland,J Fungi (Basel),"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",101671827,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asp f I', 'Aspergillus fumigatus', 'lateral-flow device', 'monoclonal antibody', 'ribotoxin', 'urine']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/01/06 06:01,['2021/01/05 01:13'],"['2020/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 01:13 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:01 [medline]']","['jof7010019 [pii]', '10.3390/jof7010019 [doi]']",epublish,J Fungi (Basel). 2020 Dec 31;7(1). pii: jof7010019. doi: 10.3390/jof7010019.,,,"['ISCA Diagnostics Ltd., Hatherly Laboratories, Prince of Wales Road, Exeter EX4 4PS, UK.', 'Biosciences and MRC Centre for Medical Mycology, University of Exeter, Hatherly Laboratories, Prince of Wales Road, Exeter EX4 4PS, UK.', 'Biosciences and MRC Centre for Medical Mycology, University of Exeter, Hatherly Laboratories, Prince of Wales Road, Exeter EX4 4PS, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical University of Graz, A-8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical University of Graz, A-8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.', 'Vacye Associates, Lowerdown Cottage, Lowerdown, Bovey Tracey TQ13 9LF, UK.', 'ISCA Diagnostics Ltd., Hatherly Laboratories, Prince of Wales Road, Exeter EX4 4PS, UK.', 'Biosciences and MRC Centre for Medical Mycology, University of Exeter, Hatherly Laboratories, Prince of Wales Road, Exeter EX4 4PS, UK.']",,,"['C.

Vanillic acid (V.A), a flavoring agent, is a benzoic acid derivative having a broad range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of V.A in exerting neuroprotection are not well investigated. The present study aims to explore the neuroprotective effects of V.A against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, synaptic/memory dysfunction, and neurodegeneration in mice brain. Behavioral tests and biochemical and immunofluorescence assays were applied. Our results indicated increased expression of RAGE and its downstream phospho-c-Jun n-terminal kinase (p-JNK) in the LPS-alone treated group, which was significantly reduced in the V.A + LPS co-treated group. We also found that systemic administration of LPS-injection induced glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) activation and significantly increased expression level of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-KB) and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL1-beta), and cyclooxygenase (COX-2). However, V.A + LPS co-treatment significantly inhibited the LPS-induced activation of glial cells and neuroinflammatory mediators. Moreover, we also noted that V.A treatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in the expression of AD markers, such as beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and amyloid-beta (Abeta). Furthermore, V.A treatment significantly reversed LPS-induced synaptic loss via enhancing the expression level of pre- and post-synaptic markers (PSD-95 and SYP), and improved memory performance in LPS-alone treated group. Taken together; we suggest that neuroprotective effects of V.A against LPS-induced neurotoxicity might be via inhibition of LPS/RAGE mediated JNK signaling pathway; and encourage future studies that V.A would be a potential neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic candidate in various neurological disorders.","['Ullah, Rahat', 'Ikram, Muhammad', 'Park, Tae Ju', 'Ahmad, Riaz', 'Saeed, Kamran', 'Alam, Sayed Ibrar', 'Rehman, Inayat Ur', 'Khan, Amjad', 'Khan, Ibrahim', 'Jo, Min Gi', 'Kim, Myeong Ok']","['Ullah R', 'Ikram M', 'Park TJ', 'Ahmad R', 'Saeed K', 'Alam SI', 'Rehman IU', 'Khan A', 'Khan I', 'Jo MG', 'Kim MO']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5226-4081', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7411-9483', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2863-6989']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201231,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['amyloidogenesis', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinases', 'lipopolysaccharide', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neuroinflammation', 'synaptic and memory impairment', 'vanillic acid']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2021/01/05 01:12'],"['2020/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 01:12 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010361 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010361 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 31;22(1). pii: ijms22010361. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010361.,20210325,,"['Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences (MVLS), University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12OZD, UK."", 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.']","['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GM8Q3JM2Y8 (Vanillic Acid)']","['Animals', 'Brain/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gliosis/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Vanillic Acid/*pharmacology']",,,,PMC7795830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this research, dried aerial parts of A. virginicus were extracted, applying Soxhlet and liquid-liquid phase methods to acquire the total crude (T-Anvi), hexane (H-Anvi), ethyl acetate (E-Anvi), butanol (B-Anvi), and water (W-Anvi) extracts, respectively. In which, T-Anvi contains the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents (24.80 mg gallic acid and 37.40 mg rutin equivalents per g dry weight, respectively). Via anti-radical (ABTS and DPPH), and reducing power assays, E-Anvi exhibits the most potent activities (IC50 = 13.96, 43.59 and 124.11 microg/mL, respectively), stronger than butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a standard antioxidant, while the lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of E-Anvi (LPI = 90.85% at the concentration of 500 microg/mL) is close to BHT. E-Anvi shows the most substantial inhibition (IC50 = 2.58 mg/mL) on tyrosinase. Notably, alpha-amylase is significantly suppressed by H-Anvi (IC50 = 0.72 mg/mL), over twice stronger than the positive control, palmitic acid. In the cytotoxic assay, E-Anvi is the strongest extract inhibiting K562 cells (IC50 = 112.01 microg/mL). Meanwhile, T-Anvi shows the highest prevention on Meg-01 expansion (IC50 = 91.40 microg/mL). Dominant compounds detected in E-Anvi by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) are identified as flavonoids.

Classical tumor suppressor genes are recessive in nature, anti-proliferative, and frequently found inactivated or mutated in cancers. However, extensive research over the last few years have elucidated that certain tumor suppressor genes do not conform to these standard definitions and might act as ""double agents"", playing contrasting roles in vivo in cells, where either due to haploinsufficiency, epigenetic hypermethylation, or due to involvement with multiple genetic and oncogenic events, they play an enhanced proliferative role and facilitate the pathogenesis of cancer. This review discusses and highlights some of these exceptions; the genetic events, cellular contexts, and mechanisms by which four important tumor suppressors-pRb, PTEN, FOXO, and PML display their oncogenic potentials and pro-survival traits in cancer.","['Datta, Neerajana', 'Chakraborty, Shrabastee', 'Basu, Malini', 'Ghosh, Mrinal K']","['Datta N', 'Chakraborty S', 'Basu M', 'Ghosh MK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201231,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXO', '*PML', '*PTEN', '*Rb', '*cancer', '*tumor suppressor genes']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2021/01/05 01:10'],"['2020/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 01:10 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10010046 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10010046 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Dec 31;10(1). pii: cells10010046. doi: 10.3390/cells10010046.,20210628,,"['Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB), TRUE Campus, CN-6, Sector-V, Salt Lake, Kolkata-700091 & 4, Raja S.C.

S-metolachlor is a selective herbicide that inhibits cell division and mitosis via enzyme interference. The herbicide is used globally in agriculture and studies report adverse effects in aquatic organisms; however, there are no studies investigating sub-lethal effects of S-metolachlor on swim bladder formation, mitochondrial ATP production, nor light-dark preference behaviors in fish. These endpoints are relevant for larval locomotor activity and metabolism. To address these knowledge gaps, we exposed zebrafish embryos/larvae to various concentrations of S-metolachlor (0.5-50 microM) over early development. S-metolachlor affected survival, hatching percentage, and increased developmental deformities at concentrations of 50 microM and above. Exposure levels as high as 200 microM for 24 and 48 h did not alter oxygen consumption rates in zebrafish, and there were no changes detected in endpoints related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We observed impairment of swim bladder inflation at 50 microM in 6 dpf larvae. To elucidate mechanisms related to this, we measured relative transcript abundance for genes associated with the swim bladder (smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin, annexin A5, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a). Smooth muscle alpha (alpha)-2 actin mRNA levels were reduced in fish exposed to 50 microM while annexin A5 mRNA levels were increased in abundance, corresponding to reduced swim bladder size in larvae. A visual motor response test revealed that larval zebrafish exhibited some hyperactivity in the light with exposure to the herbicide and only the highest dose tested (50 microM) resulted in hypoactivity in the dark cycle. Regression analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship between surface area of the swim bladder and distance traveled, and the size of the swim bladder explained ~10-14% in the variation for total distance moved. Lastly, we tested larvae in a light dark preference test, and we did not detect any altered behavioral response to any concentration tested. Here we present new data on sublethal endpoints associated with exposure to the herbicide S-metolachlor and demonstrate that this chemical may disrupt transcripts associated with swim bladder formation and morphology, which could ultimately affect larval zebrafish activity. These data are expected to contribute to further risk assessment guidelines for S-metolachlor in aquatic ecosystems.","['Yang, Lihua', 'Ivantsova, Emma', 'Souders, Christopher L 2nd', 'Martyniuk, Christopher J']","['Yang L', 'Ivantsova E', 'Souders CL 2nd', 'Martyniuk CJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201119,Netherlands,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,7805381,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Agrochemical', 'Behavior', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Oxidative phosphorylation', 'Pesticide Toxicity', 'Risk assessment']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/01/30 06:00,['2021/01/05 01:09'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 01:09 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0147-6513(20)31478-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111641 [doi]']",ppublish,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf. 2021 Jan 15;208:111641. doi: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111641.

It manifests several major adverse health issues to millions of arsenic exposed populations. Arsenic is associated with different types of cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, hypertension and many other diseases. On the contrary, arsenic (arsenic trioxide, As2O3) is used as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Balance between arsenic induced cellular proliferations and apoptosis finally decide the outcome of its transformation rate. Arsenic propagates signals via cellular and nuclear pathways depending upon the chemical nature, and metabolic-fates of the arsenical compounds. Arsenic toxicity is propagated via ROS induced stress to DNA-repair mechanism and mitochondrial stability in the cell. ROS induced alteration in p53 regulation and some mitogen/ oncogenic functions determine the transformation outcome influencing cyclin-cdk complexes. Growth factor regulator proteins such as c-Jun, c-fos and c-myc are influenced by chronic arsenic exposure. In this review we have delineated arsenic induced ROS regulations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), NF-kbeta, MAP kinase, matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). The role of these signaling molecules has been discussed in relation to cellular apoptosis, cellular proliferation and neoplastic transformation. The arsenic stimulated pathways which help in proliferation and neoplastic transformation ultimately resulted in cancer manifestation whereas apoptotic pathways inhibited carcinogenesis. Therapeutic strategies against arsenic should be designed taking into account all these factors.","['Medda, Nandita', 'De, Subrata Kumar', 'Maiti, Smarajit']","['Medda N', 'De SK', 'Maiti S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201211,Netherlands,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,7805381,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Arsenic signaling', 'Cell cycle factors', 'EGFR', 'MAPK', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'NF-kbeta', 'Neoplastic transformation', 'Nrf-2', 'P53', 'ROS']",2021/01/06 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2021/01/05 01:08'],"['2020/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0147-6513(20)31588-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111752 [doi]']",ppublish,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf. 2021 Jan 15;208:111752. doi: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111752.

CLL presents with clonal expansion and accumulation of CD5+CD19+CD23+ cells in peripheral lymphoid organs and tissues and in bone marrow. The disease remains incurable, albeit there are new molecular and immunotherapy methods currently available, which, in conjunction with chemotherapy, lead to the ""precision therapy"" approach. The majority of immunotherapies are based on the ability of therapeutic antibodies to mobilize anti-tumour potential of immune responses. Bispecific antibodies (BsAb) are also considered in the treatment of CLL, whereby phagocytic cells play a key effector role in the destruction of the target CLL cells. Anti-CD19/anti-CD64 BsAb binds to CD19 receptors on CLL cells and to CD64 receptors (FcgammaRI) on monocytes and activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), thus inducing phagocytosis of the leukaemic cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of anti-CD19/CD64 BsAb to enhance adherence of CLL cells by PMNs, intact or activated with G-CSF and IFNgamma cytokines. Membranes of the isolated CLL cells of 16 patients were stained with Red Fluoresent Linker and CLL cells were co-incubated with isolated autologous PMNs, intact or pre-stimulated with G-CSF and/or IFNgamma for 4h or 24h. The PMN/CLL cell adhesion was analyzed with the FACScan flow cytometer by gating on PMNs with adhered RFL-stained CLL cells. The results were heterogenous. Our data demonstrate that anti-CD19/anti-CD64 BsAb has limited capacity to enhance leukemic cell attachment by autologous PMNs. This could partially be explained by the remarkable intensity of spontaneous ability of PMNs to adhere to autologous CLL cells. Pre-treatment of PMNs from CLL patients with G-CSF and INFgamma, alone or jointly did not enhance the adhesion of the leukaemic cells. Moreover, G-CSF and IFNgamma joint effect led to the reduction in the adhesion capacity of the effector PMNs. It appears, that therapeutic effect of anti-CD19/anti-CD64 BsAb on enhancing attachment of leukaemic cells to PMNs in CLL patients is limited and its application should be based on the assessment of individual capacity of the patients' phagocytic cells.","['Tsertsvadze, T', 'Mitskevich, N', 'Datikashvili-David, I', 'Ghirdaladze, D', 'Porakishvili, N']","['Tsertsvadze T', 'Mitskevich N', 'Datikashvili-David I', 'Ghirdaladze D', 'Porakishvili N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Georgia (Republic),Georgian Med News,Georgian medical news,101218222,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/04 20:06'],"['2021/01/04 20:06 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Georgian Med News. 2020 Nov;(308):118-123.,20210106,,"['1Iv.

The research had shown the results of treatment of 41 children with CHB in remission of ALL aged from 3 to 17 years old, who were on dispensary observation in Vinnytsia Regional Children's Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital during 2013-2017 years. Patients were devided into the following groups: the comparison group (group A), which included 18 children with CHB in remission of ALL, who received basis therapy; the main group (group B) which consisted of 23 patients with CHB in remission of ALL, who got betaine arginine complex (<<Betargin>>) in addition to basis therapy. The control group was formed out of 30 healthy children. Determination of effectivity of the proposed treatment regimen was performed by studying the indicators of cholestasis, cytolysis, hepatocellular insufficiency, and lipid metabolism. To assess the liver's fibrosis level and necroinflammatory activity we used the determination of the level of plasma osteopontin in the serum using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method: Human Osteopontin Quantikine (RDD systems, Dos Too, Minneapolis, MS, USA). The verification of the diagnosis of CHB was based on the detection of specific markers of HBV-infection in blood using ELISA and PCR analysis. During our scientific research we established that using betaine arginine complex in management of CHB in remission of ALL led to considerable improvement of children's general condition, namely due to reducing (p<0,05) the incidence of asthenovegetative (8.6% against 33.3% in the comparison group), dyspeptic (13.1% against 38.8%) as well as pain syndromes (4.3% against 11%) and hepatomegaly (13.1% against 38.8%). The activity of ALT in the main group was in 1.6 times less (p<0,05) than in comparison group at the end of the course of treatment. <<Betargin>> has an antifibrotic effect which is confirmed by a decrease in the level of plasma osteopontin up to 104,92 ng/ml against 178,15 ng/ml in the comparison group (p<0,05).","['Nezgoda, I', 'Moroz, L', 'Singh, Sh', 'Singh, O']","['Nezgoda I', 'Moroz L', 'Singh S', 'Singh O']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Georgia (Republic),Georgian Med News,Georgian medical news,101218222,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2021/01/04 20:06'],"['2021/01/04 20:06 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Georgian Med News. 2020 Nov;(308):71-79.,20210106,,"['National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya, Ukraine.', 'National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya, Ukraine.', 'National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya, Ukraine.', 'National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya, Ukraine.']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']","['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics', '*Hepatitis B, Chronic/drug therapy', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anecdotal experience has suggested that methylene blue (MB) oral rinse may be an effective and safe treatment of this oral pain. METHODS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of MB oral rinse for the treatment of oral pain due to mucositis in patients with cancer, we retrospectively evaluated patients who experienced refractory pain despite conventional therapy. RESULTS: We identified 281 patients who received MB oral rinse. Most were receiving treatment for leukemia (n=85; 30.3%) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=84; 29.9%). The most common treatments were radiation therapy alone (n=108; 38.4%) and chemoradiation (n=86; 30.6%). Median duration of symptoms was 14 days. Mean (SD) numeric rating scale pain scores were 7.7 (1.83; median, 8) before MB oral rinse and 2.51 (2.76; median, 2) after MB oral rinse (P<.0001). Most patients achieved pain control within the first 3 doses. The effectiveness of MB oral rinse was independent of patient age, sex, cancer type, cancer stage, MB dilution, and pain duration or baseline pain scores. The lowest response to treatment was reported in individuals with esophageal mucositis. Few patients experienced adverse effects of MB oral rinse (n=13; 4.6%); 10 had a transient burning sensation, 2 had transient blue discoloration of the teeth and mouth, and 1 had increased pain. CONCLUSIONS: MB oral rinse is an effective and safe treatment for refractory pain from oral mucositis related to cancer treatment.","['Roldan, Carlos J', 'Chung, Matthew', 'Feng, Lei', 'Bruera, Eduardo']","['Roldan CJ', 'Chung M', 'Feng L', 'Bruera E']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210104,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/01/04 20:06'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 20:06 [entrez]']","['10.6004/jnccn.2020.7651 [doi]', 'jnccn20376 [pii]']",epublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2021 Jan 4;19(5):521-527. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2020.7651.

Despite ongoing efforts to use targeted treatments, there remain no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications specifically for children with Ras pathway-mutated leukemia. This review will summarize the role of Ras pathway mutations in pediatric leukemia, discuss the current state of Ras pathway inhibitors and highlight the most promising agents currently being evaluated in clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS: Efficacy using RAF and MEK inhibitors has been demonstrated across multiple solid and brain tumors, and these are now considered standard-of-care for certain tumor types in adults and children. Clinical trials are now testing these medications for the first time in pediatric hematologic disorders, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and histiocytic disorders. Novel inhibitors of the Ras pathway, including direct RAS inhibitors, are also being tested in clinical trials across a spectrum of pediatric and adult malignancies. SUMMARY: Activation of the Ras pathway is a common finding in pediatric hematologic neoplasms. Implementation of precision medicine with a goal of improving outcomes for these patients will require testing of Ras pathway inhibitors in combination with other drugs in the context of current and future clinical trials.","['Pikman, Yana', 'Stieglitz, Elliot']","['Pikman Y', 'Stieglitz E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201229,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2021/01/04 16:08'],"['2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/04 16:08 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000981 [doi]', '00008480-202102000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2021 Feb 1;33(1):49-58. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000981.

In this review, barriers to the diagnosis and management of patients are outlined. RECENT FINDINGS: Increasingly, individuals are being recognized as having germline predisposition to hematopoietic malignancies. Clinical testing for these syndromes is difficult for most clinicians given the need to send true germline samples and the lack of standardization in the field with regard to which genes are covered and the types of DNA changes detected. Additional barriers such as insurance coverage, especially for older individuals, and access to clinical experts need to be overcome in the future. SUMMARY: New research addressing whether use of hematopoietic stem cells with deleterious variants are permissive to transplantation; effective means of delivering genetic counseling and results disclosure to decrease the psychological impact of these diagnoses; and a comprehensive list of all predisposition genes will advance our ability to provide the best treatment possible for our patients and facilitate strategies to maintain excellent health throughout their lifetimes and for members of younger generations.

The prevalence of CH continuously increases with age reaching double-digit percentages in individuals >60 years. CH is associated with an increased risk for hematologic neoplasms and cardiovascular disease. We will review recent efforts to investigate how CH influences patient outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation - both autologous (ASCT) and allogeneic (allo-HSCT). RECENT FINDINGS: Donor-engrafted CH is common in allo-HSCT recipients. Apart from a higher incidence of chronic GvHD and the rare but devastating complication of donor-derived leukemia, CH does not appear to negatively impact outcomes in allo-HSCT recipients. In lymphoma patients undergoing ASCT, however, CH is associated with an excess mortality driven by therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and cardiovascular events. Interestingly, inferior overall survival in patients with CH undergoing ASCT for multiple myeloma (MM) is due to an increased rate of MM progression. SUMMARY: CH is highly prevalent in both allo-HSCT and ASCT patients suggesting a clinically relevant but context-dependent impact on adverse outcomes. Given the current lack of therapeutic interventions, systematic screening for CH in the transplant setting is currently not indicated outside of clinical studies.","['Wilk, C Matthias', 'Manz, Markus G', 'Boettcher, Steffen']","['Wilk CM', 'Manz MG', 'Boettcher S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/01/04 16:08'],"['2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 16:08 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000631 [doi]', '00062752-202103000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2021 Mar 1;28(2):94-100. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000631.,20210810,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, the application of modern agents has renewed interest and the recent data from randomized trials has provided evidence for the use of maintenance therapy in certain populations of AML patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Unselected patients are unlikely to benefit from maintenance therapy as has been previously and consistently demonstrated. The increasing availability of newer and targeted agents like oral hypomethylating agents, protein modifiers, as well as FLT3, IDH1/2 BCL-2 and immune checkpoint inhibitors have restoked interest in maintenance therapy for which randomized, placebo-controlled trials have recently demonstrated benefits, including in the post-transplant setting. Patients with high-risk disease, suboptimal consolidation or remission associated with measurable residual disease (MRD) appear to be beneficiaries of this strategy. The influence of MRD status and the platform by which it is measured are important factors in the current understanding of when maintenance therapy works and how future studies should be designed. SUMMARY: The recent positive findings in support of maintenance therapy for certain AML patient populations are practice changing and bolster the need for properly designed, randomized studies using unified and standardized MRD techniques.","['Shallis, Rory M', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai A']","['Shallis RM', 'Podoltsev NA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/01/04 16:08'],"['2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 16:08 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000637 [doi]', '00062752-202103000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2021 Mar 1;28(2):110-121. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000637.,20210810,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although TAM regresses spontaneously in most patients, approximately 20% of TAM cases result in early death, and approximately 20% of survivors develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). We retrospectively reviewed records of 35 DS patients with TAM to determine the correlation between clinical characteristics and blast percentage. Thirteen of the 35 patients were classified as low blast percentage TAM (LBP-TAM), defined as TAM with a peak peripheral blast percentage </= 10%. Although no patient with LBP-TAM experienced systemic edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or early death, eight patients had elevated direct bilirubin levels (> 2 mg/dl) and one developed AMKL. All patients with LBP-TAM had serum markers of liver fibrosis that exceeded the normal limits, and two patients underwent liver biopsy to clarify the etiology of pathological jaundice.

Leukemic optic disc infiltration, often a clinical diagnosis, can present as an isolated finding in primary or relapsed CNS disease and therefore requires early recognition. Not previously well appreciated, we report here signs of intraocular inflammation accompanying leukemic optic disc infiltration, suggesting infectious or non-infectious uveitis as an alternative diagnosis. We describe a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) sign favoring leukemic infiltration. METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series of all leukemic patients with disc edema (5 patients, 6 eyes) presenting to the University of Michigan's Ocular Oncology Clinic between October 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: We report five leukemic patients (6 eyes) who were evaluated for disc edema and vitritis and eventually diagnosed with leukemic papillopathy. All five patients initially had a bland lumbar puncture (LP), and all four patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had no retrobulbar nerve involvement. Clinical findings included preserved visual acuity (n = 5 eyes, 83%), anterior chamber (AC) cell (n = 3 eyes, 50%), vitreous cell (n = 6 eyes, 100%), and retinal whitening (n = 4 eyes, 66%). In five eyes (83%), a diagnosis of infectious or non-infectious uveitis was initially considered. The OCT finding of inner retinal thickening and loss of inner retinal lamination with largely preserved outer retinal architecture helped point towards a leukemic infiltrative process emanating from the disc and spreading retrograde through the nerve fiber layer. CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight the difficulty of distinguishing intraocular inflammation associated with leukemic papillopathy from infectious or non-infectious uveitis, especially considering bland LP and negative retrobulbar MRI signal in all our patients. We propose juxtapapillary inner retinal infiltration with the loss of inner retinal lamination and relative preservation of outer retinal architecture on OCT imaging as a finding that supports the diagnosis of leukemic papillopathy.","['Miller, Jason M L', 'Chang, Emily', 'Besirli, Cagri G', 'Johnson, Mark W', 'Demirci, Hakan']","['Miller JML', 'Chang E', 'Besirli CG', 'Johnson MW', 'Demirci H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2784-9560', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9266-7627', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7154-2024', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9720-8761', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1593-1476']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210104,Germany,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,8205248,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Infectious uveitis', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemic papillopathy', 'Non-infectious uveitis', 'Optic neuropathy', 'Optical coherence tomography (OCT)']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2021/01/04 12:15'],"['2020/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 12:15 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00417-020-05055-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00417-020-05055-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2021 May;259(5):1315-1322. doi: 10.1007/s00417-020-05055-2.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Malignancy reseeding in cryopreserved ovarian tissue from 20 patients with CNS tumours was not detected by histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), molecular biology or xenotransplantation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Ovarian metastasis potential has been documented in patients with leukaemia, borderline ovarian tumours, advanced breast cancer and Ewing sarcoma. However, data on the safety of transplanting frozen-thawed ovarian tissue from cancer patients with CNS tumours are still lacking. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective experimental study was conducted in an academic gynaecology research laboratory using cryopreserved ovarian cortex from 20 patients suffering from CNS tumours. Long-term (5 months) xenografting was performed in immunodeficient mice. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Subjects enrolled in the study were suffering from one of six types of CNS tumours including medulloblastoma, ependymoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumours, astrocytoma, glioblastoma and germinoma. The presence of malignant cells was investigated with disease-specific markers for each patient in cryopreserved and xenografted ovarian tissue by histology, IHC via expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) for quantification of GFAP and ENO2 gene amplification. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Serial sections of cryopreserved and xenografted ovarian tissue from 20 patients showed no malignant cells by histology. All samples were negative for NSE and GFAP, although these neural markers were expressed extensively in the patients' primary tumours. Analysis by RT-ddPCR revealed no cancer cells detected in cryopreserved and xenografted ovarian fragments from subjects with astrocytoma, ependymoma, glioblastoma or medulloblastoma. Taken together, the study found no evidence of malignancy seeding in frozen-thawed and xenotransplanted ovarian tissue from patients affected by CNS cancers. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This analysis cannot guarantee complete elimination of disseminated disease from all cryopreserved ovarian cortex, since we are unable to examine the fragments used for transplantation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first study to be conducted in patients with CNS cancers undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation, and clearly demonstrates no tumour seeding in their frozen-thawed and xenografted tissue. This information is vital for doctors to provide patients with meaningful and accurate advice on the possibilities and risks of ovarian tissue reimplantation.

Although its detection by flow cytometry (FC) and real-time quantitative polymerase has clinical usefulness, evidence suggests that methods with increased sensitivity could lead to improved outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop an amplicon-based assay followed by high-throughput sequencing of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region for MRD detection in B-ALL. METHODS: We analyzed 84 samples, 27 from diagnosis, 5 from relapse, 40 from post-treatment samples, and 12 from healthy controls. RESULTS: Our assay was able to identify more neoplastic clones at diagnosis than Sanger sequencing including incomplete DJ rearrangements. From the 40 MRD samples evaluated 21 were positive by our new approach on high-throughput sequencing assay, but only 15 of these were positive by FC. The remaining 19 were negative by the two techniques. CONCLUSION: We have developed a novel approach on high-sensitive assay for MRD detection in B-ALL, which could add clinical value in the management of patients, especially in cases negative for MRD by FC.","['Correia, Rodolfo P', 'Puga, Renato D', 'Muto, Nair H', 'Lee, Maria Lucia de M', 'Torres, Davi C', 'Hassan, Rocio', 'Bacal, Nydia S', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Campregher, Paulo V']","['Correia RP', 'Puga RD', 'Muto NH', 'Lee MLM', 'Torres DC', 'Hassan R', 'Bacal NS', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Campregher PV']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4117-5988'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210104,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphoblastic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'high-throughput sequencing', 'minimal residual disease', 'real-time quantitative polymerase']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2021/01/04 09:23'],"['2020/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 09:23 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13453 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Aug;43(4):724-731. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13453.

Although children with DS are predisposed to developing leukemia, especially B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the HSA21 genes that contribute to malignancies remain largely undefined. Here, we report that DYRK1A is overexpressed and required for B-ALL. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of DYRK1A decreased leukemic cell expansion and suppressed B-ALL development in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that FOXO1 and STAT3, transcription factors that are indispensable for B cell development, are critical substrates of DYRK1A. Loss of DYRK1A-mediated FOXO1 and STAT3 signaling disrupted DNA damage and ROS regulation, respectively, leading to preferential cell death in leukemic B cells. Thus, we reveal a DYRK1A/FOXO1/STAT3 axis that facilitates the development and maintenance of B-ALL.","['Bhansali, Rahul S', 'Rammohan, Malini', 'Lee, Paul', 'Laurent, Anouchka P', 'Wen, Qiang', 'Suraneni, Praveen', 'Yip, Bon Ham', 'Tsai, Yi-Chien', 'Jenni, Silvia', 'Bornhauser, Beat', 'Siret, Aurelie', 'Fruit, Corinne', 'Pacheco-Benichou, Alexandra', 'Harris, Ethan', 'Besson, Thierry', 'Thompson, Benjamin J', 'Goo, Young Ah', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Vilenchik, Maria', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Malinge, Sebastien', 'Crispino, John D']","['Bhansali RS', 'Rammohan M', 'Lee P', 'Laurent AP', 'Wen Q', 'Suraneni P', 'Yip BH', 'Tsai YC', 'Jenni S', 'Bornhauser B', 'Siret A', 'Fruit C', 'Pacheco-Benichou A', 'Harris E', 'Besson T', 'Thompson BJ', 'Goo YA', 'Hijiya N', 'Vilenchik M', 'Izraeli S', 'Bourquin JP', 'Malinge S', 'Crispino JD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/09/09 06:00,['2021/01/04 09:20'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 09:20 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['135937 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI135937 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Jan 4;131(1). pii: 135937. doi: 10.1172/JCI135937.,20210908,,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Abbvie, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Normandie University, UNIROUEN, Institut National des Sciences Appliquees (INSA) Rouen, CNRS, Chimie Organique et Bioorganique -

The study revealed a DYRK1A/FOXO1 and STAT3 signaling pathway in B-ALL that could be targeted pharmacologically, thus opening the door to therapeutic strategies for patients with leukemia with or without DS.","['Kim, Jung-Hyun', 'Li, Liping', 'Resar, Linda Ms']","['Kim JH', 'Li L', 'Resar LM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/08/26 06:00,['2021/01/04 09:20'],"['2021/01/04 09:20 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['142627 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI142627 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Jan 4;131(1). pii: 142627. doi: 10.1172/JCI142627.,20210825,,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology.', 'Departments of Oncology and Pathology, and Institute of Cellular Engineering, and.', 'Pathobiology, Human Genetics, and Cellular and Molecular Medicine Graduate Programs, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']","['42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']","['B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Tyrosine']",,,"['R01 CA232741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK102943/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL143818/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL145780/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7773367,['J Clin Invest. 2021 Jan 4;131(1):.

Xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) plays a key role in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which may modulate individual susceptibility to developing cancer. We hypothesized links between XPG variants and glioma in children.Methods: We tested our hypothesis in a study comparing 171 glioma cases with 228 age and sex matched controls, determining XPG polymorphisms rs2094258 C > T, rs751402 C > T, rs2296147 T > C, rs1047768 T > C, rs873601 G > A by standard molecular genetic methods.Results: rs2094258 C > T was associated with a decreased glioma risk, but carrying the rs1047768 C or rs873601 A allele brought an increased risk. Subjects carrying 5 risk genotypes had a significantly increased glioma risk at an adjusted odds ratio of 1.97 (95% confidence Interval 1.26-3.08)(p = 0.003) when compared with those carrying 0-4 risk genotypes. Furthermore, children with 5 risk genotypes had a higher glioma risk when aged >60 months, were more likely to be male, and with subtypes of astrocytic tumours, and low-grade clinical stage, when compared to those with 0-4 risk genotypes. Preliminary functional exploration suggested that rs2094258 is linked with the expression of its surrounding genes in the expression quantitative trait locus analysis.Conclusion: Certain variants of XPG are risk factors for paediatric glioma, and so may be useful in early diagnosis.","['Yuan, L', 'Hu, W M', 'Chen, K', 'Shi, Q', 'Lin, A', 'Chen, H T', 'Zhuo, Z J', 'Zeng, L']","['Yuan L', 'Hu WM', 'Chen K', 'Shi Q', 'Lin A', 'Chen HT', 'Zhuo ZJ', 'Zeng L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0142-4086'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20210205,England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chinese', 'SNP', 'XPG', 'glioma', 'susceptibility']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/01/04 08:50'],"['2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 08:50 [entrez]']","['10.1080/09674845.2020.1870308 [doi]', '10.1080/09674845.2020.1870308 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 2021 Jul;78(3):135-140. doi: 10.1080/09674845.2020.1870308.

Overexpression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is associated with up to 70% of AML patients. Wild-type FLT3 induces proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in AML cells, while uncontrolled proliferation of FLT3 kinase activity is also associated with FLT3 mutations. Therefore, inhibiting FLT3 activity is a promising AML therapy. Flavonoids are a group of phytochemicals that can target protein kinases, suggesting their potential antitumor activities. In this study, several plant-derived flavonoids have been identified with FLT3 inhibitory activity. Among these compounds, compound 40 (5,7,4'-trihydroxy-6-methoxyflavone) exhibited the most potent inhibition against not only FLT3 (IC50 = 0.44 muM) but also FLT3-D835Y and FLT3-ITD mutants (IC50 = 0.23 and 0.39 muM, respectively). The critical interactions between the FLT3 binding site and the compounds were identified by performing a structure-activity relationship analysis. Furthermore, the results of cellular assays revealed that compounds 28, 31, 32, and 40 exhibited significant cytotoxicity against two human AML cell lines (MOLM-13 and MV-4-11), and compounds 31, 32, and 40 resulted in cell apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these flavonoids have the potential to be further optimized as FLT3 inhibitors and provide valuable chemical information for the development of new AML drugs.","['Yen, Shih-Chung', 'Chen, Liang-Chieh', 'Huang, Han-Li', 'Ngo, Sin-Ting', 'Wu, Yi-Wen', 'Lin, Tony Eight', 'Sung, Tzu-Ying', 'Lien, Ssu-Ting', 'Tseng, Hui-Ju', 'Pan, Shiow-Lin', 'Huang, Wei-Jan', 'Hsu, Kai-Cheng']","['Yen SC', 'Chen LC', 'Huang HL', 'Ngo ST', 'Wu YW', 'Lin TE', 'Sung TY', 'Lien ST', 'Tseng HJ', 'Pan SL', 'Huang WJ', 'Hsu KC']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4891-3848', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9022-6673']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210103,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,IM,,,2021/01/05 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/01/04 08:49'],"['2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 08:49 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00589 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2021 Jan 22;84(1):1-10. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00589.

Relapse and chemoresistance result in treatment failure, underlining the need for improved therapies. BTB and CNC homology 2 (BACH2) is a lymphoid-specific transcription repressor recognized as a tumor suppressor in lymphomas, but little is known about its function and regulatory network in pediatric ALL (p-ALL). Herein, we found aberrant BACH2 expression at new diagnosis not only facilitated risk stratification of p-ALL but also served as a sensitive predictor of early treatment response and clinical outcome. Silencing BACH2 in ALL cells increased cell proliferation and accelerated cell cycle progression. BACH2 blockade also promoted cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells and conferred cytarabine (Ara-C)-resistant properties to leukemia cells by altering stromal microenvironment. Strikingly, we identified FOS, a transcriptional activator competing with BACH2, as a novel downstream target repressed by BACH2. Blocking FOS by chemical compounds enhanced the effect of Ara-C treatment in both primary p-ALL cells and pre-B-ALL-driven leukemia xenografts and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. These data highlight an interconnected network of BACH2-FOS, disruption of which could render current chemotherapies more effective and offer a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome Ara-C resistance in p-ALL.","['Zhang, Han', 'Zhang, Ruidong', 'Zheng, Xueling', 'Sun, Ming', 'Fan, Jia', 'Fang, Chunlian', 'Tian, Xin', 'Zheng, Huyong']","['Zhang H', 'Zhang R', 'Zheng X', 'Sun M', 'Fan J', 'Fang C', 'Tian X', 'Zheng H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2684-512X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20210122,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BACH2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'childhood', 'cytarabine']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2021/01/04 05:36'],"['2020/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 05:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14792 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Mar;112(3):1235-1250. doi: 10.1111/cas.14792.

Studies have shown that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) can contribute to various vascular diseases. We investigated the effects of TKIs on the development of EndMT in human vascular-endothelial cells (VECs). Exposure of VECs to dasatinib, but not to other TKIs, produced a significant increase in the formation of spindle-shaped cells. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in expression of the EndMT inducer transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and mesenchymal markers vimentin, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and fibronectin, as well as a significant decrease in expression of vascular-endothelial markers CD31 and VE-cadherin attributable at least in part to activation of ERK signaling. Inhibitors of TGF-beta and ERK partially attenuated dasatinib-induced EndMT. Interestingly, bosutinib efficiently counteracted dasatinib-induced EndMT and attenuated dasatinib-induced phosphorylation of ERK. Taken together, these results show that dasatinib induces EndMT, which might contribute to the development of vascular toxicity, such as the pulmonary hypertension observed in CML patients receiving dasatinib. Bosutinib could play a distinct role in protecting VECs from EndMT.","['Alkebsi, Lobna', 'Wang, Xintao', 'Ohkawara, Hiroshi', 'Fukatsu, Masahiko', 'Mori, Hirotaka', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki']","['Alkebsi L', 'Wang X', 'Ohkawara H', 'Fukatsu M', 'Mori H', 'Ikezoe T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0689-4717'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210103,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'Dasatinib', 'EndMT', 'TKIs', 'Vascular endothelial cells']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2021/01/04 05:35'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 05:35 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-03034-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-03034-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Mar;113(3):441-455. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-03034-1.

Recent studies have shown that the E69K mutation was fairly sensitive to the allosteric inhibitor of SHP2 (SHP099). However, the molecular mechanism of the allosteric drug SHP099 inhibiting SHP2(E69K) remains unclear. Thus, the molecular dynamic simulations and the post-dynamics analyses (RMSF, PCA, DCCM, RIN and the binding free energies) for SHP2(WT), SHP2(WT)-SHP099, SHP2(E69K) and SHP2(E69K)-SHP099 were carried out, respectively. Owing to the strong binding affinity of SHP099 to residues Thr219 and Arg220, the flexibility of linker region (residues Val209-Arg231) was reduced. Moreover, the presence of SHP099 kept the autoinhibition state of the SHP2 protein through enhancing the interactions between the linker region and Q loop in PTP domain, such as Thr219/Val490, Thr219/Asn491, Arg220/Ile488 and Leu254/Asn491. In addition, it was found that the residues (Thr219, Arg220, Leu254 and Asn491) might be the key residues responsible for the conformational changes of protein. Overall, this study may provide an important basis for understanding how the SHP099 effectively inhibited the SHP2(E69K) activity at the molecular level.","['Du, Shan', 'Lu, Xin-Hua', 'Li, Wei-Ya', 'Li, Li-Peng', 'Ma, Yang-Chun', 'Zhou, Liang', 'Wu, Jing-Wei', 'Ma, Ying', 'Wang, Run-Ling']","['Du S', 'Lu XH', 'Li WY', 'Li LP', 'Ma YC', 'Zhou L', 'Wu JW', 'Ma Y', 'Wang RL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210103,Netherlands,Mol Divers,Molecular diversity,9516534,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Allosteric inhibitor SHP099', 'E69K mutation', 'Molecular dynamic simulation', 'Post-dynamics analyses', 'Protein tyrosine phosphatase-2']",2021/01/05 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2021/01/04 05:35'],"['2020/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 05:35 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11030-020-10179-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11030-020-10179-y [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Divers. 2021 Aug;25(3):1873-1887. doi: 10.1007/s11030-020-10179-y.

High risk was defined by the presence of at least del(17p), t(4;14), and/or t(14;16). 1p/1q detection (in the standard FISH panel from 2012 onward) was not available for all patients. We analyzed 139 MM/PCL diagnostic samples from 144 patients, with a median follow-up of 71 months: high-risk CA at diagnosis (MGUS/SMM or NDMM) was present in 28% of samples, whereas 37-39% showed high-risk CA at relapse. In 115 patients with NDMM who evolved to relapsed/refractory MM, we identified 3 different populations: (1) 31/115 patients (27%) with gain of new CA (del13, del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16) or 1q CA when available); (2) 10/115 (9%) patients with loss of a previously identified CA; and (3) 74 patients with no changes. The CA gain group showed a median overall survival of 66 months vs. 84 months in the third group (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.92, p = 0.023). Clonal evolution occurs as disease progresses after different chemotherapy lines. Patients who acquired high-risk CA had the poorest prognosis.

The TdT is expressed in high-grade B-cell lymphoma; therefore, it poses a classification and management dilemma, which should be accurately differentiated from B-cell ALL and mandates molecular analysis.

The disease is often accompanied by splenomegaly, but no developmental abnormalities and significant reticular fibrosis, and no Ph chromosome and BCR-ABL fusion gene. So, it is difficult to diagnose at the first presentation in the absence of classical symptoms. Herein we describe a rare CNL patient without splenomegaly whose initial diagnostic clue was neutrophilic hyperactivity. CASE SUMMARY: The patient is an 80-year-old Han Chinese man who presented with one month of fatigue and fatigue aggravation in the last half of the month. He had no splenomegaly, but had persistent hypofibrinogenemia, obvious skin bleeding, and hemoptysis, and required repeated infusion of fibrinogen therapy. After many relevant laboratory examinations, histopathological examination, and sequencing analysis, the patient was finally diagnosed with CNL [CSF3R T618I positive: c.1853C>T (p.T618I) and c.2514T>A (p.C838)]. CONCLUSION: The physical examination and blood test for tumor-related genes are insufficient to establish a diagnosis of CNL. Splenomegaly is not that important, but hyperplasia of interstitial neutrophil system and activating mutations in CSF3R are important clues to CNL diagnosis.","['Li, Ya-Ping', 'Chen, Na', 'Ye, Xian-Mei', 'Xia, Yong-Shou']","['Li YP', 'Chen N', 'Ye XM', 'Xia YS']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allopurinol', 'CSF3R', 'Case report', 'Chronic neutrophilic leukemia', 'Hydroxyurea', 'Hyperplasia of interstitial neutrophil system', 'Leukemia']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/01/05 06:01,['2021/01/04 05:31'],"['2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 05:31 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v8.i24.6337 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2020 Dec 26;8(24):6337-6345. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v8.i24.6337.,,"['(c)The Author(s) 2020.

ASNase products available in the market are produced by bacteria and usually present allergic response and important toxicity effects to the patients. Production of ASNase by yeasts could be an alternative to overcome these problems since yeasts have better compatibility with the human system. Recently, it was found that Leucosporidium scottii, a psychrotolerant yeast, produces ASNase. In order to advance the production of ASNase by this yeast, the present study aimed to select suitable process conditions able to maximize the production of this enzyme in a bench-scale bioreactor. Additionally, the accumulation of lipids during the enzyme production process was also determined and quantified. Experiments were carried out with the aim of selecting the most appropriate conditions of initial cell concentration (1.0, 3.5, and 5.6 g L(-1)), carbon source (sucrose and glycerol, individually or in mixture) and oxygen transfer rate (k L a in the range of 1.42-123 h(-1)) to be used on the production of ASNase by this yeast. Results revealed that the enzyme production increased when using an initial cell concentration of 5.6 g L(-1), mixture of sucrose and glycerol as carbon source, and k L a of 91.72 h(-1). Under these conditions, the enzyme productivity was maximized, reaching 35.11 U L(-1) h(-1), which is already suitable for the development of scale-up studies. Additionally, accumulation of lipids was observed in all the cultivations, corresponding to 2-7 g L(-1) (32-40% of the cell dry mass), with oleic acid (C18 : 1) being the predominant compound (50.15%). Since the L-asparaginase biopharmaceuticals on the market are highly priced, the co-production of lipids as a secondary high-value product during the ASNase production, as observed in the present study, is an interesting finding that opens up perspectives to increase the economic feasibility of the enzyme production process.","['Moguel, Ignacio S', 'Yamakawa, Celina K', 'Pessoa, Adalberto Jr', 'Mussatto, Solange I']","['Moguel IS', 'Yamakawa CK', 'Pessoa A Jr', 'Mussatto SI']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201217,Switzerland,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,101632513,,['NOTNLM'],"['L-asparaginase', 'bioreactor', 'lipid accumulation', 'oleaginous yeast', 'process optimization']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/01/05 06:01,['2021/01/04 05:30'],"['2020/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 05:30 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fbioe.2020.576511 [doi]'],epublish,Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2020 Dec 17;8:576511. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2020.576511. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Moguel, Yamakawa, Pessoa and Mussatto.']","['Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7773903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that the tissue microenvironment promotes proliferation and drug resistance of leukemic cells suggesting that successful treatments of B cell malignancies must target the leukemic cells within these compartments. However, the cross-talk occurring between cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment still needs to be fully elucidated. In solid tumors, this lack of knowledge has led to the development of new and more complex in vitro models able to successfully mimic the in vivo settings, while only a few simplified models are available for haematological cancers, commonly relying only on the co-culture with stabilized stromal cells and/or the addition of limited cocktails of cytokines. Here, we will review the known cellular and molecular interactions occurring between monoclonal B lymphocytes and their tissue microenvironment and the current literature describing innovative in vitro models developed in particular to study chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We will also elaborate on the possibility to further improve such systems based on the current knowledge of the key molecules/signals present in the microenvironment. In particular, we think that future models should be developed as 3D culture systems with a higher level of cellular and molecular complexity, to replicate microenvironmental-induced signaling. We believe that innovative 3D-models may therefore improve the knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms leading to the dissemination and homing of leukemia cells and consequently the identification of therapeutic targets.","['Scielzo, Cristina', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Scielzo C', 'Ghia P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201217,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['3D models (three dimensional)', 'B cell malignancies', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'in vitro', 'microenvironment']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/01/05 06:01,['2021/01/04 05:30'],"['2020/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 05:30 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.607608 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 17;10:607608. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.607608. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Scielzo and Ghia.'],"['Unit of Malignant B Cell Biology and 3D Modeling, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of B Cell Neoplasia, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

Prognostic analysis in B-CLL is routinely carried out to assist patient management; particularly to predict the time to initiate treatment. Increased ZAP-70 expression is a surrogate marker for unmutated immunoglobulin genes and inferior clinical outcomes which can be quantified to predict future outcomes in B-CLL patients. The study determined the ZAP-70 expression pattern using Z-index in Pakistani patients with B-CLL. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of B-CLL cases diagnosed and confirmed on flow cytometry at Aga Khan University Hospital for the last six years which had also undergone ZAP-70 analysis were included. In all these cases, ZAP-70 expression was quantified by measuring mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of normal B-cells, T-cells, and CLL-cells (CD19 and CD5 double-positive population). ZAP-70 expression was divided into high, low, and negative categories based on Z-index calculation. Mann-Whitney U test was utilized to determine the significance of ZAP-70 variations in different age groups and genders. P-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients of B-CLL had ZAP-70 analysis during the study period. The median age was 62 with an interquartile range of 35-87 and male to female ratio of 2:1. ZAP-70 expression was high in 18 (15%), low in 52 (43.3%) and negative in 50 (41.7%) cases. No significant difference in ZAP-70 expression with respect to the age or gender of the study population was identified using appropriate statistical calculations. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed only 15% of B-CLL cases showing high ZAP-70 expression, a surrogate biomarker for possible aggressive behavior which may necessitate therapeutic intervention and close surveillance.","['Shaikh, Muhammad Shariq', 'Ahmed, Arsalan', 'Sohail, Summaiya', 'Fahim, Amin', 'Nohario, Sadiq Hussain', 'Pervez, Shahid']","['Shaikh MS', 'Ahmed A', 'Sohail S', 'Fahim A', 'Nohario SH', 'Pervez S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201124,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (b-cll)', 'flow cytometry', 'pakistan', 'zap-70']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/01/05 06:01,['2021/01/04 05:29'],"['2021/01/04 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.11691 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Nov 24;12(11):e11691. doi: 10.7759/cureus.11691.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Shaikh et al.']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', 'Pathology, Isra University, Hyderabad, PAK.', 'Oncology, Nuclear Institute of Medicine and Radiotherapy, Jamshoro, PAK.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, PAK.']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC7769768,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we first summarize the classification and biogenesis of tRFs. tRFs are produced from pre-tRNAs or mature tRNAs. Based on the incision loci, tRFs are classified into several types: tRF-1, tRF-2, tRF-3, tRF-5, and i-tRF. Some tRFs participate in posttranscriptional regulation through microRNA-like actions or by displacing RNA binding proteins and regulating protein translation by promoting ribosome biogenesis or interfering with translation initiation. Other tRFs prevent cell apoptosis by binding to cytochrome c or promoting virus replication. More importantly, the dysregulation of tRFs has important clinical implications. They are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of gastric cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. tRFs may become new therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and respiratory syncytial virus infection. Finally, we point out the existing problems and future research directions associated with tRFs. In conclusion, the current progress in the research of tRFs reveals that they have important clinical implications and may constitute novel molecular therapeutic targets for modulating pathological processes.","['Yu, Xiuchong', 'Xie, Yaoyao', 'Zhang, Shuangshuang', 'Song, Xuemei', 'Xiao, Bingxiu', 'Yan, Zhilong']","['Yu X', 'Xie Y', 'Zhang S', 'Song X', 'Xiao B', 'Yan Z']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210101,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*mechanism', '*tRNA-derived fragment (tRF)', '*therapeutic strategy', '*virus infection']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/01/04 05:28'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 05:28 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.51963 [doi]', 'thnov11p0461 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2021 Jan 1;11(1):461-469. doi: 10.7150/thno.51963. eCollection 2021.,20210805,['(c) The author(s).'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315010, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315010, China.']","['0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Small Untranslated)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']","['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Stability/genetics', 'RNA, Small Untranslated/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Diseases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,PMC7681095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient-related factors determining the outcome in SM are largely unknown. Methods: We examined the impact of sex on the clinical features, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in 3403 patients with mastocytosis collected in the registry of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM). The impact of cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations on sex differences was analyzed in a subset of patients. Results: Of all patients enrolled, 55.3% were females. However, a male predominance was found in a subset of advanced SM (AdvSM) patients, namely SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN, 70%; p < 0.001). Correspondingly, organomegaly (male: 23% vs. female: 13%, p = 0.007) was more, whereas skin involvement (male: 71% vs. female: 86%, p = 0.001) was less frequent in males. In all patients together, OS (p < 0.0001) was significantly inferior in males, and also within the WHO sub-categories indolent SM, aggressive SM (ASM) and SM-AHN. PFS was significantly (p = 0.0002) worse in males when all patients were grouped together; due to low numbers of events, this significance persisted only in the subcategory smoldering SM. Finally, prognostically relevant cytogenetic abnormalities (10% vs. 5%, p = 0.006) or molecular aberrations (SRSF2/ASXL1/RUNX1 profile; 63% vs. 40%, p = 0.003) were more frequently present in males. Conclusions: Male sex has a major impact on clinical features, disease progression, and survival in mastocytosis.

Several studies have shown that neoplasia in AML is enhanced by tyrosine kinase pathways. Recently, given that aberrant activation of Fms-like tyrosine receptor kinase 3 (FLT3) acts as a critical survival signal for cancer cells in 2030% patients with AML, inhibition of FLT3 may be a potential therapeutic strategy. Therefore, we identified LT-171-861, a novel kinase inhibitor with remarkable inhibitory activity against FLT3, in preclinical models of AML. Methods: We determined the inhibitory effects of LT-171-861 in vitro using AML cell lines and transformed BaF3 cells. Target engagement assays were used to verify the interaction between LT-171-861 and FLT3. Finally, a subcutaneous model and a bone marrow engrafted model were used to evaluate the antitumor effects of LT171861 in vivo. Results: Our data demonstrated that LT-171-861 had high affinity for FLT3 protein. We also showed that LT-171-861 had an inhibitory effect on FLT3 mutants in cellular assays. Moreover, LT-171-861 had a growth-inhibitory effect on human AML cell lines harboring FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) such as FLT3-D835Y, FLT3ITD-N676D, FLT3-ITD-D835Y, FLT3-ITD-F691L, FLT3-ITD-Y842C and AML blasts from patients with FLT3-ITD. Furthermore, LT-171-861 showed potent antileukemic efficacy against AML cells. We also show the efficacy of LT171-861 in a subcutaneous implantation model and a bone marrow engrafted model in vivo, where administration of LT-171-861 led to almost complete tumor regression and increased survival. Conclusions: Overall, this study not only identifies LT-171-861 as a potent FLT3 inhibitor, but also provides a rationale for the upcoming clinical trial of LT-171-861 in patients with AML and FLT3-ITD mutations.","['Yu, Zhou', 'Du, Jiaying', 'Hui, Hui', 'Kan, Shaoxin', 'Huo, Tongxin', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Wu, Tao', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Lu, Na']","['Yu Z', 'Du J', 'Hui H', 'Kan S', 'Huo T', 'Zhao K', 'Wu T', 'Guo Q', 'Lu N']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210101,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*FLT3', '*ITD', '*inhibitor', '*resistance']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/01/04 05:28'],"['2020/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 05:28 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.46593 [doi]', 'thnov11p0093 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2021 Jan 1;11(1):93-106. doi: 10.7150/thno.46593. eCollection 2021.,20210805,['(c) The author(s).'],"[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (LT-171-861)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/drug effects', 'Female', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Janus Kinases/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects', 'Purines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'THP-1 Cells', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,PMC7681098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One example is lncRNA Deleted in Lymphocytic Leukemia 2 (DLEU2). However, how DLEU2 contributes to CRC is still poorly understood. This study sought to investigate the effects of DLEU2 on CRC pathogenesis, and the underlying mechanism involved. Using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay, we demonstrated that the expression levels of DLEU2 in 45 pairs of CRC tissues were higher than those in the corresponding normal colon mucosal tissues. In addition, CRC patients with high DLEU2 expression levels exhibited poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), as determined by analyses and measurements from the GEO and GEPIA databases. When DLEU2 was silenced using short interfering RNA (siRNA) in CRC cell line, the results demonstrated that DLEU2 silencing suppressed CRC cell tumorigenesis in vitro, which was associated with decreased expression of cyclin dependent kinase 6(CDK6), ZEB1, and ZEB2 as well as enhancing the expression of Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A). Taken together, the results of this study suggested that DLEU2 may play critical roles in the progression of CRC and may serve as a prognostic biomarker for CRC.","['He, Xiaoyun', 'Yu, Bingbing', 'Kuang, Gaoyan', 'Wu, Yongrong', 'Zhang, Meili', 'Cao, Pengfei', 'Ou, Chunlin']","['He X', 'Yu B', 'Kuang G', 'Wu Y', 'Zhang M', 'Cao P', 'Ou C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210101,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,['NOTNLM'],"['DLEU2', 'colorectal cancer', 'invasion', 'survival', 'tumorigenesis']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/01/05 06:01,['2021/01/04 05:27'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 05:27 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.48423 [doi]', 'jcav12p0428 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2021 Jan 1;12(2):428-437. doi: 10.7150/jca.48423. eCollection 2021.,,['(c) The author(s).'],"['Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou 253056, Shandong, China."", 'Department of Orthopedics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410007, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410007, Hunan, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou 253056, Shandong, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, China.']",,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,PMC7738996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of USP1 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains largely undefined. USP1 expression in 30 newly diagnosed B-ALL patients was detected by real-time PCR and western blot. We found that USP1 was generally upregulated in the bone marrow cells derived from B-ALL patients. Knockdown of USP1 by siRNA decreased B-ALL cell growth and induced apoptosis. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of USP1 by SJB3-019A significantly repressed cell proliferation and triggered B-ALL cell apoptosis. Finally, we found that inhibition of USP1 downregulated the expression of ID1 and p-AKT, and upregulated ID1 expression could reverse the suppressive effects of USP1 inhibitor in B-ALL cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that USP1 promote B-ALL progression at least partially via the ID1/AKT signaling pathway, and USP1 inhibitors might be promising therapeutic application for B-ALL.","['Kuang, Xingyi', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Lu, Tingting', 'Wang, Weili', 'Zhang, Zhaoyuan', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Kuang X', 'Xiong J', 'Lu T', 'Wang W', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210101,Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'ID1', 'PI3K/AKT pathway', 'SJB3-019A', 'USP1', 'apoptosis']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2021/01/04 05:25'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 05:25 [entrez]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijms.47597 [doi]', 'ijmsv18p0245 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2021 Jan 1;18(1):245-255. doi: 10.7150/ijms.47597. eCollection 2021.,20210906,['(c) The author(s).'],"['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, P.R.

Preclinical studies demonstrated that gilteritinib inhibited FLT3 and showed antiproliferative activity against Ba/F3 cells expressing mutated FLT3. In addition, gilteritinib inhibited tumor growth, induced tumor regression, and prolonged survival in mice xenografted with MV4-11 cells endogenously expressing FLT3-internal tandem duplication. In clinical trials conducted in the United States, Europe, and Japan, plasma concentrations after administration of gilteritinib 20 to 450 mg/day were generally dose proportional, and gilteritinib was well tolerated. Multiple clinical trials, including a global Phase III study, in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML treated with gilteritinib demonstrated higher response rates of complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery and longer overall survival compared with patients treated with salvage chemotherapy. Some clinical trials are ongoing in patients with FLT3-mutated AML at various treatment stages, such as induction therapy, maintenance therapy, and treatment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Furthermore, subtypes such as Ph-like ALL remain at high-risk of relapse, and treatment resistance remains a significant clinical issue. The patient-derived Ph-like ALL RANBP2-ABL1 fusion gene was transduced into Ba/F3 cells and allowed to become resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib or dasatinib, followed by secondary resistance to ponatinib. RANBP2-ABL1 Ba/F3 cells developed the clinically relevant ABL1 p.T315I mutation and upon secondary resistance to ponatinib, developed compound mutations, including a novel ABL1 p.L302H mutation. Significantly, compound mutations were targetable with a combination of asciminib and ponatinib. In-vitro modeling of Ph-like ALL RANBP2-ABL1 has identified kinase domain mutations in response to TKI treatment, that may have important clinical ramifications. Early detection of mutations is paramount to guide treatment strategies and improve survival in this high-risk group of patients.","['Heatley, Susan L', 'Asari, Kartini', 'Schutz, Caitlin E', 'Leclercq, Tamara M', 'McClure, Barbara J', 'Eadie, Laura N', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Yeung, David T', 'White, Deborah L']","['Heatley SL', 'Asari K', 'Schutz CE', 'Leclercq TM', 'McClure BJ', 'Eadie LN', 'Hughes TP', 'Yeung DT', 'White DL']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7497-6477', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5201-4127', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1912-7602', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0910-3730', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4844-333X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210102,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABL-class fusions', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Ph-like ALL', '*TKI resistance', '*asciminib']",2021/01/05 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2021/01/04 05:19'],"['2021/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/04 05:19 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1861275 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 May;62(5):1157-1166. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1861275.

It is approved as an antispasmodic drug by the US FDA and is also reported to have anti-cancer properties. Here, Papaverine's activity in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is explored using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mammalian cancer cell lines, and in silico studies. METHODS: The sensitivity of wild-type and mutant (anti-oxidant defense, apoptosis) strains of S. cerevisiae to the drug Papaverine was tested by colony formation, spot assays, and AO/EB staining. In vitro cytotoxic effect was investigated on HCT15 (colon), A549 (lung), HeLa (cervical), and K562 (Bcr-Abl positive CML), and RAW 264.7 cell lines; cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS detection analyzed in K562 cells using flow cytometry and apoptotic markers, Bcr-Abl signaling pathways examined by western blotting. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation of Papaverine against the target Bcr-Abl were also carried out. RESULTS: Investigation in S. cerevisiae evidenced Papaverine induces ROS-mediated apoptosis. Subsequent in vitro examination showed that CML cell line K562 was more sensitive to the drug Papaverine. Papaverine induces ROS generation, promotes apoptosis, and inhibits Bcr-Abl downstream signaling. Papaverine acts synergistically with the drug Imatinib. Furthermore, the docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies supported that Papaverine binds to the allosteric site of Bcr-Abl. CONCLUSION: The data presented here have added support to the concept of polypharmacology of existing drugs and natural compounds to interact with more than one target. This study provides a proof-of-concept for repositioning Papaverine as an anti-CML drug.","['Parcha, Phani Krishna', 'Sarvagalla, Sailu', 'Ashok, Cheemala', 'Sudharshan, S J', 'Dyavaiah, Madhu', 'Coumar, Mohane Selvaraj', 'Rajasekaran, Baskaran']","['Parcha PK', 'Sarvagalla S', 'Ashok C', 'Sudharshan SJ', 'Dyavaiah M', 'Coumar MS', 'Rajasekaran B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0505-568X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210103,Switzerland,Pharmacol Rep,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-abl', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Docking', 'Drug repositioning', 'K562', 'Papaverine', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",2021/01/04 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/01/03 20:42'],"['2020/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/03 20:42 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s43440-020-00196-x [doi]', '10.1007/s43440-020-00196-x [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rep. 2021 Apr;73(2):615-628. doi: 10.1007/s43440-020-00196-x.

Early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) by bronchoscopy is recommended but is often difficult to perform because of small lesion size and bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia. A 71-year-old woman had received initial induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. On day 22 of chemotherapy, she had a high fever, and the chest computed tomography scan revealed a 20-mm-sized nodule with a halo sign. Bronchoscopy assisted by virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) and endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath (EBUS-GS) was performed, and Aspergillus terreus was identified from the culture of obtained specimens. A. terreus is often resistant to amphotericin B; thus, voriconazole is usually recommended for treatment. However, the obtained A. terreus isolate showed minimal inhibitory concentrations of 2 microg/mL for voriconazole and 0.5 microg/mL for amphotericin B. Therefore, the patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B. For patients suspected of having IPA, early diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing are very important. This case suggests that bronchoscopy using VBN and EBUS-GS is helpful for accurate diagnosis and successful treatment even if the lesion is small and the patient has a bleeding risk.","['Yoshii, Naoko', 'Yamada, Koichi', 'Niki, Makoto', 'Imoto, Waki', 'Yamairi, Kazushi', 'Shibata, Wataru', 'Namikawa, Hiroki', 'Sakatoku, Kazuki', 'Sato, Kanako', 'Nakai, Toshiyuki', 'Yamada, Kazuhiro', 'Watanabe, Tetsuya', 'Asai, Kazuhisa', 'Kakeya, Hiroshi', 'Kawaguchi, Tomoya']","['Yoshii N', 'Yamada K', 'Niki M', 'Imoto W', 'Yamairi K', 'Shibata W', 'Namikawa H', 'Sakatoku K', 'Sato K', 'Nakai T', 'Yamada K', 'Watanabe T', 'Asai K', 'Kakeya H', 'Kawaguchi T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2191-9369'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210103,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus terreus', 'Bronchoscopy', 'EBUS-GS', 'Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis', 'Liposomal amphotericin B']",2021/01/04 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2021/01/03 20:42'],"['2020/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/03 20:42 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s15010-020-01545-x [doi]', '10.1007/s15010-020-01545-x [pii]']",ppublish,Infection. 2021 Oct;49(5):1049-1054. doi: 10.1007/s15010-020-01545-x.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to establish the level of DROSHA gene expression in the patients and controls. The results revealed that DROSHA was overexpressed in patients compared with controls (p < 0.001). There were no major differences between DROSHA expression and demographic factors and clinicopathological parameters (p > 0.001).

However, no study has evaluated the possible direct or indirect effects of pathogens on the Taiwanese leopard cat population. Here, we targeted viral pathogens, including carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (genus Protoparvovirus), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronaviruses (CoVs), and canine distemper virus (CDV), through molecular screening. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we clarified the phylogenetic relationship of viral pathogens isolated from leopard cats and domestic carnivores. Samples from 23 live-trapped leopard cats and 29 that were found dead were collected from 2015 to 2019 in Miaoli County in northwestern Taiwan. Protoparvoviruses and CoVs were detected in leopard cats, and their prevalence (95% confidence interval) was 63.5% (50.4%-76.6%) and 8.8% (0%-18.4%), respectively. Most of the protoparvovirus sequences amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical. All of the CoV sequences amplified from leopard cats were identified as feline CoV. No spatial or temporal aggregation of protoparvovirus infection in leopard cats was found in the sampling area, indicating a wide distribution of protoparvoviruses in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the identified pathogens. We strongly recommend management of protoparvoviruses and feline CoV in the leopard cat habitat, particularly vaccination programs and population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats.","['Chen, Chen-Chih', 'Chang, Ai-Mei', 'Chen, Wan-Jhen', 'Chang, Po-Jen', 'Lai, Yu-Ching', 'Lee, Hsu-Hsun']","['Chen CC', 'Chang AM', 'Chen WJ', 'Chang PJ', 'Lai YC', 'Lee HH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9001-5323'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210103,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,,,2021/01/04 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2021/01/03 20:38'],"['2020/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/03 20:38 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-020-04904-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-020-04904-z [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2021 Feb;166(2):427-438. doi: 10.1007/s00705-020-04904-z.

A total of 37 patients (HID-HSCT, 24; ISD-HSCT, 13) developed CNS relapse after transplantation between January 2009 and January 2019, with an incidence of 1.81%. The median time from transplantation to CNS relapse was 239 days. Pre-HSCT CNS involvement (HR 6.940, 95% CI 3.146-15.306, p < .001) was an independent risk factor for CNS relapse after allo-HSCT for AML. The 3-year overall survival (OS) for patients with CNS relapse was 60.3 +/- 8.8%, which was significantly lower than that in the controls (81.5 +/- 4.5%, p = .003). The incidence of CNS relapse was 1.64% for patients who received HID-HSCT and 2.55% for those who received ISD-HSCT (p = .193). There was no significant difference in OS between the HID-HSCT and ISD-HSCT subgroups among the patients with CNS relapse. In conclusion, CNS relapse is a rare but serious complication after allo-HSCT for AML, and the incidence and outcomes of patients with CNS relapse are comparable following HID-HSCT and ISD-HSCT.","['Chen, Qi', 'Zhu, Xiao-Lu', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Fu, Hai-Xia', 'Zhang, Yuan-Yuan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Han, Wei', 'Chen, Huan', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Wang, Yu', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui']","['Chen Q', 'Zhu XL', 'Zhao X', 'Liu X', 'Fu HX', 'Zhang YY', 'Chen YH', 'Mo XD', 'Han W', 'Chen H', 'Yan CH', 'Wang Y', 'Chang YJ', 'Xu LP', 'Huang XJ', 'Zhang XH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0245-6792'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20210102,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Central nervous system', 'Prognosis', 'Relapse']",2021/01/04 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2021/01/03 20:37'],"['2020/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/03 20:37 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04380-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04380-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Feb;100(2):505-516. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04380-0.

So far, no data have been reported on the management of dyslipidemia in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with nilotinib. We investigated 369 CML adult patients, stratified according to the new Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) scoring system. Plasma levels of cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were measured prior to the start of nilotinib and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The 5-year cumulative incidence of AOEs was 15.9%. Patients with cholesterol levels > 200 mg/dL and LDL > 70 mg/dL 3 months after treatment showed a significantly higher incidence of AOEs (21.9 +/- 4.6% vs 6.2 +/- 2.5, P = 0.003). Patients belonging to the high and very high SCORE risk group showed a significant increase of AOEs (34.4 +/- 6% vs 10 +/- 2.1%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, both high cholesterol and LDL levels and a high and very high SCORE risk remained significantly associated with the risk of AOEs (P = 0.008; HR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4-8.7 and P < 0.001; HR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2-9.8, respectively). Overall, 78 patients (21.1%) presented dyslipidemia at the time of CML diagnosis and 88 (23.3%) after starting nilotinib, but only 26 of them (29.5%) were treated with statins.Low LDL and cholesterol plasma levels are associated with a significant lower risk of AOEs in CML patients treated with nilotinib in the real life.","['Caocci, Giovanni', 'Mulas, Olga', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Fozza, Claudio', 'Luzi, Debora', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Simula, Maria Pina', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Barate, Claudia', 'De Gregorio, Fiorenza', 'Stella, Rossella', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Pirillo, Francesca', 'Trawinska, Malgorzata Monika', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Attolico, Immacolata', 'Scalzulli, Emilia', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Foa, Robin', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'La Nasa, Giorgio']","['Caocci G', 'Mulas O', 'Capodanno I', 'Bonifacio M', 'Annunziata M', 'Galimberti S', 'Luciano L', 'Tiribelli M', 'Martino B', 'Castagnetti F', 'Binotto G', 'Pregno P', 'Stagno F', 'Abruzzese E', 'Bocchia M', 'Gozzini A', 'Albano F', 'Fozza C', 'Luzi D', 'Efficace F', 'Simula MP', 'Scaffidi L', 'Barate C', 'De Gregorio F', 'Stella R', 'Gugliotta G', 'Pirillo F', 'Trawinska MM', 'Sicuranza A', 'Cattaneo D', 'Attolico I', 'Scalzulli E', 'Iurlo A', 'Foa R', 'Breccia M', 'La Nasa G']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6585-5187'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210103,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Arterial occlusive event', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'LDL', 'Nilotinib', 'Triglycerides']",2021/01/04 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2021/01/03 20:36'],"['2020/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/03 20:36 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04392-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04392-w [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Aug;100(8):2005-2014. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04392-w.

By providing stringent genetically clonal conditions, iPSC modeling can also unveil non-genetic sources of cancer heterogeneity and provide a unique opportunity to study them separately from genetic sources, as we recently showed in an iPSC-based model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genetically clonal iPSCs, derived from a patient with AML, reproduce, upon hematopoietic differentiation, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity with all the hallmarks of a leukemia stem cell (LSC) hierarchy. Here we discuss the lessons that can be learned about the LSC state, its plasticity, stability and genetic and epigenetic determinants from iPSC modeling.

So, analyzing the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a good opportunity to know the antitumor effects and regulatory effects of NK cells through HLA class 1 matching and mismatching of donor and recipient. In this review, I looked back on the main analysis results of the past transplants, summarized our reports consisting of many cases in a single ethnic, and showed that NK cells might work oppositely depending on the type of leukemia.

We used chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a model to investigate the interactions between the tumor microenvironment and CART cells. CLL is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment, an abundance of systemic extracellular vesicles (EVs), and a relatively lower durable response rate to CART cell therapy. In this study, we characterized plasma EVs from untreated CLL patients and identified their leukemic cell origin. CLL-derived EVs were able to induce a state of CART cell dysfunction characterized by phenotypical, functional, and transcriptional changes of exhaustion. We demonstrate that, specifically, PD-L1(+) CLL-derived EVs induce CART cell exhaustion. In conclusion, we identify an important mechanism of CART cell exhaustion induced by EVs from CLL patients.","['Cox, Michelle J', 'Lucien, Fabrice', 'Sakemura, Reona', 'Boysen, Justin C', 'Kim, Yohan', 'Horvei, Paulina', 'Manriquez Roman, Claudia', 'Hansen, Michael J', 'Tapper, Erin E', 'Siegler, Elizabeth L', 'Forsman, Cynthia', 'Crotts, Sydney B', 'Schick, Kendall J', 'Hefazi, Mehrdad', 'Ruff, Michael W', 'Can, Ismail', 'Adada, Mohamad', 'Bezerra, Evandro', 'Kankeu Fonkoua, Lionel Aurelien', 'Nevala, Wendy K', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Ding, Wei', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Kenderian, Saad S']","['Cox MJ', 'Lucien F', 'Sakemura R', 'Boysen JC', 'Kim Y', 'Horvei P', 'Manriquez Roman C', 'Hansen MJ', 'Tapper EE', 'Siegler EL', 'Forsman C', 'Crotts SB', 'Schick KJ', 'Hefazi M', 'Ruff MW', 'Can I', 'Adada M', 'Bezerra E', 'Kankeu Fonkoua LA', 'Nevala WK', 'Braggio E', 'Ding W', 'Parikh SA', 'Kay NE', 'Kenderian SS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210101,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CART cell exhaustion', '*chimeric antigen receptor T cells', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*extracellular vesicles', '*microenvironment']",2021/01/04 06:00,2021/11/20 06:00,['2021/01/03 20:27'],"['2020/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/07 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/03 20:27 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(20)30726-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2021 Apr 7;29(4):1529-1540. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.033.

The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-cancer property of second-generation of the proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib (CFZ) on APL-derived NB4 cells. Our results showed that pharmacologic targeting of proteasome in NB4 reduced the proliferative rate of malignant cells through a c-Myc-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest. Moreover, we found that the suppression of proteasome was coupled with the induction of apoptotic NB4 cell death, which is probably mediated through down-regulation of anti-apoptotic target genes. Interestingly, our results suggested that the suppression of the autophagy system using chloroquine could serve as a mechanism through which the cytotoxicity of CFZ in APL cells was ameliorated. Finally, and consistent with the favorable efficacy of single agent of CFZ, we also noted an intensifying effect of the inhibitor on the anti-leukemic activity of arsenic trioxide (ATO) when it was used in combination. Overall, this study suggests that pharmaceutical targeting of proteasome using CFZ, either as a single agent or in combination with ATO, could be a promising mechanism through which the obstacle on the way of APL would be tackled; however, further investigations are needed to determine the advantages of the inhibitor in clinical applications.","['Zamani-Moghaddam, Nahid', 'Mousavi, Fahime S', 'Esmaeili, Shadi', 'Yousefi, Amir-Mohammad', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Zamani-Moghaddam N', 'Mousavi FS', 'Esmaeili S', 'Yousefi AM', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Bashash D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201211,England,Cancer Treat Res Commun,Cancer treatment and research communications,101694651,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyeloid leukemia', '*Arsenic trioxide', '*Carfilzomib', '*Nb4 cells', '*Proteasome inhibition']",2021/01/03 06:00,2022/01/01 06:00,['2021/01/02 20:12'],"['2020/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 20:12 [entrez]']","['S2468-2942(20)30119-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctarc.2020.100284 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Res Commun. 2021;26:100284. doi: 10.1016/j.ctarc.2020.100284.

However, approximately 50% of patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL do not respond to blinatumomab, and the correlation between T cell phenotype and blinatumomab response remains unclear. To assess this correlation, we longitudinally compared immune checkpoint molecules in T cells before and during blinatumomab treatment between a responder and non-responder. In the responder, the expression level of granzyme B increased following infusion of blinatumomab and complete remission was achieved. On the other hand, the non-responder consistently expressed higher levels of programmed death-1 (PD-1), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3), and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) in CD8 + T cells than the responder during blinatumomab treatment and showed no response despite the addition of two donor lymphocyte infusions. Furthermore, the residual tumors in bone marrow after blinatumomab treatment showed increased expression of immune checkpoint ligands: PD-L1 (PD-1 ligand), Galectin-9 (Tim-3 ligand), PD-L2 (PD-1 ligand) and CD155 (TIGIT ligand). In conclusion, immune checkpoint molecule levels could correlate with response to blinatumomab.","['Kobayashi, Takahiro', 'Ubukawa, Kumi', 'Fujishima, Masumi', 'Takahashi, Naoto']","['Kobayashi T', 'Ubukawa K', 'Fujishima M', 'Takahashi N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9914-7517'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210102,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Blinatumomab', 'Immune checkpoint molecules', 'Regulatory T cells']",2021/01/03 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/01/02 12:10'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 12:10 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-03047-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-03047-w [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Apr;113(4):600-605. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-03047-w.

We also reviewed and analyzed the relevant literature, incorporating our findings into the discussion. All three patients developed septic shock with neutropenia following chemotherapy. Analysis of blood samples confirmed the presence of C. perfringens, and two patients had fulminant intravascular hemolysis and developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Two patients survived and one died despite timely and full-dose antibacterial treatments, blood purification, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Overall, our findings showed that C. perfringens sepsis is rare in patients with acute leukemia but progresses rapidly. A high mortality rate was observed, and patients often experienced refractory shock and intravascular hemolysis. This demonstrates the importance of early detection and diagnosis.

Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic value and clinical characteristics of ASXL1 mutations in PMF patients. Eligible studies were systematically searched from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. We extracted the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS), the number of patients transformed to acute leukemia, and clinical characteristics to carry out a meta-analysis by fixed effect model or random effect model according to the heterogeneity between studies. A total of 4501 PMF patients from 16 cohorts of 14 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that ASXL1 mutations might predict a shorter OS (HR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.79-2.94, P < 0.00001) and a higher probability of transformation to acute leukemia (LFS: HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.30-2.42, P = 0.0003; the rate of acute leukemia transformation: OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.50-2.83, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, ASXL1 mutations were correlated with patients older than 65 years old, male, a lower level of platelet counts, and a higher risk of the international prognostic score system. These findings indicate that ASXL1 mutations have a significant adverse impact on the prognosis of PMF patients and may contribute to risk stratification and prognostic assessment for PMF patients.","['Wang, Ziqing', 'Liu, Weiyi', 'Wang, Mingjing', 'Li, Yujin', 'Wang, Xueying', 'Yang, Erpeng', 'Ming, Jing', 'Quan, Richeng', 'Hu, Xiaomei']","['Wang Z', 'Liu W', 'Wang M', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Yang E', 'Ming J', 'Quan R', 'Hu X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7955-7041'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20210102,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1 mutations', 'Clinical features', 'Meta-analysis', 'Primary myelofibrosis', 'Prognostic value']",2021/01/03 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2021/01/02 12:07'],"['2020/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 12:07 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04387-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04387-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Feb;100(2):465-479. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04387-7.

This study was aimed at (a) enhanced search for GATA1 mutations; and (b) characterization of molecular landscapes for such conditions. METHODS: The DNA samples from 44 patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML with trisomy 21 were examined by fragment analysis and Sanger sequencing of the GATA1 exon 2, complemented by targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS). RESULTS: Acquired GATA1 mutations were identified in 43 cases (98%). Additional mutations in the genes of JAK/STAT signaling, cohesin complex, and RAS pathway activation were revealed by HTS in 48%, 36%, and 16% of the cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The GATA1 mutations were reliably determined by fragment analysis and/or Sanger sequencing in a single PCR amplicon manner. For patients with extremely low blast counts and/or rare variants, the rapid screening with simple molecular approaches must be complemented with HTS. The JAK/STAT and RAS pathway-activating mutations may represent an extra option of targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors.","['Panferova, Agnesa', 'Gaskova, Marina', 'Nikitin, Eugenyi', 'Baryshev, Pavel', 'Timofeeva, Natalia', 'Kazakova, Anna', 'Matveev, Viktor', 'Mikhailova, Ekaterina', 'Popov, Alexander', 'Kalinina, Irina', 'Hachatrian, Lili', 'Maschan, Aleksey', 'Maschan, Michael', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Olshanskaya, Yulia']","['Panferova A', 'Gaskova M', 'Nikitin E', 'Baryshev P', 'Timofeeva N', 'Kazakova A', 'Matveev V', 'Mikhailova E', 'Popov A', 'Kalinina I', 'Hachatrian L', 'Maschan A', 'Maschan M', 'Novichkova G', 'Olshanskaya Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8580-3499'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210102,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'acute leukemias', 'bone marrow', 'molecular diagnosis', 'pediatrics']",2021/01/03 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2021/01/02 08:33'],"['2020/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 08:33 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13451 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Aug;43(4):713-723. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13451.

Patients with high-risk characteristics and ALL-T had inferior outcomes: even with undetectable MRD on day 33, cumulative incidence of relapse was 19.9% and 23.4%, respectively. Moreover, those with poor early-treatment response and detectable week-12 MRD had a worse prognosis. After adjusting for other risk factors, re-emergent MRD was the most significant adverse prognostic indicator overall. Sequential MRD measurement is important for MRD-guided therapy, and integration of MRD values at different timepoints based on leukemia subtype could allow for more refined risk stratification.","['Xue, Yu-Juan', 'Wang, Yu', 'Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Wu, Jun', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Zhang, Le-Ping']","['Xue YJ', 'Wang Y', 'Jia YP', 'Zuo YX', 'Wu J', 'Lu AD', 'Zhang LP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5233-8738'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210101,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Childhood', 'Leukemia groups', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Sequential']",2021/01/03 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/01/02 05:20'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 05:20 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-03063-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-03063-w [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Apr;113(4):547-555. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-03063-w.

A higher WBC count at diagnosis was associated with failure to achieve early molecular response (EMR). Height standard deviation score after long-term treatment was significantly and positively correlated with age at diagnosis and at the start of IM therapy. Overall, IM therapy was effective in treating pediatric CML, and WBC count at diagnosis might be an ideal predictor of EMR. Moreover, retardation of height and weight growth due to IM tended to affect patients younger than 9 years old at diagnosis, and longitudinal growth might normalize further into treatment.","['Cai, Yuli', 'Liu, Chao', 'Guo, Ye', 'Chen, Xiaojuan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Chen, Yumei', 'Zou, Yao', 'Yang, Wenyu', 'Zhu, Xiaofan']","['Cai Y', 'Liu C', 'Guo Y', 'Chen X', 'Zhang L', 'Chen Y', 'Zou Y', 'Yang W', 'Zhu X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210101,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL positive', 'Chronic', 'Growth', 'Imatinib mesylate', 'Leukemia', 'Myelogenous', 'Pediatrics']",2021/01/03 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2021/01/02 05:20'],"['2020/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 05:20 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-03042-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-03042-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Mar;113(3):413-421. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-03042-1.

Our aim was to study the accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (2-[18F]-FDG PET/CT) and its semiquantitative parameters for the detection of RS and the impact on overall survival (OS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients with histologically proven CLL were retrospectively included. PET/CT images were qualitatively and semiquantitatively examined by estimating the maximum standardized uptake value body weight (SUVbw), lean body mass (SUVlbm), body surface area (SUVbsa), lesion-to-blood-pool SUV ratio (L-BP SUV R), lesion-to-liver SUV ratio (L-L SUV R), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and comparing them with the main clinical-histologic variables. OS curves were plotted according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients had positive 2-[(18)F]-FDG PET/CT, whereas the remaining 2 were not FDG-avid. All PET/CT metabolic parameters were significantly higher in the RS group compared with the no-RS group, except for MTV and TLG. The best thresholds identified were 9 for SUVbw, 5.3 for SUVlbm, 1.7 for SUVbsa, 2 for L-L SUV R, and 4.8 for L-BP SUV R. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 24 patients died; OS was significantly shorter in patients with RS than patients without RS (16.5 vs. 27.8 months; P = .001). Binet-stage, B symptoms, SUVbw, SUVlbm, SUVbsa, L-L SUV R, and L-BP SUV R were shown to be independent prognostic features. CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative PET/CT parameters that are SUV-related may be useful in discriminating patients with a high risk of developing RS and also for predicting OS.","['Albano, Domenico', 'Camoni, Luca', 'Rodella, Carlo', 'Giubbini, Raffaele', 'Bertagna, Francesco']","['Albano D', 'Camoni L', 'Rodella C', 'Giubbini R', 'Bertagna F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*18F-FDG', '*CLL', '*PET/CT', '*Richter transformation']",2021/01/03 06:00,2022/01/06 06:00,['2021/01/02 05:15'],"['2020/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 05:15 [entrez]']","['S2152-2650(20)30670-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2020.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2021 Mar;21(3):e277-e283. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2020.12.003.

Three steps, involving different pathways, have been recognised in either acute and chronic GvHD, identifying them as two distinct entities. In order to reduce GvHD incidence and severity, prophylactic measures were added to transplant protocols. The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) plus an antimetabolite remains the standard of care. Better knowledge of GvHD pathophysiology has moved this field forward and nowadays different drugs are being used on a daily basis. Improving GvHD prophylaxis is a major goal as it would translate into less non-relapse mortality and better overall survival. As compared to CNI plus methotrexate the combination of CNI plus mycophenolate mophetil (MMF) allows us to obtain similar results in terms of GvHD incidence but a lower toxicity rate in terms of neutropenia or mucositis. The use of ATG has been related to a lower risk of acute and chronic GvHD in prospective randomized trials as well as the use of posttransplant Cyclophosphamide, with no or marginal impact on overall survival but with an improvement in GvHD-relapse free survival (GRFS). The use of sirolimus has been related to a lower risk of acute GvHD and significantly influenced overall survival in one prospective randomized trial. Other prospective trials have evaluated the use of receptors such as CCR5 or alpha4beta7 to avoid T-cells trafficking into GvHD target organs, cytokine blockers or immune check point agonists. Also, epigenetic modifiers have shown promising results in phase II trials. Attention should be paid to graft-versus-leukemia, infections and immune recovery before bringing new prophylactic strategies to clinical practice. Although the list of novel agents for GvHD prophylaxis is growing, randomized trials are still lacking for many of them.","['Martinez-Cibrian, Nuria', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Perez-Simon, Jose A']","['Martinez-Cibrian N', 'Zeiser R', 'Perez-Simon JA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201226,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant', '*Antimetabolites', '*Calcineurin inhibitors', '*Graft-versus-host disease', '*Prophylaxis']",2021/01/03 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2021/01/02 05:14'],"['2020/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/02 05:14 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(20)30142-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2020.100792 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2021 Jul;48:100792. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2020.100792.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is sometimes considered for selected RIMs. The authors investigated the effectiveness and safety of SRS for the management of RIMs. METHODS: From 12 institutions participating in the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation, the authors pooled patients who had prior cranial irradiation and were subsequently clinically diagnosed with WHO grade I meningiomas that were managed with SRS. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients underwent 60 SRS procedures for histologically confirmed or radiologically suspected WHO grade I RIMs. The median ages at initial cranial radiation therapy and SRS for RIM were 5.5 years and 39 years, respectively. The most common reasons for cranial radiation therapy were leukemia (21%) and medulloblastoma (17%). There were 39 multiple RIMs (35%), the mean target volume was 8.61 +/- 7.80 cm3, and the median prescription dose was 14 Gy. The median imaging follow-up duration was 48 months (range 4-195 months). RIM progressed in 9 patients (17%) at a median duration of 30 months (range 3-45 months) after SRS. Progression-free survival at 5 years post-SRS was 83%. Treatment volume >/= 5 cm3 predicted progression (HR 8.226, 95% CI 1.028-65.857, p = 0.047). Seven patients (14%) developed new neurological symptoms or experienced SRS-related complications or T2 signal change from 1 to 72 months after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: SRS is associated with durable local control of RIMs in the majority of patients and has an acceptable safety profile. SRS can be considered for patients and tumors that are deemed suboptimal, poor surgical candidates, and those whose tumor again progresses after removal.","['Bunevicius, Adomas', 'Suleiman, Mohand', 'Patel, Samir', 'Martinez Alvarez, Roberto', 'Martinez Moreno, Nuria E', 'Liscak, Roman', 'Hanuska, Jaromir', 'Langlois, Anne-Marie', 'Mathieu, David', 'Mau, Christine', 'Caldwell, Catherine', 'Tuanquin, Leonard C', 'Zacharia, Brad E', 'McInerney, James', 'Lee, Cheng-Chia', 'Yang, Huai-Che', 'Peterson, Jennifer L', 'Trifiletti, Daniel M', 'Ogino, Akiyoshi', 'Kano, Hideyuki', 'Warnick, Ronald E', 'Saylany, Anissa', 'Buch, Love Y', 'Lee, John Y K', 'Strickland, Ben A', 'Zada, Gabriel', 'Chang, Eric L', 'Lunsford, L Dade', 'Sheehan, Jason']","['Bunevicius A', 'Suleiman M', 'Patel S', 'Martinez Alvarez R', 'Martinez Moreno NE', 'Liscak R', 'Hanuska J', 'Langlois AM', 'Mathieu D', 'Mau C', 'Caldwell C', 'Tuanquin LC', 'Zacharia BE', 'McInerney J', 'Lee CC', 'Yang HC', 'Peterson JL', 'Trifiletti DM', 'Ogino A', 'Kano H', 'Warnick RE', 'Saylany A', 'Buch LY', 'Lee JYK', 'Strickland BA', 'Zada G', 'Chang EL', 'Lunsford LD', 'Sheehan J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210101,United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Gamma Knife', 'local control', 'oncology', 'progression-free survival', 'radiation-induced meningioma', 'safety', 'stereotactic radiosurgery']",2021/01/02 06:00,2021/01/02 06:00,['2021/01/01 20:16'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 20:16 [entrez]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3171/2020.7.JNS202064 [doi]', '2020.7.JNS202064 [pii]']",aheadofprint,J Neurosurg. 2021 Jan 1:1-9. doi: 10.3171/2020.7.JNS202064.,,,"['1Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia.', '1Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia.', '2Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', '3Gamma Knife Radiosurgery, Hospital Ruber Internacional, Madrid, Spain.', '3Gamma Knife Radiosurgery, Hospital Ruber Internacional, Madrid, Spain.', '4Stereotactic and Radiation Neurosurgery, Na Homolce Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', '4Stereotactic and Radiation Neurosurgery, Na Homolce Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', '5Division of Neurosurgery, Universite de Sherbrooke, Centre de recherche du CHUS, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', '5Division of Neurosurgery, Universite de Sherbrooke, Centre de recherche du CHUS, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', '6Penn State Health, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', '6Penn State Health, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', '6Penn State Health, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', '6Penn State Health, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', '6Penn State Health, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', '7Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '7Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '8Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', '8Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', '9Department of Neurologic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', '9Department of Neurologic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', '10Jewish Hospital, Mayfield Clinic, Cincinnati, Ohio.', '11Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and.', '11Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and.', '11Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and.', '12University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', '12University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', '12University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', '9Department of Neurologic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', '1Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nanoprecipitation method was used for the preparation of cytarabine loaded PCL nanoparticles. The developed nanoparticles were characterized for physicochemical properties and the anti-leukemic effect on the KG-1 cell line was evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: A total number of five formulations were prepared with size range from 120.5 +/- 1.18 to 341.5 +/- 3.02, entrapment efficiency (41.31 +/- 0.49 to 62.28 +/- 0.39%), spherical morphology, negative zeta potentials, considerable particle size distribution, compatibility between the drug and excipients and thermal stability. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the successful incorporation of cytarabine in PCL polymer. In vitro drug release in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) showed initial burst release followed by sustained release up to 48 h. The sustained release behaviour efficiently increased the toxicity of cytarabine-loaded PCL nanoparticles to KG-1 (leukemic) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines in time dependent manner with lower IC50 values than that of drug solution. The flow cytometry study revealed the better apoptotic activity of cytarabine loaded PCL nanoparticle against treated KG-1 cell line. The western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 protein. SIGNIFICANCE: The experimental results suggest that cytarabine loaded PCL nanoparticles is an efficient carrier to prevent the dose associated toxicity while providing sustained release pattern to ensure maximum anti-cancer influence.","['Jan, Nasrullah', 'Madni, Asadullah', 'Rahim, Muhammad Abdur', 'Khan, Naveed Ullah', 'Jamshaid, Talha', 'Khan, Arshad', 'Jabar, Abdul', 'Khan, Safiullah', 'Shah, Hassan']","['Jan N', 'Madni A', 'Rahim MA', 'Khan NU', 'Jamshaid T', 'Khan A', 'Jabar A', 'Khan S', 'Shah H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201229,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cytarabine', 'KG-1 cell line', 'Nanoprecipitation', 'PCL nanoparticles', 'Sustained release']",2021/01/02 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2021/01/01 20:07'],"['2020/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/01 20:07 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(20)31731-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118971 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2021 Feb 15;267:118971. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118971.

Inflammation is associated with MDS pathogenesis. Several cytokines, reactive species of oxygen/nitrogen and growth factors are directly or indirectly involved in dysfunction of the MDS bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Mutations in genes mainly regulating RNA splicing, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, transcription factors, signal transduction and the response to DNA damage contribute to ineffective hematopoiesis, genomic instability and MDS development. The inflammation-associated DNA damage in hematopoietic stem cells may also contribute to MDS development and progression with aggressive clinical characteristics. Many studies have aimed at clarifying mechanisms involved in the activity of immature myeloid cells as powerful modulators of the immune response and their correlation with aging, autoimmunity, and development of cancer. In this review, we explore recent advances and accumulating evidence uniting immune dysregulation, inflammaging and recurring mutations in the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Matos, Anacelia', 'Magalhaes, Silvia M M', 'Rauh, Michael J']","['Matos A', 'Magalhaes SMM', 'Rauh MJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Inflammation', 'Mutations', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",2021/01/02 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/01/01 05:24'],"['2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/01 05:24 [entrez]']",['10.1007/5584_2020_608 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2021;1326:1-10. doi: 10.1007/5584_2020_608.,20210722,['(c) 2020.

However, little is known about aging, lifestyle and genetic factors influencing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abundance. In this study, mtDNA abundance was estimated from the weighted intensities of probes mapping to the MT genome in 295,150 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that the abundance of mtDNA was significantly elevated in women compared to men, was negatively correlated with advanced age, higher smoking exposure, greater body-mass index, higher frailty index as well as elevated red and white blood cell count and lower mortality. In addition, several biochemistry markers in blood-related to cholesterol metabolism, ion homeostasis and kidney function were found to be significantly associated with mtDNA abundance. By performing a genome-wide association study, we identified 50 independent regions genome-wide significantly associated with mtDNA abundance which harbour multiple genes involved in the immune system, cancer as well as mitochondrial function. Using mixed effects models, we estimated the SNP-heritability of mtDNA abundance to be around 8%. To investigate the consequence of altered mtDNA abundance, we performed a phenome-wide association study and found that mtDNA abundance is involved in risk for leukaemia, hematologic diseases as well as hypertension. Thus, estimating mtDNA abundance from genotyping arrays has the potential to provide novel insights into age- and disease-relevant processes, particularly those related to immunity and established mitochondrial functions.","['Hagg, Sara', 'Jylhava, Juulia', 'Wang, Yunzhang', 'Czene, Kamila', 'Grassmann, Felix']","['Hagg S', 'Jylhava J', 'Wang Y', 'Czene K', 'Grassmann F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1390-7528'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201231,Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,IM,,,2021/01/02 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2021/01/01 05:24'],"['2020/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/01 05:24 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00439-020-02249-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00439-020-02249-w [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Genet. 2021 Jun;140(6):849-861. doi: 10.1007/s00439-020-02249-w.

Accurate information of the global burden of CML is critical for direct health policy and healthcare resource allocation in the era of high-cost TKI therapy. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the health burden of CML at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2017. Methods: We collected data of CML between 1990 and 2017 from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017 including, annual incidence, disease-related mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), and the corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs). To summarize the results, countries were categorized by sociodemographic index (SDI) quintiles and 21 GBD regions. Results: In 2017, an estimated 34,179 [95% Uncertainty Interval (UI), 31,516-36,714) incident cases of CML were recorded, and 24,054 (95%UI, 22,233-26,072) CML-related deaths were reported worldwide. Both, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized death rate (ASDR) steadily decreased from 1990 to 2017, with estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of -2.39 (95%UI, -8.13-3.71) and -2.74 (95%UI, -9.31-4.31), respectively. The global incidence and mortality of CML in males were higher than that in females. The ASRs varied substantially across regions, with the highest burden in Andean Latin America, Central Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. Besides, the ASRs decreased most obviously in the high-SDI regions compared to non-high-SDI regions. Moreover, the lower the SDI, the higher was the proportion of deaths in the younger age groups. Conclusion: Despite the decreasing trends of ASRs of CML from 1990 to 2017, the health-related burden of CML remains a challenge for the low-SDI regions. These findings highlight that appropriate strategies should be adopted in low-SDI countries to reduce the ASRs of CML.","['Lin, Qingqing', 'Mao, Liping', 'Shao, Li', 'Zhu, Li', 'Han, Qingmei', 'Zhu, Honghu', 'Jin, Jie', 'You, Liangshun']","['Lin Q', 'Mao L', 'Shao L', 'Zhu L', 'Han Q', 'Zhu H', 'Jin J', 'You L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201215,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'death', 'disability-adjusted life-years', 'epidemiology', 'incidence']",2021/01/02 06:00,2021/01/02 06:01,['2021/01/01 05:23'],"['2020/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 05:23 [entrez]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.580759 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 15;10:580759. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.580759. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Lin, Mao, Shao, Zhu, Han, Zhu, Jin and You.']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7770240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of haploidentical HSCT has made it possible to have ""a donor for everyone"". Patients who received transplantation in remission may have a favorable outcome, while those who were transplanted in advanced stages of disease have a poor prognosis. Although chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is currently a milestone in the immunotherapy of relapsed or refractory (R/R) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and has demonstrated high remission rates in patients previously treated in multiple lines, the relatively high relapse rate remains a barrier to CAR-T cell therapy becoming an excellent cure option. Therefore, combining these two approaches (allo-HSCT and CAR-T cell therapy) is an attractive area of research to further improve the prognosis of R/R B-ALL. In this review, we will discuss the current clinical practices of combining allo-HSCT with CAR-T cell therapy based on available data, including CAR-T cells as a bridge to allo-HSCT for R/R B-ALL and CAR-T cell infusion for post-transplant relapse. We will further explore not only other possible ways to combine the two approaches, including CAR-T cell therapy to clear minimal residual disease peri-transplantation and incorporation of CAR technology to treat graft-versus-host disease, but also the potential of CAR-T cells as a part of allo-HSCT.","['Zhang, Mingming', 'Huang, He']","['Zhang M', 'Huang H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201215,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*graft versus host disease', '*minimal residual disease', '*relapsed or refractory', '*stem cell transplant']",2021/01/02 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2021/01/01 05:22'],"['2020/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 05:22 [entrez]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.611710 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Dec 15;11:611710. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.611710. eCollection 2020.,20210622,['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang and Huang.'],"['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Cellular Immunotherapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Cellular Immunotherapy, Hangzhou, China.']","['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']","['Animals', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Genetic Therapy/adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']","['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7770154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NKG2D-ligands are a promising target given their absence on healthy cells and surface expression in a wide range of malignancies. NKG2D-ligand expression has been reported in a substantial group of patients with AML along with evidence for prognostic significance. However, reports regarding the prevalence and density of NKG2D-ligand expression in AML vary and detailed studies to define whether low level expression is sufficient to trigger NKG2D-ligand directed CART cell responses are lacking. NKG2D ligand expression in T-ALL has not previously been interrogated. Here we report that NKG2D-ligands are expressed in T-ALL cell lines and primary T-ALL. We confirm that NKG2D-ligands are frequently surface expressed in primary AML, albeit at relatively low levels. Utilizing CAR T cells incorporating the natural immune receptor NKG2D as the antigen binding domain, we demonstrate striking in vitro activity of CAR T cells targeting NKG2D-ligands against AML and T-ALL cell lines and show that even low-level ligand expression in primary AML targets results in robust NKG2D-CAR activity. We found that NKG2D-ligand expression can be selectively enhanced in low-expressing AML cell lines and primary AML blasts via pharmacologic HDAC inhibition. Such pharmacologic NKG2D-ligand induction results in enhanced NKG2D-CAR anti-leukemic activity without affecting healthy PBMC, thereby providing rationale for the combination of HDAC-inhibitors with NKG2D-CAR T cell therapy as a potential strategy to achieve clinical NKG2D-CAR T cell efficacy in AML.","['Driouk, Lina', 'Gicobi, Joanina K', 'Kamihara, Yusuke', 'Rutherford, Kayleigh', 'Dranoff, Glenn', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Baumeister, Susanne H C']","['Driouk L', 'Gicobi JK', 'Kamihara Y', 'Rutherford K', 'Dranoff G', 'Ritz J', 'Baumeister SHC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201215,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cells', '*NKG2D activating receptor', '*NKG2D-ligands', '*T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*acute myeloid leukemia']",2021/01/02 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/01/01 05:22'],"['2020/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 05:22 [entrez]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.580328 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Dec 15;11:580328. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.580328. eCollection 2020.,20210621,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Driouk, Gicobi, Kamihara, Rutherford, Dranoff, Ritz and', 'Baumeister.']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with AML excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed. Patients in the earlier cohort (n = 36) were treated on the Medical Research Council (MRC) AML12 protocol, whereas those in the recent cohort (n = 26) were treated on the Malaysia-Singapore AML protocol (MASPORE 2006), which differed in terms of risk group stratification, cumulative anthracycline dose, and timing of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for high-risk patients. RESULTS: Significant improvements in 10-year overall survival and event-free survival were observed in patients treated with the recent MASPORE 2006 protocol compared to the earlier MRC AML12 protocol (overall survival: 88.0% +/- 6.5% vs 50.1% +/- 8.6%, P = .002; event-free survival: 72.1% +/- 9.0 vs 50.1% +/- 8.6%, P = .045). In univariate analysis, patients in the recent cohort had significantly lower intensive care unit admission rate (11.5% vs 47.2%, P = .005) and numerically lower relapse rate (26.9% vs 50.0%, P = .068) compared to the earlier cohort. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment protocol was the only independent predictive factor for overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.73, P = .014). CONCLUSION: Outcomes of pediatric AML patients have improved over time. The more recent MASPORE 2006 protocol led to significant improvement in long-term survival rates and reduction in intensive care unit admission rate.","['Sutiman, Natalia', 'Nwe, Mya Soe', 'Ni Lai, Eunice En', 'Lee, Denyse Kawai', 'Chan, Mei Yoke', 'Eng-Juh Yeoh, Allen', 'Soh, Shui Yen', 'Leung, Wing', 'Tan, Ah Moy']","['Sutiman N', 'Nwe MS', 'Ni Lai EE', 'Lee DK', 'Chan MY', 'Eng-Juh Yeoh A', 'Soh SY', 'Leung W', 'Tan AM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201201,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Childhood leukemia', '*MRC AML12', '*Pediatrics', '*Prognostic factors']",2021/01/02 06:00,2022/01/06 06:00,['2021/01/01 05:16'],"['2020/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/01/01 05:16 [entrez]']","['S2152-2650(20)30658-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2020.11.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2021 Mar;21(3):e290-e300. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2020.11.016.

This systematic review aims to summarise the published literature concerning cancer-associated urinary VOCs. A systematic online literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting urinary VOC biomarkers of cancers in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Library and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirteen studies comprising 1266 participants in total were included in the review. Studies reported urinary VOC profiles of five cancer subtypes: prostate cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, leukaemia/lymphoma, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. Forty-eight urinary VOCs belonging to eleven chemical classes were identified with high diagnostic performance. VOC profiles were distinctive for each cancer type with limited cross-over. The metabolic analysis suggested distinctive phenotypes for prostate and gastrointestinal cancers. The heterogenicity of study design, methodological and reporting quality may have contributed to inconsistencies between studies. Urinary VOC analysis has shown promising performance for non-invasive diagnosis of cancer. However, limitations in study design have resulted in inconsistencies between studies.

Hif-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, was reported to act as master regulator of killing functions in macrophages. AIM: To investigate whether Hif-1 activation would enhance bactericidal effect of macrophages and anti-tuberculosis effect of chemical reagent. METHODS: Hif-1 and LC3B were detected in tissues from pulmonary tuberculosis. U937, human monocytic leukemia cell line, was stimulated with PMA and differentiated into macrophages. Cells were pretreated with Hif-1 chemical inhibitor YC-1, stimulated with CoCl2 (Hif-1 activator), to detect LC3B with Western blot and confocal microscopy. Cells were infected with M. tb H37Rv strain, stimulated with CoCl2, following rifampine treatment. Expression of autophagy markers was detected using Western blot. IL-6 and TNF-alpha were detected in cell supernatant with ELISA. Acid-fast staining and CFU assay were performed to evaluate intracellular bacterial load. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Hif-1 and LC3B increased in tissues of pulmonary tuberculosis. Hif-1 activation enhanced autophagy in M. tb infected U937 cells and production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Data from acid-fast staining and CFU indicated that Hif-1 activation enhanced anti-tuberculosis effect of rifampine in macrophages. Conclusively, to activate Hif-1 would strengthen bactericidal effect of macrophages, to further enhance anti-tuberculosis effect of chemical reagent.","['Li, Quan', 'Xie, Yuyu', 'Cui, Zhangbo', 'Huang, Hai', 'Yang, Chengqing', 'Yuan, Baodong', 'Shen, Pei', 'Shi, Chunwei']","['Li Q', 'Xie Y', 'Cui Z', 'Huang H', 'Yang C', 'Yuan B', 'Shen P', 'Shi C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201224,Scotland,Tuberculosis (Edinb),"Tuberculosis (Edinburgh, Scotland)",100971555,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*Hif-1', '*Macrophage', '*Mycobacterium tuberculosis', '*Rifampine']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2020/12/31 20:13'],"['2019/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/31 20:13 [entrez]']","['S1472-9792(20)30211-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tube.2020.102044 [doi]']",ppublish,Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2021 Jan;126:102044. doi: 10.1016/j.tube.2020.102044.

Critical to our understanding of the mechanism of cellular transformation by oncogenic transcription factors is the ability to define their direct gene targets. However, gene network cascades can change within minutes to hours, making it difficult to distinguish direct from secondary or compensatory transcriptional changes by traditional methodologies. To overcome this limitation, we devised cell models in which the AML1-ETO protein could be quickly degraded upon addition of a small molecule. The rapid kinetics of AML1-ETO removal, when combined with analysis of transcriptional output by nascent transcript analysis and genome-wide AML1-ETO binding by CUT&RUN, enabled the identification of direct gene targets that constitute a core AML1-ETO regulatory network. Moreover, derepression of this gene network was associated with RUNX1 DNA binding and triggered a transcription cascade ultimately resulting in myeloid differentiation.","['Stengel, Kristy R', 'Ellis, Jacob D', 'Spielman, Clare L', 'Bomber, Monica L', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Stengel KR', 'Ellis JD', 'Spielman CL', 'Bomber ML', 'Hiebert SW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201230,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML1-ETO', '*PRO-seq', '*PROTAC', '*RUNX1', '*RUNX1T1', '*degron tag', '*myeloid leukemia', '*nascent transcription']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/12/31 20:09'],"['2020/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/31 20:09 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(20)30897-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2020.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2021 Feb 4;81(3):530-545.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.12.005.

We retrospectively analyzed factors impacting complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and overall survival (OS) in 197 adults with t(8;21) AML, of whom 107 cases were induced with intermediate-dose and 90 with standard-dose Ara-C (as part of 3 + 7 protocol). After a single induction course, the overall CR rate was 87.6% (170/194), with a significant difference between the standard-dose (83/105, 79.0%) and intermediate-dose (87/89, 97.8%) groups (p < 0.001). Rather than general KITmut, the specific KIT-D816 independently led to a lower probability of achieving CR (HR = 3.29 [1.18-9.24], p = 0.023), worse EFS (HR = 3.53 [1.82-6.84], p < 0.001), and OS (HR = 5.45 [1.77-16.84], p = 0.003) in the standard-dose group, but not in the intermediate-dose group. CD19(+) represented the only independent factor predicting lower CIR both in the standard-dose group (HR = 0.32 [0.10-1.00], p = 0.050) and in the intermediate-dose group (HR = 0.11 [0.03-0.40], p = 0.001). When combined, KIT(+) plus CD19(-) conferred the most increased relapse risk (3-year CIR 60%; SE 0.12). Specific KIT-D816, instead of general KITmut, may be incorporated in prognostication model for t(8;21) AML. Combination of CD19 with KIT provides a more definite risk stratification profile for t(8;21) AML.","['Wang, Biao', 'Yang, Bin', 'Ling, Yun', 'Zhang, Jihong', 'Hua, Xiaoying', 'Gu, Weiying', 'Yan, Feng']","['Wang B', 'Yang B', 'Ling Y', 'Zhang J', 'Hua X', 'Gu W', 'Yan F']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1557-5045'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201231,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['* KIT', '*CD19', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cytarabine', '*t(8;21)']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/12/31 12:10'],"['2020/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/31 12:10 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3705 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2021 Feb;10(3):1091-1102. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3705.

STAT proteins are conserved among eukaryotes and are important for biological functions of embryogenesis, immunity, haematopoiesis and cell migration. STAT3 is widely expressed and located in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. STAT3 is rapidly and transiently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation by a range of signalling pathways, including cytokines from the IL-6 family and growth factors, such as EGF and PDGF. STAT3 activation and subsequent dimer formation initiates nuclear translocation of STAT3 for the regulation of target gene transcription. Four STAT3 isoforms have been identified, which have distinct biological functions. STAT3 is considered a proto-oncogene and constitutive activation of STAT3 is implicated in the development of various cancers, including multiple myeloma, leukaemia and lymphomas. In this review, we focus on recent progress on STAT3 and osteosarcoma (OS). Notably, STAT3 is overexpressed and associated with the poor prognosis of OS. Constitutive activation of STAT3 in OS appears to upregulate the expression of target oncogenes, leading to OS cell transformation, proliferation, tumour formation, invasion, metastasis, immune evasion and drug resistance. Taken together, STAT3 is a target for cancer therapy, and STAT3 inhibitors represent potential therapeutic candidates for the treatment of OS.","['Liu, Yun', 'Liao, Shijie', 'Bennett, Samuel', 'Tang, Haijun', 'Song, Dezhi', 'Wood, David', 'Zhan, Xinli', 'Xu, Jiake']","['Liu Y', 'Liao S', 'Bennett S', 'Tang H', 'Song D', 'Wood D', 'Zhan X', 'Xu J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2021-8309'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201231,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT3 inhibitor', 'metastasis', 'oncogenes', 'osteosarcoma (OS)', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)', 'signalling']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/12/31 12:09'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/31 12:09 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cpr.12974 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2021 Feb;54(2):e12974. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12974.

A 33-year-old man underwent deceased donor liver transplantation due to HBV-HDV cirrhosis in 1991. The donor was healthy, with negative viral serology. Pretransplant assessment and explant liver pathology revealed no tumor. He developed an 8 cm mediastinal thymus cancer in 2014, a chronic myeloid leukemia in 2015 and a 16 mm renal cell carcinoma in 2017. After 27 years, in 2018, his routine follow-up sonography showed incidentally a 37 mm hepatic nodule in segment VII which revealed after percutaneous liver guided biopsy a hepatocellular carcinoma. As no extra hepatic metastasis was noted, segmentectomy was done. The pathological report confirmed a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma nodule of 50 mm diameter with absence of microvascular invasion and the non-tumoral liver showed histological features of NASH (SAF score: S1A2F3, NAS score: A3F3 and LAFSc:5) with absence of HBsAg and HBcAg. This case emphasizes the importance of long-term close surveillance by imaging of the graft even in the absence of viral recurrence and graft cirrhosis.","['El-Domiaty, Nada', 'Saliba, Faouzi', 'Sebagh, Mylene', 'Salloum, Chady', 'Vibert, Eric', 'Azoulay, Daniel', 'Hamelin, Jocelyne', 'Cherqui, Daniel', 'Adam, Rene', 'Samuel, Didier']","['El-Domiaty N', 'Saliba F', 'Sebagh M', 'Salloum C', 'Vibert E', 'Azoulay D', 'Hamelin J', 'Cherqui D', 'Adam R', 'Samuel D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7098-0230', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2058-9217', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6122-2542']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20210123,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia', '*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia: registry/incidence', '*clinical research/practice', '*liver transplantation/hepatology', '*liver transplantation: auxiliary', '*liver transplantation: living donor', '*organ transplantation in general']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/31 08:37'],"['2020/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/31 08:37 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajt.16476 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2021 May;21(5):1953-1958. doi: 10.1111/ajt.16476.

METHODS: The expressions of MALAT1, miR-146a and CXCR4 were performed by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. We conducted trans-well assay, CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry to evaluate the migration, proliferation and apoptosis of AML cells. Also by using luciferase reporter assay, we investigated the interaction between miR-146a and MALAT1 or CXCR4. RESULTS: Firstly, MALAT1 and CXCR4 were upregulated while miR-146a was downregulated in AML patients compared with healthy controls. We observed a negative correlation between miR-146a and MALAT1 or CXCR4, but a positive correlation between MALAT1 and CXCR4 in AML patients. MALAT1 knockdown inhibited migration and proliferation but induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. MALAT1 restrained miR-146a expression by acting as a ceRNA. miR-146a regulated HL-60 cells migration, proliferation and apoptosis by directly targeting CXCR4 expression. Finally, we found that CXCR4 expression was downregulated by MALAT1 knockdown and partially restored by miR-146a abrogation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that MALAT1 regulates migration, proliferation and apoptosis by sponging miR-146a to regulate CXCR4 expression in AML cells, providing novel insights into the role of MALAT1 as a therapeutic target in AML.","['Sheng, Xian-Fu', 'Hong, Li-Li', 'Li, Hui', 'Huang, Fei-Yan', 'Wen, Qiang', 'Zhuang, Hai-Feng']","['Sheng XF', 'Hong LL', 'Li H', 'Huang FY', 'Wen Q', 'Zhuang HF']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7317-965X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7795-8223', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7467-4823', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4203-0534', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3303-3389', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2802-7910']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CXCR4', 'HL-60 cells', 'MALAT1', 'competing endogenous RNAs', 'lncRNAs', 'miR-146a', 'regulate']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/12/31 08:36'],"['2020/12/31 08:36 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1867781 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):43-52. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1867781.,20210510,,"[""The department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""The department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""The department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""The department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""The department of Cancer, Cancer Hospital of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""The department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (MALAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, >70% of adult survivors do not meet survivorship dietary recommendations. ALL treatment may amplify risk for restricted dietary preferences (picky eating) and poor self-regulation of food intake that could contribute to suboptimal diets in survivorship. This study aims to: (a) characterize differences in picky eating and self-regulation of food intake between survivors and peer controls; and (b) examine the associations between these eating behaviors and dietary quality in ALL survivors relative to peer controls. METHODS: Participants were children (5-13 years) with (n = 32) and without (n = 32) a history of ALL and their caregivers. Children's dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index-2015) was calculated from 24-h dietary recalls. Caregivers completed the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire-Food Fussiness subscale and the Child Self-Regulation in Eating Questionnaire. RESULTS: Independent samples t-tests revealed survivors exhibited greater picky eating than peer controls but comparable self-regulation of food intake. Bootstrapped grouped multivariate regression results showed that for ALL survivors, greater picky eating was associated with worse dietary quality (controlling for age and self-regulation of food intake). For peer controls, worse self-regulation of food intake was associated with poorer dietary quality (controlling for picky eating and age). CONCLUSIONS: Results provide preliminary support that different eating behaviors contribute to poor dietary quality in children with and without an ALL history. These findings suggest that interventions to improve ALL survivors' dietary quality may benefit targeting picky eating.","['Chardon, Marie L', 'Pinto, Stefania', 'Slayton, William B', 'Fisher, Rachel S', 'Janicke, David M']","['Chardon ML', 'Pinto S', 'Slayton WB', 'Fisher RS', 'Janicke DM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9128-1009', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6514-5492']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201231,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*dietary intake', '*eating behaviors']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2020/12/31 05:29'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/31 05:29 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28811 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Apr;68(4):e28811. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28811.

However, significant prognostic values of CXCR members in acute myeloid leukemia are yet to be explored profoundly. In this study, we firstly made an analysis of the relationship of CXCR family members and AML using samples from TCGA. Our results suggested that transcriptional expressions of CXCRs serve an important role in AML. CXCR transcript expressions, except CXCR1 expression, were significantly increased in AML. It displayed the expression pattern of CXCR members in different AML subtypes according to FAB classification. The correlations of CXCR transcript expression with different genotypes and karyotypes were also present. High CXCR2 expression was found to have a significantly worse prognosis compared with that of low CXCR2 expression, and CXCR2 was also found to be an independent prognostic factor. We also established a CXCR signature to identify high-risk subgroups of patients with AML. It was an independent prognostic factor and could become a powerful method to predict the survival rate of patients.","['Lu, Cong', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'Chen, Xiangjun', 'Hu, Yanjie', 'Xie, Wei', 'Yao, Junxia', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Lu C', 'Zhu J', 'Chen X', 'Hu Y', 'Xie W', 'Yao J', 'Huang S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201030,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXC chemokine receptor', 'FAB subtypes', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene signature', 'prognostic role', 'risk stratification']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:26'],"['2020/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.584766 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 30;10:584766. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.584766. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Lu, Zhu, Chen, Hu, Xie, Yao and Huang.']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Biological Targeted Therapy Key Laboratory in Hubei, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Biological Targeted Therapy Key Laboratory in Hubei, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Biological Targeted Therapy Key Laboratory in Hubei, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Biological Targeted Therapy Key Laboratory in Hubei, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Biological Targeted Therapy Key Laboratory in Hubei, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Biological Targeted Therapy Key Laboratory in Hubei, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Biological Targeted Therapy Key Laboratory in Hubei, Wuhan, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7769120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent advances concerning disease treatment, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the first line of treatment in several countries, and the modifications induced by such drugs in the organism are still poorly understood. In this context, the present study provided a comparative high-throughput proteomic analysis of the cumulative changes induced by chemotherapeutic drugs used in the induction phase of B-ALL treatment in both peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow compartment (BM) samples. To reach this goal, PB and BM plasma samples were comparatively analyzed by using label-free proteomics at two endpoints: at diagnosis (D0) and the end of the cumulative induction phase treatment (D28). Proteomic data was available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021584. The resulting differentially expressed proteins were explored by bioinformatics approaches aiming to identify the main gene ontology processes, pathways, and transcription factors altered by chemotherapy, as well as to understand B-ALL biology in each compartment at D0. At D0, PB was characterized as a pro-inflammatory environment, with the involvement of several downregulated coagulation proteins as KNG, plasmin, and plasminogen. D28 was characterized predominantly by immune response-related processes and the super expression of the transcription factor IRF3 and transthyretin. RUNX1 was pointed out as a common transcription factor found in both D0 and D28. We chose to validate the proteins transthyretin and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by commercial kits and expressed the results as PB/BM ratios. Transthyretin ratio was augmented after induction chemotherapy, while IFN-gamma was reduced at the end of the treatment. Considering that most of these proteins were not yet described in B-ALL literature, these findings added to understanding disease biology at diagnosis and highlighted a possible role for transthyretin and IFN-gamma as mechanisms related to disease resolution.","['Broto, Geise Ellen', 'Correa, Stephany', 'Trigo, Fausto Celso', 'Dos Santos, Everton Cruz', 'Tomiotto-Pelissier, Fernanda', 'Pavanelli, Wander Rogerio', 'Silveira, Guilherme Ferreira', 'Abdelhay, Eliana', 'Panis, Carolina']","['Broto GE', 'Correa S', 'Trigo FC', 'Dos Santos EC', 'Tomiotto-Pelissier F', 'Pavanelli WR', 'Silveira GF', 'Abdelhay E', 'Panis C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201214,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'interferon regulatory factor 3', 'interferon-gamma', 'proteomics', 'transthyretin', 'tumor biology']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:26'],"['2020/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.550213 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 14;10:550213. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.550213. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Broto, Correa, Trigo, Santos, Tomiotto-Pelissier, Pavanelli,', 'Silveira, Abdelhay and Panis.']","['Programa de Pos-graduacao em Patologia Clinica e Laboratorial, Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia de Tumores, Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana, UNIOESTE, Francisco Beltrao, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Celulas-Tronco, Centro de Transplante de Medula Ossea (CEMO), Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatrics Department, Hospital do Cancer de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Celulas-Tronco, Centro de Transplante de Medula Ossea (CEMO), Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Patologia Experimental Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Patologia Experimental Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Osvaldo Cruz, Instituto Carlos Chagas, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Celulas-Tronco, Centro de Transplante de Medula Ossea (CEMO), Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Patologia Clinica e Laboratorial, Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia de Tumores, Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana, UNIOESTE, Francisco Beltrao, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Patologia Experimental Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Aplicadas a Saude, Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana, UNIOESTE, Francisco Beltrao, Brazil.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7769010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocations are found in a majority of pPCL cases, supporting a central relation to pathogenesis of pPCL. However, two independent IgH translocations are barely detected at the onset of pPCL, and their significance is yet to be elucidated. Here, we report a case of an aggressive pPCL with simultaneous IGH/MYC and IGH/CCND1 translocations. A 73-year-old man was referred to our hospital with back pain and diagnosed as having pPCL with more than 50% circulating plasma cells. Cytogenetic analysis revealed 47, Y, t (X; 8;14) (q24; q24; q32), t (11; 14) (q13; q32), and +18. IGH/MYC and IGH/CCND1 translocations were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Bortezomib and dexamethasone treatment achieved rapid elimination of peripheral malignant plasma cells, and the patient maintained a partial response for 18 months. After biological relapse, he received salvage therapy with ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, followed by pomalidomide and dexamethasone, and exhibited stable disease for an additional 14 months. Although IGH/MYC translocation in association with dysregulation of antiapoptotic pathway leads to worse prognosis in lymphomas, the novel agent-based regimen showed good efficacy, suggesting that IGH/MYC plays a different role in the pathogenesis of MM. IGH/CCND1 and IGH/MYC translocations may have contributed to abrupt onset of pPCL in this case.","['Yasumi, Masato', 'Endo, Takaya', 'Sata, Hiroshi', 'Karasuno, Takahiro']","['Yasumi M', 'Endo T', 'Sata H', 'Karasuno T']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0320-4685'],['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201218,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:26'],"['2020/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8811114 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2020 Dec 18;2020:8811114. doi: 10.1155/2020/8811114. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Masato Yasumi et al.'],"['Department of Hematology, Rinku General Medical Center, Izumisano, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rinku General Medical Center, Izumisano, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Daini Osaka Police Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rinku General Medical Center, Izumisano, Japan.']",,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7762630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mouse fetal liver are highly expanded to prepare for mobilization of HSCs into the fetal bone marrow. It is not completely known how the fetal liver niche regulates HSC expansion without loss of self-renewal ability. We reviewed current progress about the effects of fetal liver niche, chemokine, cytokine, and signaling pathways on HSC self-renewal, proliferation, and expansion. We discussed the molecular regulations of fetal HSC expansion in mouse and zebrafish. It is also unknown how HSCs from the fetal liver mobilize, circulate, and reside into the fetal bone marrow niche. We reviewed how extrinsic and intrinsic factors regulate mobilization of fetal liver HSCs into the fetal bone marrow, which provides tools to improve HSC engraftment efficiency during HSC transplantation. Understanding the regulation of fetal liver HSC mobilization into the fetal bone marrow will help us to design proper clinical therapeutic protocol for disease treatment like leukemia during pregnancy. We prospect that fetal cells, including hepatocytes and endothelial and hematopoietic cells, might regulate fetal liver HSC expansion. Components from vascular endothelial cells and bones might also modulate the lodging of fetal liver HSCs into the bone marrow. The current review holds great potential to deeply understand the molecular regulations of HSCs in the fetal liver and bone marrow in mammals, which will be helpful to efficiently expand HSCs in vitro.","['Zeng, Huihong', 'Cheng, Jiaoqi', 'Fan, Ying', 'Luan, Yingying', 'Yang, Juan', 'Wang, Feixuan', 'Yang, Shuo', 'Shao, Lijian']","['Zeng H', 'Cheng J', 'Fan Y', 'Luan Y', 'Yang J', 'Wang F', 'Yang S', 'Shao L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7000-7094'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201215,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:25'],"['2020/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:25 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8885154 [doi]'],epublish,Stem Cells Int. 2020 Dec 15;2020:8885154. doi: 10.1155/2020/8885154. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Huihong Zeng et al.'],"['Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.', 'Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China 330006.']",,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7755487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RS genomic landscape shares only a few features with de novo DLBCLs and is marked by a wide spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities. Little is known about RS microenvironment. Therapeutic options and efficacy are limited, leading to a 12 months median overall survival. The new targeted treatments usually effective in CLL fail to obtain long-term remissions in RS. Methods: We reviewed available PubMed literature about RS genomics, PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed Death 1/Programmed Death Ligand 1) pathway triggering and subsequent new therapeutic options. Results: Data from about 207 patients from four landmark papers were compiled to build an overview of RS genomic lesions and point mutations. A number of these abnormalities may be involved in tumor microenvironment reshaping. T lymphocyte exhaustion through PD-L1 overexpression by tumor cells and subsequent PD-1/PD-L1 pathway triggering is frequently reported in solid cancers. This immune checkpoint inhibitor is also described in B lymphoid malignancies, particularly CLL: PD-1 expression is reported in a subset of prolymphocytes from the CLL lymph node proliferation centers. However, there is only few data about PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in RS. In RS, PD-1 expression is a hallmark of recently described << Regulatory B-cells >>, which interact with tumor microenvironment by producing inhibiting cytokines such as TGF-beta and IL-10, impairing T lymphocytes anti-tumoral function. Based upon the discovery of high PD-1 expression on tumoral B lymphocyte from RS, immune checkpoint blockade therapies such as anti-PD-1 antibodies have been tested on small RS cohorts and provided heterogeneous but encouraging results. Conclusion: RS genetic landscape and immune evasion mechanisms are being progressively unraveled. New protocols using targeted treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors as single agents or in combination with immunochemotherapy are currently being evaluated.","['Auge, Helene', 'Notarantonio, Anne-Beatrice', 'Morizot, Romain', 'Quinquenel, Anne', 'Fornecker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Hergalant, Sebastien', 'Feugier, Pierre', 'Broseus, Julien']","['Auge H', 'Notarantonio AB', 'Morizot R', 'Quinquenel A', 'Fornecker LM', 'Hergalant S', 'Feugier P', 'Broseus J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201214,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Richter syndrome', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', '*genomics', '*immune checkpoint', '*immune checkpoint inhibitor', '*microenvironment']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/31 05:25'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:25 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.594841 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Dec 14;11:594841. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.594841. eCollection 2020.,20210617,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Auge, Notarantonio, Morizot, Quinquenel, Fornecker, Hergalant,', 'Feugier and Broseus.']","['Inserm UMRS1256 Nutrition-Genetique et Exposition aux Risque Environnementaux (N-GERE), Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', ""Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, service d'hematologie clinique, pole specialites medicales, Nancy, France."", ""Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, service d'hematologie clinique, pole specialites medicales, Nancy, France."", 'UMR7365 Ingenierie Moleculaire et Physiopathologie Articulaire (IMOPA), CNRS, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', 'Inserm UMRS1256 Nutrition-Genetique et Exposition aux Risque Environnementaux (N-GERE), Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', ""Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, service d'hematologie clinique, pole specialites medicales, Nancy, France."", ""Departement d'hematologie, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France."", ""Departement d'hematologie clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Reims, Reims, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC/UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', ""Departement d'hematologie clinique, Institut de Cancerologie Strasbourg Europe, Strasbourg, France."", 'Inserm UMRS1256 Nutrition-Genetique et Exposition aux Risque Environnementaux (N-GERE), Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', 'Inserm UMRS1256 Nutrition-Genetique et Exposition aux Risque Environnementaux (N-GERE), Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', ""Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, service d'hematologie clinique, pole specialites medicales, Nancy, France."", 'Inserm UMRS1256 Nutrition-Genetique et Exposition aux Risque Environnementaux (N-GERE), Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', ""Universite de Lorraine, CHRU-Nancy, service d'hematologie biologique, pole laboratoires, Nancy, France.""]",['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],"['Female', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology']","['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7767850,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This literature review revealed that only 10 countries have reported the mean concentrations of IM in GISTs or CML patients and the clinical outcomes in different ethnic groups and populations. There were totally 24 different gene polymorphisms, which were examined for any potential influence on the steady-state plasma concentration of IM. As a result, some genotype locus made discrepant conclusion. Herein, the more sample capacity, multicenter, long-term study was worthy to carry out. Eleven reports were enumerated on clinical drug interactions with IM, while there is not sufficient information on the pharmacokinetic parameters altered by drug combinations with IM that could help in investigating the actual drug interactions.

This explains the two major classes of BCL-2 proteins which are anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins. The anti-apoptotic proteins are attractive targets for BCL-2 family inhibitors, which result in the augmentation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BCL-2 family inhibitors have been studied extensively for novel targeted therapies in various cancer types, fibrotic diseases, aging-related as well as autoimmune diseases. Navitoclax is one of them and it has been discovered to have a high affinity toward BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins, including BCL-2, BCL-W and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large. Navitoclax has been demonstrated as a single agent or in combination with other drugs to successfully ameliorate tumor progression and fibrosis development. To date, navitoclax has entered phase I and phase II clinical studies. Navitoclax alone potently treats small cell lung cancer and acute lymphocytic leukemia, whilst in combination therapy for solid tumors, it enhances the therapeutic effect of other chemotherapeutic agents. A low platelet count has always associated with single navitoclax treatments, though this effect is tolerable. Moreover, the efficacy of navitoclax is determined by the expression of several BCL-2 family members. Here, we elucidate the complex mechanisms of navitoclax as a pro-apoptotic agent, and review the early and current clinical studies of navitoclax alone as well as with other drugs. Additionally, some suggestions on the development of navitoclax clinical studies are presented in the future prospects section.","['Mohamad Anuar, Nur Najmi', 'Nor Hisam, Nur Syahidah', 'Liew, Sze Ling', 'Ugusman, Azizah']","['Mohamad Anuar NN', 'Nor Hisam NS', 'Liew SL', 'Ugusman A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201126,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', 'anti-cancer agent', 'apoptosis', 'cancer', 'fibrosis', 'navitoclax (ABT-263)']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:24'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:24 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2020.564108 [doi]', '564108 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Nov 26;11:564108. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.564108. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Mohamad Anuar, Ugusman, Nor Hisam and Liew.']","['Programme of Biomedical Science, Centre for Toxicology & Health Risk Studies, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Programme of Biomedical Science, Centre for Toxicology & Health Risk Studies, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Programme of Biomedical Science, Centre for Toxicology & Health Risk Studies, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Cheras, Malaysia.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7768911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biologic heterogeneity of cll between patients results in variable disease trajectories and responses to therapy. Notably, compared with patients lacking high-risk features, those with such features-such as deletions in chromosome 17p, aberrations in the TP53 gene, or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes-experience inferior outcomes and responses to standard chemoimmunotherapy. Novel agents that target the B cell receptor signalling pathway, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (btk) inhibitors, have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in patients with treatment-naive cll, particularly those with high-risk features. However, given the current lack of head-to-head trials comparing btk inhibitors, selection of the optimal btk inhibitor for patients with cll is unclear and requires consideration of multiple factors. In the present review, we focus on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacologic features of the btk inhibitors that are approved or under clinical development, and we discuss the practical considerations for the use of those agents in the Canadian treatment landscape.","['Banerji, V', 'Aw, A', 'Robinson, S', 'Doucette, S', 'Christofides, A', 'Sehn, L H']","['Banerji V', 'Aw A', 'Robinson S', 'Doucette S', 'Christofides A', 'Sehn LH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201201,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*first-line therapy', '*frontline therapy', '*untreated disease']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2020/12/31 05:24'],"['2020/12/31 05:24 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.27.6795 [doi]', 'conc-27-e645 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2020 Dec;27(6):e645-e655. doi: 10.3747/co.27.6795.

This is an extremely rare disease with poor prognosis, owing to resistance to various treatments. We describe a 33-year-old man with intractable CLL with CNS involvement. He was diagnosed with CLL, with diplopia as the first manifestation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a contrast-enhancing tumor in the right temporal lobe, which was diagnosed as CNS involvement in CLL on brain biopsy. High-dose methotrexate therapy was ineffective for this lesion, which was also resistant to subsequent whole-brain irradiation, treatment with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab chemoimmunotherapy, and ibrutinib administration. Because no standard protocol exists for CLL with CNS involvement, it is important to accumulate case data to verify the choice of new drugs for administration at an early stage. Therefore, we also conducted a literature review of 50 case reports of CNS lesions in the last 10 years to consider the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CNS involvement in CLL. The possibility of new therapeutic agents, eg, ibrutinib and venetoclax, or a combination of these agents and methotrexate, can be envisioned as a treatment strategy for CLL with CNS involvement.","['Nakanishi, Takahisa', 'Ito, Tomoki', 'Fujita, Shinya', 'Satake, Atsushi', 'Konishi, Akiko', 'Hotta, Masaaki', 'Yoshimura, Hideaki', 'Nomura, Shosaku']","['Nakanishi T', 'Ito T', 'Fujita S', 'Satake A', 'Konishi A', 'Hotta M', 'Yoshimura H', 'Nomura S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5419-9156', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6007-6264', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2593-6174']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201223,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,['NOTNLM'],"['central nervous system involvement', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'literature review']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:23'],"['2020/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:23 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S271335 [doi]', '271335 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2020 Dec 23;11:487-502. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S271335. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Nakanishi et al.'],"['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,PMC7767717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal here was to probe the functional mechanism of ZNF667-AS1 in AML by mediating microRNA-206 (miR-206)/A-kinase anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13) axis. Materials and Methods: The bone marrow samples from AML patients and controls were selected for microarray analysis to select significantly upregulated lncRNAs. Next, effects of ZNF667-AS1 on cell aggressiveness of AML were assessed after delivery of cells with siRNA against ZNF667-AS1. Subcellular fractionation location assay and FISH experiments were used to determine ZNF667-AS1 localization in cells. Dual-luciferase experiments detect the targeting relationships among ZNF667-AS1, miR-206 and AKAP13. Finally, tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated in vivo to determine the relevance of ZNF667-AS1/miR-206/AKAP13 axis. Results: The expression of ZNF667-AS1 was upregulated in AML patients, which predicted poor prognosis. Downregulation of ZNF667-AS1 reduced cell proliferation, invasion, tumorigenesis and metastasis. miR-206 inhibitor reversed the repressive role of ZNF667-AS1 knockdown in cell proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis, while AKAP13 silencing flattened the stimulative role of miR-206 inhibitor in AML malignant aggressiveness. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that ZNF667-AS1 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-206. In addition, we observed that Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was suppressed by ZNF667-AS1 knockdown. Conclusion: ZNF667-AS1 potentiated AML progression by targeting the miR-206/AKAP13 axis. This indicates ZNF667-AS 1 inhibition may act as a prospective therapeutic option for the treatment of AML.","['Wang, Nan', 'Feng, Yanping', 'Xie, Jinye', 'Han, Hui', 'Dong, Qian', 'Wang, Weijia']","['Wang N', 'Feng Y', 'Xie J', 'Han H', 'Dong Q', 'Wang W']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKAP13', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'long non-coding RNA ZNF667-AS1', 'microRNA-206']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:23'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:23 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S269258 [doi]', '269258 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Dec 23;12:13285-13300. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S269258. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],"[""Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan, 528403 Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan, 528403 Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan, 528403 Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan, 528403 Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan, 528403 Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Zhongshan People's Hospital, Zhongshan, 528403 Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""]",,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7767707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the increased use of rituximab as well as other selective and non-selective immunomodulatory agents, the incidence of infectious complications and second malignancies has also increased. Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is a complication of rituximab in HIV-negative patients. A 56-year-old male with CLL had been treated and relapsed four times in 6 years. Rituximab was added to the combination after the second relapse and repeated in the third relapse in combination with bendamustine. In the seventh year of diagnosis, relapse of CLL and an ulcerated tumorous lesion was observed in the left index finger, which progressed in 3 months and was later diagnosed as angiosarcoma. The cancer was treated with local radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy. One year after the last rituximab exposure, progressive muscle weakness developed and polyoma JC virus DNA was observed with increased titres in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the patient was diagnosed as having PML. The patient died 2 months later. Our patient had an unusual course of CLL over 8 years, with relapses, complicated with a secondary malignancy and an infectious complication.","['Umit, Elif G', 'Baysal, Mehmet', 'Ozdover, Ali Caner', 'Kirkizlar, Onur', 'Demir, Ahmet Muzaffer']","['Umit EG', 'Baysal M', 'Ozdover AC', 'Kirkizlar O', 'Demir AM']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,IM,,,2021/01/01 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/12/31 05:20'],"['2020/12/31 05:20 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['NatlMedJIndia_2019_32_6_347_303614 [pii]', '10.4103/0970-258X.303614 [doi]']",ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2019 Nov-Dec;32(6):347-349. doi: 10.4103/0970-258X.303614.,20210927,,"['Faculty of Medicine, Trakya University, Balkan Yerleskesi 22030, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Trakya University, Balkan Yerleskesi 22030, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Trakya University, Balkan Yerleskesi 22030, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Trakya University, Balkan Yerleskesi 22030, Edirne, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Trakya University, Balkan Yerleskesi 22030, Edirne, Turkey.']",,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chemoradiotherapy/*methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology/*therapy', 'Plasmapheresis', 'Radiation Tolerance']",['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modified treatments derived from the LSA2-L2 regimen resulted in encouraging survival, but toxicities and long-term sequelae have been problematic. At present, the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type protocol has demonstrated efficacy in LBL. We analyzed the outcomes of children and adolescents with LBL treated with various regimens. Methods: From 19912018, this study enrolled 63 patients diagnosed with LBL at Asan Medical Center. Medical records were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among 63 patients, most patients (38.1%) presented with stage IV at diagnosis, and two had central nervous system (CNS) involvement. At a median follow-up of 160 months, the 5-year event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and relapse free survival (RFS) were 68.8%, 79.3%, and 71.3%, respectively. Among 61 patients who received chemotherapy, 27 patients (44.3%) received the NY protocol, and 14 (23.0%) received the ALL-type protocol. There was no significant difference in 5-yr OS (85.2%/78.6%), EFS (73.5%/78.6%), and RFS (73.5%/78.6%) between the NY and ALL protocol groups, regardless of immunophenotype. Thirteen patients (21.3%) received prophylactic cranial radiotherapy with no difference in the incidence of CNS relapse based on irradiation. Conclusion: This study showed no difference in outcome between the NY and ALL-type protocols, regardless of stage or immunophenotype. In addition to improving the effectiveness of treatment, it is necessary to continuously appraise the appropriate chemotherapy regimen, considering toxicities and long-term prognosis, for pediatric LBL.","['Choi, Ho Jung', 'Shin, Juhee', 'Kang, Sunghan', 'Suh, Jin Kyung', 'Kim, Hyery', 'Koh, Kyung-Nam', 'Im, Ho Joon']","['Choi HJ', 'Shin J', 'Kang S', 'Suh JK', 'Kim H', 'Koh KN', 'Im HJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Child', 'Lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'New York protocol', 'Survival']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 05:20'],"['2020/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 05:20 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['br.2020.2020220 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2020.2020220 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2020 Dec 31;55(4):262-274. doi: 10.5045/br.2020.2020220.,,,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,PMC7784128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the high patient variability of disease dynamics, risk-scoring is an important part of its clinical management. AML is characterized by impaired blood cell formation and the accumulation of so-called leukemic blasts in the bone marrow of patients. Recently, it has been proposed to use counts of blood-producing (hematopoietic) stem cells (HSCs) as a biomarker for patient prognosis. In this work, we use a non-linear mathematical model to provide mechanistic evidence for the suitability of HSC counts as a prognostic marker. Using model analysis and computer simulations, we compare different risk-scores involving HSC quantification.

Many plants are used in diverse external and internal formulations (infusions, alcoholic extracts, essential oils (EOs), etc.) in the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases, such as those affecting the respiratory tract or causing gastrointestinal or joint problems, among others. To support the traditional uses of plant extracts, EOs have been assessed for their alleged anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of EOs on the release of cytokines and chemokines has been much less reported. Considering their traditional use and commercial relevance in Portugal and Angola, this study evaluated the effect of EOs on the in vitro inhibition of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells). Twenty EOs extracted from eighteen species from seven families, namely from Amaranthaceae (Dysphania ambrosioides), Apiaceae (Foeniculum vulgare), Asteraceae (Brachylaena huillensis, Solidago virgaurea), Euphorbiaceae (Spirostachys africana), Lamiaceae (Lavandula luisieri, Mentha cervina, Origanum majorana, Satureja montana, Thymbra capitata, Thymus mastichina, Thymus vulgaris, Thymus zygis subsp. zygis), Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus globulus subsp. maidenii, Eucalyptus radiata, Eucalyptus viminalis) and Pinaceae (Pinus pinaster) were assayed for the release of CCL2 and TNF-alpha by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. B. huillensis, S. africana, S. montana, Th. mastichina and Th. vulgaris EOs showed toxicity to THP-1 cells, at the lowest concentration tested (10 mug/mL), using the tetrazolium dye assay. The most active EOs in reducing TNF-alpha release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were those of T. capitata (51% inhibition at 20 mug/mL) and L. luisieri (15-23% inhibition at 30 mug/mL and 78-83% inhibition at 90 mug/mL). L. luisieri EO induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CCL2 release by LPSstimulated THP-1 cells (23%, 54% and 82% inhibition at 10, 30 and 90 mug/mL, respectively). These EOs are potentially useful in the management of inflammatory diseases mediated by CCL2 and TNFalpha, such as atherosclerosis and arthritis.","['Miguel, Maria Graca', 'da Silva, Carina Isabel', 'Farah, Luana', 'Castro Braga, Fernao', 'Figueiredo, Ana Cristina']","['Miguel MG', 'da Silva CI', 'Farah L', 'Castro Braga F', 'Figueiredo AC']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2507-4228', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9468-376X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3239-3190']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201228,Switzerland,Plants (Basel),"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",101596181,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemokine', 'cytokine', 'essential oils', 'inflammation']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:01,['2020/12/31 01:03'],"['2020/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['plants10010050 [pii]', '10.3390/plants10010050 [doi]']",epublish,Plants (Basel). 2020 Dec 28;10(1). pii: plants10010050. doi: 10.3390/plants10010050.,,,"['Mediterranean Institute for Agriculture, Environment and Development (MED), Departamento de Quimica e Farmacia, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal.', 'Mediterranean Institute for Agriculture, Environment and Development (MED), Departamento de Quimica e Farmacia, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal.', 'Departamento de Produtos Farmaceuticos, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Av.

Recently, we have shown that cannabidiol kills the cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by a direct interaction with mitochondria, with their consequent dysfunction. In the present study, cytotoxic effects of several phenolic compounds against human the T-ALL cell line Jurkat were tested by means of resazurin-based metabolic assay. To unravel underlying mechanisms, mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim) and [Ca(2+)]m measurements were undertaken, and reactive oxygen species generation and cell death were evaluated by flow cytometry. Three out of eight tested phenolics, cannabidiol, curcumin and quercetin, which displayed a significant cytotoxic effect, also dissipated the Psim and induced a significant [Ca(2+)]m increase, whereas inefficient phenols did not. Dissipation of the Psim by cannabidiol was prevented by cyclosporine A and reverted by Ru360, inhibitors of the permeation transition pore and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter, respectively. Ru360 prevented the phenol-induced [Ca(2+)]m rise, but neither cyclosporine A nor Ru360 affected the curcumin- and quercetin-induced Psim depolarization. Ru360 impeded the curcumin- and cannabidiol-induced cell death. Thus, all three phenols exert their antileukemic activity via mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, whereas curcumin and quercetin suppress the metabolism of leukemic cells by direct mitochondrial uncoupling.","['Olivas-Aguirre, Miguel', 'Torres-Lopez, Liliana', 'Pottosin, Igor', 'Dobrovinskaya, Oxana']","['Olivas-Aguirre M', 'Torres-Lopez L', 'Pottosin I', 'Dobrovinskaya O']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4832-128X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1424-1596', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9657-9226']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20201228,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cannabidiol', 'curcumin', 'cytotoxicity', 'mitochondria', 'quercetin']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/12/31 01:02'],"['2020/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010204 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010204 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 28;22(1). pii: ijms22010204. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010204.,20210907,,"['Laboratory of Immunobiology and Ionic Transport Regulation, Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Av. 25 de Julio 965, Villa de San Sebastian, 28045 Colima, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology and Ionic Transport Regulation, Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Av. 25 de Julio 965, Villa de San Sebastian, 28045 Colima, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology and Ionic Transport Regulation, Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Av. 25 de Julio 965, Villa de San Sebastian, 28045 Colima, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology and Ionic Transport Regulation, Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Av. 25 de Julio 965, Villa de San Sebastian, 28045 Colima, Mexico.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '19GBJ60SN5 (Cannabidiol)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cannabidiol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Curcumin/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,"['CF 21887/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia', '303072/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia']",PMC7795267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, an innovative fluorescence biosensing methodology has been developed for sensitive and specific detection of BCR-ABL1 mRNA by integrating high-efficiency of exponential transcription and superior catalytic performance of DNA-grafted hemin. Exponential transcription was triggered by BCR-ABL1 mRNA to produce plenty of RNA products. They can specifically hybridize with circular dual-labeled hemin (DLH) probe to dissociate the intramolecular hemin dimmers into highly active hemin monomers for catalyzing fluorescence substrate tyramine. This exponential transcription-triggered hemin catalysis (ET-HC) strategy showed highly sensitive and specific for BCR-ABL1 detection with a limit of detection at 0.5 aM and a good linear range from 2 aM to 200 fM. This method was successfully applied to directly detect as low as 0.001% e13a2 transcript isoforms from complex genomic RNA extraction. Compared with clinical routine, the overall process is a thermostatic reaction and eliminates additional reverse transcription operation. Therefore, the developed ET-HC strategy might provide a promising alternative tool for precise diagnosis and personalized treatment of CML.","['Kang, Lina', 'Duan, Jiaxin', 'He, Fang', 'Teng, Jie', 'Li, Jia', 'Yang, Tiantian', 'Luo, Nini', 'Zhao, Jie', 'Ding, Shijia', 'Cheng, Wei']","['Kang L', 'Duan J', 'He F', 'Teng J', 'Li J', 'Yang T', 'Luo N', 'Zhao J', 'Ding S', 'Cheng W']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201203,Netherlands,Talanta,Talanta,2984816R,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 fusion gene', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Exponential transcription', 'Fluorescence biosensing', 'Hemin-mimetic enzymes']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/31 01:01'],"['2020/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0039-9140(20)31258-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121967 [doi]']",ppublish,Talanta. 2021 Mar 1;224:121967. doi: 10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121967.

A mathematical model based on biological mechanisms and basic cell descriptors such as proliferation rates and apoptosis rates is suggested, connecting stem cell dynamics with mature blood cells and immune mediated feedback. The flexible approach allows for arbitrary numbers of mutated stem cell clones with perturbed properties. In particular, the stem cell niche provides a competition between wild type and mutated stem cells. Hence, the stem cell niche can mediate suppression of the wild type clones and up-regulation of one or more malignant clones. The model is parameterized using clinical data to show typical disease progression in several blood cancers and the hematological and molecular response to treatment. Intriguingly, occasional oscillatory cell counts observed during treatment of CML and MPNs can be explained by heterogeneous stem cell clone dynamics. Thus, the vital heterogeneous stem cell dynamics may be inferred from mathematical modeling in synergy with clinical data to elucidate hematopoiesis, blood cancers and the outcome of interventions.","['Bangsgaard, Katrine O', 'Andersen, Morten', 'Skov, Vibe', 'Kjaer, Lasse', 'Hasselbalch, Hans C', 'Ottesen, Johnny T']","['Bangsgaard KO', 'Andersen M', 'Skov V', 'Kjaer L', 'Hasselbalch HC', 'Ottesen JT']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Math Biosci Eng,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['* blood cancer', '* competition dynamics', '* hematopoiesis', '* inflammation', '* mathematical modeling', '* stem cell dynamics']",2021/01/01 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/12/31 01:00'],"['2020/12/31 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3934/mbe.2020389 [doi]'],ppublish,Math Biosci Eng. 2020 Nov 4;17(6):7645-7670. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2020389.,20210526,,"['IMFUFA, Department of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Roskildevej 1, DK 4000, Denmark.', 'IMFUFA, Department of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Roskildevej 1, DK 4000, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Sygehusvej 10, DK 4000, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Sygehusvej 10, DK 4000, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Sygehusvej 10, DK 4000, Denmark.', 'IMFUFA, Department of Science and Environment, Roskilde University, Roskildevej 1, DK 4000, Denmark.']",,"['Clone Cells', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Models, Biological', 'Models, Theoretical']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical studies have reported rhythmic fluctuations in allergic diseases. The search for natural and harmless active ingredients based on biological rhythm with which to regulate allergic diseases is essential for the control of food allergy. METHODS: In this study, mice were treated at different time points to determine the link between the severity of allergic reactions and the circadian clock genes. The mice were treated with lentinan, either continuously or discontinuously, to assess their clinical symptoms, vascular permeability, immune cells, cytokines, and clock genes. Specifically, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were treated with lentinan and the rhythmic changes of cell degranulation were measured. RESULTS: The results in different models showed that the allergic reactions in mice treated at different time points were significantly different and thus related to fluctuations in biological rhythm. Treatment with lentinan was found to reduce the amplitude of changes in the clock genes, such as the activation of Per and Cry proteins in allergic mice, as well as to regulate biological rhythm in cells, inhibit the activation of Th2 cells, and alleviate allergic reactions. Furthermore, lentinan changed the rhythm of degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. CONCLUSION: Lentinan was, therefore, determined to successfully alleviate allergic reactions by reducing the amplitude of changes in the body's biological rhythm, inhibiting the activation of Th2 cells, and affecting the immune microenvironment.","['Yang, Shuai', 'Chew, Huifang', 'Jiang, Yuchi', 'Cheng, Lei', 'Guo, Xiaoya', 'Che, Huilian', 'Sun, Na']","['Yang S', 'Chew H', 'Jiang Y', 'Cheng L', 'Guo X', 'Che H', 'Sun N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201230,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allergy', '*Biological rhythm', '*Lentinan', '*Murine model', '*Th2 cells']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2020/12/30 20:06'],"['2020/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/30 20:06 [entrez]']","['000509437 [pii]', '10.1159/000509437 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2021;182(3):167-181. doi: 10.1159/000509437.

Here, we systematically inactivate DUBs in mouse hematopoietic progenitors using in vivo small hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens. We find that multiple DUBs may be individually required for hematopoiesis and identify ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as essential for HSC maintenance in vitro and in transplantations and Usp15 knockout (KO) mice in vivo. USP15 is highly expressed in human hematopoietic tissues and leukemias. USP15 depletion in murine progenitors and leukemia cells impairs in vitro expansion and increases genotoxic stress. In leukemia cells, USP15 interacts with and stabilizes FUS (fused in sarcoma), a known DNA repair factor, directly linking USP15 to the DNA damage response (DDR).

METHODS: A real-life cohort of 675 cases has been identified and investigated in the database of the groups participating in the study. RESULTS: At an unadjusted univariate analysis, a significant death risk reduction was observed favoring IB (IDELA-R vs IB HR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.36-0.71) although with some limitations due to the non-randomized and retrospective nature of the study and to the lower number of patients in the IDELA-R group (112 cases) related to the current prescribing practice. To overcome the potential problem of confounding by indication, we adjusted the association between the type of therapy and mortality for all variables significantly associated with OS at Cox univariate analysis. Furthermore, those variables, differently distributed between the two study groups, were introduced into the multivariate Cox model to improve the effectiveness of the analysis. By introducing all these variables into the multiple Cox regression model, we confirmed the protective effect of IB vs IDELA-R (HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.45-0.98, P = .04) independent of potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis presents some constraints, that is, the unavailability of additional potential confounders, and the retrospective nature of the study, this observation may be of help for the daily clinical practice, particularly in the absence of randomized trials comparing the two schedules.","['Morabito, Fortunato', 'Tripepi, Giovanni', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Reda, Gianluigi', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Bossio, Sabrina', 'Varettoni, Marzia', 'Murru, Roberta', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Condoluci, Adalgisa', 'Moia, Riccardo', 'Pietrasanta, Daniela', 'Loseto, Giacomo', 'Consoli, Ugo', 'Scortechini, Ilaria', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Al-Janazreh, Hamdi', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'Martino, Enrica Antonia', 'Mendicino, Francesco', 'Cassin, Ramona', ""D'Arrigo, Graziella"", 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Rago, Angela', 'Angeletti, Ilaria', 'Biagi, Annalisa', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Fronza, Gilberto', 'Monti, Paola', 'Menichini, Paola', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Jaksic, Ozren', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Foa, Robin', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Gentile, Massimo']","['Morabito F', 'Tripepi G', 'Del Poeta G', 'Mauro FR', 'Reda G', 'Sportoletti P', 'Laurenti L', 'Coscia M', 'Herishanu Y', 'Bossio S', 'Varettoni M', 'Murru R', 'Chiarenza A', 'Visentin A', 'Condoluci A', 'Moia R', 'Pietrasanta D', 'Loseto G', 'Consoli U', 'Scortechini I', 'Rossi FM', 'Zucchetto A', 'Al-Janazreh H', 'Vigna E', 'Martino EA', 'Mendicino F', 'Cassin R', ""D'Arrigo G"", 'Galimberti S', 'Rago A', 'Angeletti I', 'Biagi A', 'Del Giudice I', 'Bomben R', 'Neri A', 'Fronza G', 'Monti P', 'Menichini P', 'Cutrona G', 'Jaksic O', 'Rossi D', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Cuneo A', 'Gaidano G', 'Polliack A', 'Trentin L', 'Foa R', 'Ferrarini M', 'Gattei V', 'Gentile M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2585-7073', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4527-4131', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6830-6717', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7393-1138', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2432-235X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6864-9533', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1978-4998', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4026-285X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1222-6149', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5256-0726']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210128,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'therapy']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/12/30 17:14'],"['2020/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/30 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13573 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Apr;106(4):493-499. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13573.

Analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) data set suggests that a significant fraction of melanomas potentially harbor gain-of-function mutations in the gene that encodes for the ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase. In this work, a drug discovery strategy was developed that is based on the observation that the Q43L mutant of the naturally occurring ErbB4 agonist Neuregulin-2beta (NRG2beta) functions as a partial agonist at ErbB4. NRG2beta/Q43L stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation, fails to stimulate ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation, and inhibits agonist-induced ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation. Compounds that exhibit these characteristics likely function as ErbB4 partial agonists, and as such hold promise as therapies for ErbB4-dependent melanomas. Consequently, three highly sensitive and reproducible (Z' > 0.5) screening assays were developed and deployed for the identification of small-molecule ErbB4 partial agonists. Six compounds were identified that stimulate ErbB4 phosphorylation, fail to stimulate ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation, and appear to selectively inhibit ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation. Whereas further characterization is needed to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of these molecules, this drug discovery platform establishes reliable and scalable approaches for the discovery of ErbB4 inhibitors.","['Cullum, Richard L', 'Lucas, Lauren M', 'Senfeld, Jared I', 'Piazza, John T', 'Neel, Logan T', 'Whig, Kanupriya', 'Zhai, Ling', 'Harris, Mackenzie H', 'Rael, Cristina C', 'Taylor,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect and compare the expressions of miR-873-5p and lncRNA XIST in 8 myocardial infarction rats and 8 normal rats tissues, respectively, and the correlation between the expressions of miR-873-5p and lncRNA XIST in the myocardial tissues was explored. Next, qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the effects of upregulation of miR-873-5p and downregulation of lncRNA XIST, as well as the impacts of their interactions on the expression level of MCL1 in H9c2 cells and the apoptosis of cells. RESULTS: It was found that the downregulation of miR-873-5p protected the heart against apoptosis after AMI, and lncRNA XIST inhibited apoptosis in H9c2 cells after hypoxia. Besides, inhibiting lncRNA XIST could upregulate miR-873-5p and downregulate MCL1, thus increasing apoptosis in the H9c2 cells after hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA XIST can regulate cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting miR-873-5p.","['Cai, C-L', 'Jin, L', 'Lang, X-L', 'Li, B-L']","['Cai CL', 'Jin L', 'Lang XL', 'Li BL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,IM,,,2020/12/31 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2020/12/30 12:42'],"['2020/12/30 12:42 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202012_24191 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 Dec;24(24):12878-12886. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202012_24191.,20210630,,"['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China. caicl1000@alu.fudan.edu.cn.']","['0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (XIST non-coding RNA)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this retrospective study, the objective was set to identify the risk factors and outcome of fungal pneumonia in adult HC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted with adult (>16 years) HC patients from January 2017 and December 2018. RESULTS: During the study period, of 181 patients included 76 were diagnosed with fungal pneumonia. The most common HC was identified as acute myeloid leukaemia (40%). Of the participating patients, 52 (29%) were hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. The median age of patients with fungal pneumonia was significantly greater: 57 vs. 48 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.08) and they had longer hospitalization durations (OR: 1.14). Overall, 37 patients (20%) died, and 28-day mortality was significantly greater among patients with fungal pneumonia than without fungal pneumonia (33% vs. 11%). The most significant risk factors for mortality in fungal pneumonia were identified as need of intensive care unit (ICU) (OR: 191.2, P <0.001) and the need of vasopressor support (OR:81.6, P <0.012). ICU-mortality was (88%). CONCLUSION: Fungal pneumonia is a lethal complication in HC patients. Intensive care need is the most important predictive factor for mortality.","['Eren, Esma', 'Alp, Emine', 'Cevahir, Fatma', 'Tok, Tugba', 'Kilic, Aysegul Ulu', 'Kaynar, Leylagul', 'Yuksel, Recep Civan']","['Eren E', 'Alp E', 'Cevahir F', 'Tok T', 'Kilic AU', 'Kaynar L', 'Yuksel RC']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2712-9694', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0189-6008', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4834-5046', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9628-8197', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4454-374X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2035-9462', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4496-9473']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Infect Chemother,Infection & chemotherapy,101531537,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fungal pneumonia', 'Hematological cancer', 'Intensive care']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 05:26'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:26 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['52.530 [pii]', '10.3947/ic.2020.52.4.530 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Chemother. 2020 Dec;52(4):530-538. doi: 10.3947/ic.2020.52.4.530.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, Korean Society', 'for Antimicrobial Therapy, and The Korean Society for AIDS.']","['Kayseri City Hospital, Infectious Disease Clinic, Kayseri, Turkey. esmaereneryilmaz@gmail.com.', 'Ministry of Health, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Sakarya Applied Sciences, Akyazi Vocational School of Health Services, Medical Services and Techniques Department, Sakarya, Turkey.', 'Erciyes University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Erciyes University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Erciyes University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Kayseri City Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Kayseri, Turkey.']",,,['No conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7779983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the availability of molecular tools, low-resource settings struggle to diagnose the disease due to limited diagnostic capacity. The objective of this study was to detect common chromosomal aberrations in patients with ALL attending the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 19 blood samples from patients with ALL were screened for the presence of BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, and ETV6-RUNX1 fusion oncogenes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Blood counts and clinical characteristics of patients were also assessed. Results: The age of patients ranged from 1(1/2) to 72 years and comprised 57.9% of males and 42.1% of females. The majority of these patients were children (68%), and adults only comprised 32%. Only BCR-ABL and E2A-PBX1 oncogenes were detected in 3/19 of cases. The BCR-ABL gene was detected in a 4-year-old female child and a 15-year-old child. Both cases were associated with hepatomegaly and anemia coupled with low hemoglobin, white blood cell, and platelet counts. E2A-PBX1 was detected in a 12-year-old child with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, coupled with low hemoglobin, white blood cell, and platelet counts. All the three patients who harbored these fusion oncogenes died. Conclusion: This is the first study from Zambia to investigate the presence of fusion oncogenes in leukemia patients, which were found only among the older children population. Based on these findings, we recommend that molecular diagnosis be made a priority for the younger leukemia patient population at UTH.","['Okuku, Pauline', 'Kwenda, Geoffrey', 'Samutela, Mulemba', 'Nkhoma, Panji', 'Mantina, Hamakwa']","['Okuku P', 'Kwenda G', 'Samutela M', 'Nkhoma P', 'Mantina H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201007,India,Int J Appl Basic Med Res,International journal of applied & basic medical research,101579831,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Zambia', 'fusion oncogenes', 'reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 05:22'],"['2019/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:22 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/ijabmr.IJABMR_179_19 [doi]', 'IJABMR-10-234 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Appl Basic Med Res. 2020 Oct-Dec;10(4):234-239. doi: 10.4103/ijabmr.IJABMR_179_19.

Methods: Aged (18-month-old) Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes underwent sham surgery or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Animals received three doses of intravenous LIF (125 mug/kg) or PBS at 6, 24, and 48 h before euthanization at 72 h. Spleen weights were measured immediately following euthanization. Western blot was used to measure protein levels of CCL8, CD11b, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-12 p40, IL-3, and the LIF receptor (LIFR) in spleen tissue. ELISA was used to measure IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma in spleen tissue. A Griess Assay was used to indirectly quantify NO levels via measurement of nitrite. Levels of cellular markers and inflammatory mediators were normalized to the baseline (sham) group from each sex. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and followed by Fisher's LSD post hoc test. Results: Aged female rats showed a significantly lower spleen weight after MCAO, but showed a significant increase in spleen size after LIF treatment. This effect was observed in aged male rats, but not to as great of an extent. CD11b levels were significantly higher in the spleens of MCAO+PBS males compared to their female counterparts, but there was no significant difference in CD11b levels between MCAO+LIF males and females. LIF significantly increased CXCL9 after LIF treatment in aged male and female rats. LIFR and IL-3 were upregulated after LIF treatment in aged females. Splenic nitrate increased after MCAO but decreased after LIF treatment in aged females. Splenic nitrate levels did not increase after MCAO but did increase after LIF treatment in aged males. The following cytokines/chemokines were not altered by sex or treatment: TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-12 p40, CCL8, IFNgamma, and CXCL10. Conclusions: LIF treatment after permanent MCAO induces sex-dependent effects on the poststroke splenic response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines among aged rats.","['Davis, Stephanie M', 'Collier, Lisa A', 'Messmer, Sarah J', 'Pennypacker, Keith R']","['Davis SM', 'Collier LA', 'Messmer SJ', 'Pennypacker KR']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3895-8444', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4618-0903']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,IM,,,2020/12/31 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/12/30 05:21'],"['2020/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:21 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8880244 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2020 Dec 10;2020:8880244. doi: 10.1155/2020/8880244. eCollection 2020.,20210907,['Copyright (c) 2020 Stephanie M.

In leukemia and bladder cancer, the oncogenic activity of TRPV2 was linked to alteration of its expression profile. In multiple myeloma patients, TRPV2 overexpression correlated with bone tissue damage and poor prognosis. In prostate cancer, TRPV2 overexpression was associated with the castration-resistant phenotype and metastasis. Loss or inactivation of TRPV2 promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation and increased resistance to CD95-induced apoptotic cell death. TRPV2 overexpression was associated with high relapse-free survival in triple-negative breast cancer, whereas the opposite was found in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or gastric cancer. Another link was found between TRPV2 expression and either drug-induced cytotoxicity or stemness of liver cancer. Overall, these findings validate TRPV2 as a prime candidate for cancer biomarker and future therapeutic target.","['Siveen, Kodappully S', 'Nizamuddin, Parveen B', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Al-Thani, Mohamed', 'Frenneaux, Michael Paul', 'Janahi, Ibrahim A', 'Steinhoff, Martin', 'Azizi, Fouad']","['Siveen KS', 'Nizamuddin PB', 'Uddin S', 'Al-Thani M', 'Frenneaux MP', 'Janahi IA', 'Steinhoff M', 'Azizi F']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7793-2250'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201210,United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,IM,,,2020/12/31 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2020/12/30 05:21'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:21 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8892312 [doi]'],epublish,Dis Markers. 2020 Dec 10;2020:8892312. doi: 10.1155/2020/8892312. eCollection 2020.,20210913,['Copyright (c) 2020 Kodappully S.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of leukemia. miR-21 is highly expressed in multiple types of human cancer and displays oncogenic activities; however, the clinical significance of miR-21 in AML remains unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that miR-21 levels were high in patients with AML and in AML cell lines. Further experiments demonstrated that overexpression of miR-21 in Thp-1 human monocytes derived from acute mononuclear leukemia peripheral blood promoted cell proliferation, while downregulation of miR-21-5p, a mature sequence derived from the 5' end of the miR-21 stem-loop precursor (another mature sequence, miR-21-3p, is derived form 3' end of miR-21), inhibited cell proliferation. Specifically, it was observed that overexpression of miR-21 could promote the transition of Thp-1 cells into the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, as shown by flow cytometry. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-21-5p arrested cells in the S and G2/M phases. Finally, BCL11B was determined to be a functional target of miR-21-5p by luciferase assays. Our study revealed functional and mechanistic associations between miR-21 and BCL11B in Thp-1 cells, which could serve to guide clinical treatment of AML.","['Zhang, Liang', 'Yu, Li', 'Liu, Yiran', 'Wang, Shasha', 'Hou, Zhenfeng', 'Zhou, Jun']","['Zhang L', 'Yu L', 'Liu Y', 'Wang S', 'Hou Z', 'Zhou J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201215,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL11B', 'Thp-1 monocytes', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'miR-21-5p']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 05:21'],"['2019/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:21 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2020.12380 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12380 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2021 Feb;21(2):119. doi: 10.3892/ol.2020.12380.

It was demonstrated that bortezomib treatment induced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the viability of NB4 cells. Bortezomib treatment induced cell apoptosis in NB4 cells, as assessed by Annexin V/propidium iodide analysis, and the detection of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, Bax and Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, bortezomib treatment induced autophagy in NB4 cells, as indicated by autophagosome formation, p62 degradation, LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and formation of acidic autophagic vacuoles. Notably, autophagy induced by bortezomib was initiated prior to apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy by knocking down Beclin-1 expression increased bortezomib-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells.

In the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis pathway, the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine is catalyzed by cytosolic enzymes of the LPC acyltransferase (LPCAT) family. A number of studies have demonstrated that LPCAT1 overexpression is a frequent event in diverse human cancer types, and that it is associated with unfavorable pathological characteristics and patient survival. The aim of the present study was to explore the prognostic role of the expression of LPCAT family members in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using Cox regression analysis, only LPCAT1 expression was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker in AML. In a cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with AML and higher expression levels of LPCAT1 had shorter overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) times compared with those with lower expression levels of LPCAT1. This was further confirmed using an independent cohort from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Using a third cohort comprising patients with AML and healthy volunteers, it was confirmed that LPCAT1 expression was significantly increased in newly diagnosed AML cases compared with healthy controls. Moreover, higher expression of LPCAT1 was associated with French-American-British subtype-M4/M5 and nucleophosmin 1 mutations. Notably, patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following induction therapy exhibited significantly longer OS and LFS times compared with patients who only received chemotherapy after induction therapy in the higher LPCAT1 expression group, whereas no significant differences in OS and LFS times were observed between the HSCT and chemotherapy groups among total cases of AML in the lower LPCAT1 expression group. These results suggest that patients with AML who exhibit higher LPCAT1 expression levels may benefit from HSCT. Collectively, the findings of the present study indicate that LPCAT1 expression may serve as an independent prognostic biomarker that can guide the choice between HSCT and chemotherapy in patients with AML.","['Wang, Ke', 'Wu, Zhidan', 'Si, Yuan', 'Tang, Wendong', 'Xu, Xin', 'Cheng, Yan', 'Lin, Jiang']","['Wang K', 'Wu Z', 'Si Y', 'Tang W', 'Xu X', 'Cheng Y', 'Lin J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,['NOTNLM'],"['LPCAT1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarker', 'expression', 'prognosis']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 05:21'],"['2020/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:21 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2020.12366 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12366 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2021 Feb;21(2):105. doi: 10.3892/ol.2020.12366.

Disease recurrence driven by leukaemia stem cells (LSCs), a sub-population of leukaemia cells presenting self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential, is a major problem in the treatment of AML. Although a hypoxic microenvironment is considered to promote AML malignant behaviours and is considered a potential therapeutic target, the effect of hypoxic stimulation of LSCs is still largely unknown. Therefore, the present study analysed the effects of hypoxia on the malignant behaviours of LSCs. Hypoxia exposure upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, which upregulated the transcription of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1). Hypoxia exposure also activated the PI3K/Akt pathway and promoted the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in LSCs via hypoxia-mediated activation of HIF-1alpha. BMI-1 served an important role in the hypoxia-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the promotion of EMT. Hypoxia exposure promoted chemoresistance against cytarabine arabinoside by inducing HIF-1alpha, thus activating the transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha. Knockdown of BMI-1 disrupted hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in LSCs, indicating that HIF-1alpha-induced BMI-1 has a role in hypoxia-promoted malignant behaviours. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that induced BMI-1 inhibits the self-renewal capacity in LSCs under hypoxic conditions. The present study provides in vitro evidence demonstrating that hypoxia exposure regulates LSCs by activating HIF-1alpha/BMI-1 signalling, in turn modulating PI3K/Akt signalling and EMT. These results highlight potentially novel therapeutic targets of LSCs to improve the treatment of AML.","['Jiang, Mingyan', 'He, Guoqian', 'Li, Jianhua', 'Li, Jinrong', 'Guo, Xia', 'Gao, Ju']","['Jiang M', 'He G', 'Li J', 'Li J', 'Guo X', 'Gao J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201208,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell-specific Moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1', 'epithelial mesenchymal transition', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha', 'leukaemia stem cells']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 05:21'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:21 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2020.12359 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12359 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2021 Feb;21(2):98. doi: 10.3892/ol.2020.12359.

Despite the presence of potential confounders, we hypothesise the potential role of imatinib as a chemopreventive agent in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.","['Tobon, Angelica', 'Olivas, Pol', 'Ocana, Teresa', 'Pellise, Maria', 'Balaguer, Francesc']","['Tobon A', 'Olivas P', 'Ocana T', 'Pellise M', 'Balaguer F']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3341-9962'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,BMJ Open Gastroenterol,BMJ open gastroenterology,101660690,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer prevention', '*chemoprevention', '*colorectal cancer', '*familial adenomatous polyposis']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/12/30 05:17'],"['2020/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 05:17 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjgast-2020-000555 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjgast-2020-000555 [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ Open Gastroenterol. 2020 Dec;7(1). pii: bmjgast-2020-000555. doi: 10.1136/bmjgast-2020-000555.,20211124,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The purpose of this study is to explore ILCregs and its associated miRNAs in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) by evaluating ILCregs frequency, associated miRNA quantification, and their significance. METHODS: Using 4 color combinations of surface and intracellular antibody staining, the CD45+Lin-CD127+IL-10+ ILCregs from 30 healthy donors and 30 patients newly diagnosed with AA were measured by fl ow cytometry. Bone marrow cells were studied by next-generation sequence miRNAs quanti fi cation. RESULTS: Our results showed that the frequency of ILCregs in bone marrow cells from healthy donors (HD) and AA patients were 0.703 +/- 0.941 and 0.171 +/- 0.233%, respectively. The frequencies of ILCregs in AA patients were significantly lower than that in HD (p <0.05). miRNA detection results showed different expression patterns in the AA patient group comparing with HD. Comparing with HD, there were 52 miRNAs up-regulated and 130 miRNAs down-regulated from AA patients. Analysis of miRNAs from ILCregs associated genes demonstrated different miRNAs expression patterns between HD and AA patient. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated the deficiency of ILCregs and differential expression pattern of ILCregs gene-related miRNA in patients with AA. Further studies need to be done to explore the clinical significance of ILCregs and related miRNAs in patients with AA with large samples size and clinical follow-up.","['Li, Yingmei', 'Wan, Dingming', 'Guo, Rong', 'Wang, Fang', 'Han, Lijie', 'Zhang, Danfeng', 'Xing, Haizhou', 'Cao, Weijie', 'Liu, Yu', 'Xie, Xinsheng', 'Yu, Jifeng', 'Jiang, Zhongxing']","['Li Y', 'Wan D', 'Guo R', 'Wang F', 'Han L', 'Zhang D', 'Xing H', 'Cao W', 'Liu Y', 'Xie X', 'Yu J', 'Jiang Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1217-4385'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'HD', 'ILC', 'ILCregs', 'NGS', 'Regulatory innate lymphoid cells', 'Treg', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'aplastic anemia', 'bone marrow', 'flow cytometry', 'healthy donors', 'innate lymphoid cells', 'miRNA', 'next generation sequencing', 'next-generation sequencing', 'profiling', 'quantification', 'regulatory T cells', 'regulatory innate lymphoid cells']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/12/30 05:15'],"['2020/12/30 05:15 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1866304 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):37-42. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1866304.,20210510,,"[""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['0 (MicroRNAs)'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) were also noted to harbor mutations in CBL, but were found to have generally less aggressive disease courses compared to other forms of Ras pathway-mutant JMML. Importantly, and in contrast to most reports in adults, the majority of CBL mutations in JMML patients are germline with acquired uniparental disomy occurring in affected marrow cells. Here, we systematically studied a large cohort of 33 JMML patients with CBL mutations and found this disease to be highly diverse in presentation and overall outcome. Moreover, we discovered somatically-acquired CBL mutations in 15% of pediatric patients who presented with more aggressive disease. Neither clinical features nor methylation profiling were able to distinguish somatic CBL patients from germline CBL patients, highlighting the need for germline testing. Overall, we demonstrate that disease courses are quite heterogeneous even among germline CBL patients.

CD38 is an established immunotherapeutic target in multiple myeloma and under investigation as a target antigen in AML. CD38 expression on NK cells and its further induction during ex vivo NK cell expansion represents a barrier to the development of a CD38 CAR-NK cell therapy. We set out to develop a CD38 CAR-NK cell therapy for AML, first by using an NK cell line which has low baseline CD38 expression and subsequently healthy donor expanded NK cells. To overcome anticipated fratricide due to NK cell CD38 expression when using primary expanded NK cells, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to disrupt the CD38 gene during expansion achieving a mean knockdown efficiency of 84%. The resulting CD38 KD expanded NK cells, after expression of an affinity optimized CD38 CAR, showed reduced NK cell fratricide and an enhanced ability to target primary AML blasts. Furthermore, the cytotoxic potential of CD38 CAR-NK cells was augmented by pre-treatment of the AML cells with all-trans retinoic acid which drove enhanced CD38 expression offering a rational combination therapy. These findings support the further investigation of CD38 KD - CD38 CAR-NK cells as a viable immunotherapeutic approach to the treatment of AML.","['Gurney, Mark', 'Stikvoort, Arwen', 'Nolan, Emma', 'Kirkham-McCarthy, Lucy', 'Khoruzhenko, Stanislav', 'Shivakumar, Rama', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Van de Donk, Niels W C J', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'Szegezdi, Eva', 'Sarkar, Subhashis', ""O'Dwyer, Michael""]","['Gurney M', 'Stikvoort A', 'Nolan E', 'Kirkham-McCarthy L', 'Khoruzhenko S', 'Shivakumar R', 'Zweegman S', 'Van de Donk NWCJ', 'Mutis T', 'Szegezdi E', 'Sarkar S', ""O'Dwyer M""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201230,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2020/12/31 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/12/30 04:51'],"['2020/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/30 04:51 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.271908 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2020 Dec 30;Online ahead of print. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.271908.,20210527,,"['National University of Ireland Galway, Galway.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam.', 'National University of Ireland Galway, Galway.', 'National University of Ireland Galway, Galway.', 'MaxCyte, Inc., Maryland.', 'MaxCyte, Inc., Maryland.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam.', 'National University of Ireland Galway, Galway.', 'National University of Ireland Galway, Galway.', 'National University of Ireland Galway, Galway. michael.odwyer@nuigalway.ie.']","['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']","['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Killer Cells, Natural', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate these initiating events we have used a human model system of AML driven by the KMT2A-MLLT3 (KM3) fusion. More specifically, we investigated changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility at each stage of our model system and correlated these with expression changes. We observe the development of a profound hypomethylation phenotype in the early stages of leukemic transformation after KM3 addition along with loss of expression of stem cell associated genes along with skewed expression in other genes such as S100A8/9 implicated in leukemogenesis. In addition, early increases in the expression of the lysine demethylase KDM4B was functionally linked to these expression changes as well as other key transcription factors. Remarkably, our ATAC-seq data showed that there were relatively few leukemiaspecific changes and the vast majority corresponded to open chromatin regions and transcription factor clusters previously observed in other cell types. Integration of the gene expression and epigenetic changes revealed the adenylate cyclase gene ADCY9 as an essential gene in KM3-AML, and suggest the potential for autocrine signalling through the chemokine receptor CCR1 and CCL23 ligand. Together, our results suggest that KM3 induces subtle changes in the epigenome while co-opting the normal transcriptional machinery to drive leukemogenesis.","['Milan, Thomas', 'Celton, Magalie', 'Lagace, Karine', 'Roques, Elodie', 'Safa-Tahar-Henni, Safia', 'Bresson, Eva', 'Bergeron, Anne', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Cellot, Sonia', 'Barabe, Frederic', 'Wilhelm, Brian T']","['Milan T', 'Celton M', 'Lagace K', 'Roques E', 'Safa-Tahar-Henni S', 'Bresson E', 'Bergeron A', 'Hebert J', 'Meshinchi S', 'Cellot S', 'Barabe F', 'Wilhelm BT']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220101,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2020/12/31 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/12/30 04:51'],"['2020/12/30 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/30 04:51 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.271619 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2022 Jan 1;107(1):86-99. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.271619.,20210527,,"['Laboratory for High Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC.', 'Laboratory for High Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC.', 'Laboratory for High Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC.', 'Laboratory for High Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC.', 'Laboratory for High Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC.', 'Centre de recherche en infectiologie du CHUL, Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec - Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; CHU de Quebec - Universite Laval - Hopital Enfant-Jesus; Quebec City, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC.', 'Centre de recherche en infectiologie du CHUL, Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec - Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; CHU de Quebec - Universite Laval - Hopital Enfant-Jesus; Quebec City, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Leukemia Cell Bank of Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of pediatrics, division of Hematology, Ste-Justine Hospital, Montreal, QC.', 'Centre de recherche en infectiologie du CHUL, Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec - Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; CHU de Quebec - Universite Laval - Hopital Enfant-Jesus; Quebec City, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC.', 'Laboratory for High Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC. brian.wilhelm@umontreal.ca.']","['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM4B protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (adenylate cyclase 9)']","['Adenylyl Cyclases', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,PMC8719083,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 25% of AML patients carry FLT3 mutations and develop post-treatment insensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors, including sorafenib. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified LZTR1, NF1, TSC1 or TSC2, negative regulators of the MAPK and MTOR pathways, as mediators of sorafenib resistance. Analyses of ex vivo drug sensitivity assays in FLT3-ITD AML patient samples revealed lower expression of LZTR1, NF1, and TSC2 correlated with sorafenib sensitivity. Importantly, MAPK and/or MTOR complex1 (MTORC1) activity were upregulated in AML cells made resistant to several FLT3 inhibitors, including crenolanib, quizartinib, or sorafenib. These cells were sensitive to MEK inhibitors, and the combination of FLT3 and MEK inhibitors showed enhanced efficacy, suggesting its effectiveness in AML patients with FLT3 mutations and those with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.","['Damnernsawad, Alisa', 'Bottomly, Daniel', 'Kurtz, Stephen E', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Nechiporuk, Tamilla']","['Damnernsawad A', 'Bottomly D', 'Kurtz SE', 'Eide CA', 'McWeeney SK', 'Tyner JW', 'Nechiporuk T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20220101,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2020/12/31 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/12/30 04:51'],"['2020/12/30 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2020/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/30 04:51 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.257964 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2022 Jan 1;107(1):77-85. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.257964.,20210527,,"['Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA; Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR. tynerj@ohsu.edu.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR. nechipot@ohsu.edu.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (LZTR1 protein, human)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']","['*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Sorafenib/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,"['P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA251708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA217862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8719098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypericum also displays an ample variety of other biological actions, such as hypotensive, analgesic, anti-infective, anti-oxidant, and spasmolytic abilities. However, recent investigations highlighted that this species could be advantageous for the cure of other pathological situations, such as trigeminal neuralgia, as well as in the treatment of cancer. This review focuses on the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), its derivatives, and other Hypericum species in hematologic malignancies. Hypericum induces apoptosis in both myeloid and lymphoid cells. Other Hypericum targets include matrix metalloproteinase-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which are mediators of cell migration and angiogenesis. Hypericum also downregulates the expression of proteins that are involved in the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, Hypericum and its derivatives appear to have photodynamic effects and are candidates for applications in tumor photodynamic therapy. Although the in vitro studies appear promising, controlled in vivo studies are necessary before we can hypothesize the introduction of Hypericum and its derivatives into clinical practice for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Allegra, Alessandro', 'Tonacci, Alessandro', 'Spagnolo, Elvira Ventura', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Gangemi, Sebastiano']","['Allegra A', 'Tonacci A', 'Spagnolo EV', 'Musolino C', 'Gangemi S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6156-8239', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8335-5541']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201225,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Hypericum', ""St. John's wort"", 'apoptosis', 'hyperforin', 'hypericin', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'multidrug resistance', 'photodynamic therapy']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/12/30 01:05'],"['2020/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:05 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010146 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010146 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 25;22(1). pii: ijms22010146. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010146.,20210401,,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy.', 'Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), 56124 Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Legal Medicine, Department of Health Promotion Sciences, Maternal and Infant Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties (PROMISE), University of Palermo, Via del Vespro, 129, 90127 Palermo, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy.', 'School and Operative Unit of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, 98125 Messina, Italy.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypericum/*chemistry', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,,PMC7795730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce a potent antileukemic response mostly based on the inhibition of BCR-ABL, but they also increase the activity of Natural Killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. After several years, patients may interrupt treatment due to sustained, deep molecular response. By unknown reasons, half of the patients relapse during treatment interruption, whereas others maintain a potent control of the residual leukemic cells for several years. In this study, several immunological parameters related to sustained antileukemic control were analyzed. According to our results, the features more related to poor antileukemic control were as follows: low levels of cytotoxic cells such as NK, (Natural Killer T) NKT and CD8+/-TCRgammabeta+ T cells; low expression of activating receptors on the surface of NK and NKT cells; impaired synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines or proteases from NK cells; and HLA-E*0103 homozygosis and KIR haplotype BX. A Random Forest algorithm predicted 90% of the accuracy for the classification of CML patients in groups of relapse or non-relapse according to these parameters. Consequently, these features may be useful as biomarkers predictive of CML relapse in patients that are candidates to initiate treatment discontinuation.","['Vigon, Lorena', 'Luna, Alejandro', 'Galan, Miguel', 'Rodriguez-Mora, Sara', 'Fuertes, Daniel', 'Mateos, Elena', 'Piris-Villaespesa, Miguel', 'Bautista, Guiomar', 'San Jose, Esther', 'Rivera-Torres, Jose', 'Steegmann, Juan Luis', 'de Ory, Fernando', 'Perez-Olmeda, Mayte', 'Alcami, Jose', 'Planelles, Vicente', 'Lopez-Huertas, Maria Rosa', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Coiras, Mayte']","['Vigon L', 'Luna A', 'Galan M', 'Rodriguez-Mora S', 'Fuertes D', 'Mateos E', 'Piris-Villaespesa M', 'Bautista G', 'San Jose E', 'Rivera-Torres J', 'Steegmann JL', 'de Ory F', 'Perez-Olmeda M', 'Alcami J', 'Planelles V', 'Lopez-Huertas MR', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Coiras M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6695-1509', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5746-2199', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5707-628X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0365-9604', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4553-5423', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0023-7377', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6464-5770']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201225,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'immunological response', 'treatment-free remission']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 01:04'],"['2020/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10010042 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10010042 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Dec 25;10(1). pii: jcm10010042. doi: 10.3390/jcm10010042.,,,"['Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Instituto Ramon y Cajal de Investigacion Sanitaria (IRYCIS), Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, 28034 Madrid, Spain.', 'Pharmacy and Biotechnology Department, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Europea de Madrid, 28670 Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.', 'School of Telecommunications Engineering, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Instituto Ramon y Cajal de Investigacion Sanitaria (IRYCIS), Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, 28034 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, 28222 Madrid, Spain.', 'Pharmacy and Biotechnology Department, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Europea de Madrid, 28670 Madrid, Spain.', 'Pharmacy and Biotechnology Department, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Europea de Madrid, 28670 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'Serology Service, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.', 'Serology Service, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.', 'Division of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.', 'Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Instituto Ramon y Cajal de Investigacion Sanitaria (IRYCIS), Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, 28034 Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunopathology Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 28220 Madrid, Spain.']",,,,,"['IMP19_18/Instituto Ramon y Cajal de Investigacion Sanitaria', 'R01AI143567/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'SAF2016-78480-R, PID2019-110275RB-I00/Spanish Ministry of Economy and', 'Competitiveness', 'RD16CIII/0002/0001/Spanish AIDS Research Network', 'FIS PI16CIII/00034-ISCIII-FEDER/Instituto de Salud Carlos III']",PMC7795332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personalized low dose rIL-2 in combination with either lenalidomide or venetoclax mediates natural killer stimulation and is an effective non-toxic immunotherapy administered in the outpatient setting for poor prognosis CLL.","['Maharaj, Dipnarine', 'Srinivasan, Gayathri', 'Abreu, Maria M', 'Ko, Meng-Wei', 'Jewett, Anahid', 'Gouvea, Jacqueline']","['Maharaj D', 'Srinivasan G', 'Abreu MM', 'Ko MW', 'Jewett A', 'Gouvea J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9825-1905'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20201222,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer treatment', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*immunotherapy', '*interleukin-2', '*natural killer cells']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2020/12/30 01:03'],"['2020/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10010010 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10010010 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Dec 22;10(1). pii: cells10010010. doi: 10.3390/cells10010010.,20210721,,"['The Maharaj Institute of Immune Regenerative Medicine, Boynton Beach, FL 33437, USA.', 'The Maharaj Institute of Immune Regenerative Medicine, Boynton Beach, FL 33437, USA.', 'Institute for NeuroImmune Medicine, Nova Southeastern University, Ft.

Recently, we have discovered that TRPA1 is also expressed in human osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes and downregulated by the anti-inflammatory drugs aurothiomalate and dexamethasone. We have also shown TRPA1 to mediate inflammation, pain, and cartilage degeneration in experimental osteoarthritis. In this study, we investigated the role of TRPA1 in joint inflammation, focusing on the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). We utilized cartilage/chondrocytes from wild-type (WT) and TRPA1 knockout (KO) mice, along with primary chondrocytes from OA patients. The results show that TRPA1 regulates the synthesis of the OA-driving inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in chondrocytes. IL-6 was highly expressed in WT chondrocytes, and its expression, along with the expression of IL-6 family cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and IL-11, were significantly downregulated by TRPA1 deficiency. Furthermore, treatment with the TRPA1 antagonist significantly downregulated the expression of IL-6 in chondrocytes from WT mice and OA patients. The results suggest that TRPA1 is involved in the upregulation of IL-6 production in chondrocytes. These findings together with previous results on the expression and functions of TRPA1 in cellular and animal models point to the role of TRPA1 as a potential mediator and novel drug target in osteoarthritis.","['Nummenmaa, Elina', 'Hamalainen, Mari', 'Pemmari, Antti', 'Moilanen, Lauri J', 'Tuure, Lauri', 'Nieminen, Riina M', 'Moilanen, Teemu', 'Vuolteenaho, Katriina', 'Moilanen, Eeva']","['Nummenmaa E', 'Hamalainen M', 'Pemmari A', 'Moilanen LJ', 'Tuure L', 'Nieminen RM', 'Moilanen T', 'Vuolteenaho K', 'Moilanen E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8187-1216'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-6', 'TRPA1', 'chondrocyte', 'inflammation', 'osteoarthritis']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/12/30 01:02'],"['2020/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010087 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010087 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 23;22(1). pii: ijms22010087. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010087.,20210309,,"['The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, FI-33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.']","['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (TRPA1 Cation Channel)', '0 (Trpa1 protein, mouse)', '0 (interleukin-6, mouse)']","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoarthritis/*metabolism', 'TRPA1 Cation Channel/genetics/*metabolism']",,,"['na/Academy of Finland', 'na/Competitive Research Funding of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Finland', 'na/Tampere Tuberculosis Foundation, Finland', 'na/Finnish Cultural Foundation, Finland', 'na/Research Foundation of Rheumatic Diseases, Finland', 'na/Patient Organization for Rheumatoid Arthritis (Tampereen Reumayhdistys),', 'Finland', 'na/Maire Lisko Foundation, Finland', 'na/The Paulo Foundation, Finland']",PMC7794684,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A.S. extract induced ROS generation through the activation of MAPK p38 phosphorylation. It also inhibited IL-2 mRNA expression and NF-kappaB signaling mediated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and phytohemagglutinin. Combined treatment with A.S. extract and axitinib/dovitinib exerted enhanced inhibitory effects on T-ALL cell growth and IL-2 production.

PRCs play a pivotal role in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells through repression of target genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Next-generation sequencing technologies have revealed that various hematologic malignancies harbor mutations in PRC2 genes, such as EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, and PRC1.1 genes, such as BCOR and BCORL1. Except for the activating EZH2 mutations detected in lymphoma, most of these mutations compromise PRC function and are frequently associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown that mutations in PRC genes are druggable targets. Several PRC2 inhibitors, including EZH2-specific inhibitors and EZH1 and EZH2 dual inhibitors have shown therapeutic efficacy for tumors with and without activating EZH2 mutations. Moreover, EZH2 loss-of-function mutations appear to be attractive therapeutic targets for implementing the concept of synthetic lethality. Further understanding of the epigenetic dysregulation associated with PRCs in hematological malignancies should improve treatment outcomes.","['Kaito, Satoshi', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Kaito S', 'Iwama A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7966-291X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9410-8992']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201223,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'hematologic malignancies', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'myeloproliferative disease', 'polycomb repressive complexes', 'synthetic lethality']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/12/30 01:02'],"['2020/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010074 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010074 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 23;22(1). pii: ijms22010074. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010074.,20210309,,"['Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,"['#19H05653, #19H05746/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and', 'Technology']",PMC7793497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, through cytogenetic testing, a special case of concordant ALL in monozygotic twins was presented with different outcomes. In spite of an acceptable initial consequence to medical treatment in twins, in another brother (Twin B), early relapse was observed. In the cytogenetic study, both twins expressed t (4; 11) (q21; q23) while twin A expressed t (2; 7) (p10; q10). No cases have previously reported this mutation.

Nevertheless, a broad range of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light into the identification of several genetic variants presumptively associated with B-cell NHL etiologies, survival or shared genetic risk with other diseases. The present review aims to overview HLA structure and diversity and summarize the evidence of genetic variations, by GWAS, on five NHL subtypes (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL, follicular lymphoma FL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL, marginal zone lymphoma MZL, and primary central nervous system lymphoma PCNSL). Evidence indicates that the HLA zygosity status in B-cell NHL might promote immune escape and that genome-wide significance variants can give biological insight but also potential therapeutic markers such as WEE1 in DLBCL. However, additional studies are needed, especially for non-DLBCL, to replicate the associations found to date.","['Hernandez-Verdin, Isaias', 'Labreche, Karim', 'Benazra, Marion', 'Mokhtari, Karima', 'Hoang-Xuan, Khe', 'Alentorn, Agusti']","['Hernandez-Verdin I', 'Labreche K', 'Benazra M', 'Mokhtari K', 'Hoang-Xuan K', 'Alentorn A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201224,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"[""B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'GWAS', 'HLA', 'cancer risk']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2020/12/30 01:01'],"['2020/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22010122 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22010122 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 24;22(1). pii: ijms22010122. doi: 10.3390/ijms22010122.,20210913,,"['Faculte de Medecine, Sorbonne Universite, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), 75013 Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Sorbonne Universite, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), 75013 Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Sorbonne Universite, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), 75013 Paris, France.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) U 1127, 75013 Paris, France.', 'National Center for Scientific Research, Joint Research Unit 7225, 75013 Paris, France.', 'ICM, iGenSeq Platform, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Raymond Escourolle Department of Neuropathology, Public Assistance-Hospitals of Paris, Hospital Group of Pitie-Salpetriere, 75013 Paris, France.', 'APHP, Department of Neurology-2, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie Salpetriere, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Sorbonne Universite, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), 75013 Paris, France.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) U 1127, 75013 Paris, France.', 'National Center for Scientific Research, Joint Research Unit 7225, 75013 Paris, France.', 'APHP, Department of Neurology-2, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie Salpetriere, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Reseau Expert National LOC (Lymphomes Oculo-Cerebraux), Groupe Hospitalier Pitie Salpetriere, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Sorbonne Universite, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), 75013 Paris, France.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) U 1127, 75013 Paris, France.', 'National Center for Scientific Research, Joint Research Unit 7225, 75013 Paris, France.', 'APHP, Department of Neurology-2, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie Salpetriere, 75013 Paris, France.']","['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Lipids)']","['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Genetic Background', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors']",,,"['PRT-K grant 2017-1-RT-04/DGOS / INCa', 'ANR-18-RHUS-0012/Agence Nationale de la Recherche']",PMC7795678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, the presence of an NPM1 mutation reduces the negative prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD in patients treated with conventional ""3+7"" induction. However, little information is available on their prognostic role with intensified regimens. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin induction (FLAI) in 149 consecutive fit AML patients (median age 52) carrying the NPM1 and/or FLT3-ITD mutation, treated from 2008 to 2018. One-hundred-and-twenty-nine patients achieved CR (86.6%). After a median follow up of 68 months, 3-year overall survival was 58.6%. Multivariate analysis disclosed that both NPM1mut (p < 0.05) and ELN 2017 risk score (p < 0.05) were significant predictors of survival. NPM1-mutated patients had a favorable outcome, with no significant differences between patients with or without concomitant FLT3-ITD (p = 0.372), irrespective of FLT3-ITD allelic burden. Moreover, in landmark analysis, performing allogeneic transplantation (HSCT) in first CR proved to be beneficial only in ELN 2017 high-risk patients. Our data indicate that FLAI exerts a strong anti-leukemic effect in younger AML patients with NPM1mut and question the role of HSCT in 1st CR in NPM1mut patients with concomitant FLT3-ITD.","['Minetto, Paola', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Guolo, Fabio', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Zannier, Maria Elena', 'Miglino, Maurizio', 'Dubbini, Maria Vittoria', 'Carminati, Enrico', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Ciofini, Sara', 'Colombo, Nicoletta', 'Pugliese, Girolamo', 'Marcolin, Riccardo', 'Santoni, Adele', 'Ballerini, Filippo', 'Lanino, Luca', 'Cea, Michele', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Lemoli, Roberto Massimo']","['Minetto P', 'Candoni A', 'Guolo F', 'Clavio M', 'Zannier ME', 'Miglino M', 'Dubbini MV', 'Carminati E', 'Sicuranza A', 'Ciofini S', 'Colombo N', 'Pugliese G', 'Marcolin R', 'Santoni A', 'Ballerini F', 'Lanino L', 'Cea M', 'Gobbi M', 'Bocchia M', 'Fanin R', 'Lemoli RM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6094-4351', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4436-1310', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3166-6078', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2404-8829', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1530-6729', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0756-109X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3538-3913']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201224,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'NPM1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'intensified induction', 'minimal residual disease assessment']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 01:00'],"['2020/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:00 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13010034 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13010034 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 24;13(1). pii: cancers13010034. doi: 10.3390/cancers13010034.,,,"['Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata di Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata di Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata di Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University of Siena, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University of Siena, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University of Siena, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University of Siena, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata di Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS-Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.']",,,,,,PMC7796342,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human Notch family comprises of four receptors (Notch 1 to 4) and five ligands. Their signaling can regulate extremely basic cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation and death. Notch is also involved in hematopoiesis and angiogenesis, and increasing evidence suggests that these genes are involved and frequently deregulated in several human malignancies, contributing to cell autonomous activities that may be either oncogenic or tumor suppressive. It was recently proposed that Notch signaling could play an active role in promoting and sustaining a broad spectrum of lymphoid malignancies as well as mutations in Notch family members that are present in several disorders of T- and B-cells, which could be responsible for altering the related signaling. Therefore, different Notch pathway molecules could be considered as potential therapeutic targets for hematological cancers. In this review, we will summarize and discuss compelling evidence pointing to Notch receptors as pleiotropic regulators of hematologic malignancies biology, first describing the physiological role of their signaling in T- and B-cell development and homeostasis, in order to fully understand the pathological alterations reported.","['Gragnani, Laura', 'Lorini, Serena', 'Marri, Silvia', 'Zignego, Anna Linda']","['Gragnani L', 'Lorini S', 'Marri S', 'Zignego AL']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6800-9149', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3547-5092']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201224,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cells', '*Notch', '*Notch receptor', '*Notch signaling', '*T-cells', '*hematological malignancies', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma']",2020/12/31 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/12/30 01:00'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:00 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10010016 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10010016 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Dec 24;10(1). pii: cells10010016. doi: 10.3390/cells10010016.,20210712,,"['MASVE Interdepartmental Hepatology Center, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine,University of Florence, Center for Research and Innovation CRIA-MASVE, 50134 Firenze, Italy.', 'MASVE Interdepartmental Hepatology Center, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine,University of Florence, Center for Research and Innovation CRIA-MASVE, 50134 Firenze, Italy.', 'MASVE Interdepartmental Hepatology Center, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine,University of Florence, Center for Research and Innovation CRIA-MASVE, 50134 Firenze, Italy.', 'MASVE Interdepartmental Hepatology Center, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine,University of Florence, Center for Research and Innovation CRIA-MASVE, 50134 Firenze, Italy.']","['0 (Receptors, Notch)']","['Animals', '*B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', '*T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/pathology']",,,,PMC7823720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It rapidly depletes the plasma asparagine and deprives the blood cells of this circulating amino acid, essential for the metabolic cycles of cells. In the search for viable alternatives to produce L-asparaginase, this work aimed to produce this enzyme from Escherichia coli in a shaker and in a 3 L bioreactor. Three culture media were tested: defined, semi-defined and complex medium. L-asparaginase activity was quantified using the beta-hydroxamate aspartic acid method. The defined medium provided the highest L-asparaginase activity. In induction studies, two inducers, lactose and its analog IPTG, were compared. Lactose was chosen as an inducer for the experiments conducted in the bioreactor due to its natural source, lower cost and lower toxicity. Batch and fed-batch cultures were carried out to reach high cell density and then start the induction. Batch cultivation provided a final cell concentration of 11 g L(-1) and fed-batch cultivation produced 69.90 g L(-1) of cells, which produced a volumetric activity of 43,954.79 U L(-1) after lactose induction. L-asparaginase was produced in a shaker and scaled up to a bioreactor, increasing 23-fold the cell concentration and thus, the enzyme productivity.","['Barros, Thais', 'Brumano, Larissa', 'Freitas, Marcela', 'Pessoa, Adalberto Junior', 'Parachin, Nadia', 'Magalhaes, Perola O']","['Barros T', 'Brumano L', 'Freitas M', 'Pessoa A Junior', 'Parachin N', 'Magalhaes PO']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7847-4853', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1135-4827', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5268-8690', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8011-6940']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201224,Switzerland,Pharmaceutics,Pharmaceutics,101534003,,['NOTNLM'],"['Escherichia coli', 'IPTG', 'L-asparaginase', 'bioreactor', 'lactose', 'shaker']",2020/12/31 06:00,2020/12/31 06:01,['2020/12/30 01:00'],"['2020/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 01:00 [entrez]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['pharmaceutics13010014 [pii]', '10.3390/pharmaceutics13010014 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceutics. 2020 Dec 24;13(1). pii: pharmaceutics13010014. doi: 10.3390/pharmaceutics13010014.,,,"['Department of Pharmacy, Health Sciences School, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Health Sciences School, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Biology, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Health Sciences School, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil.']",,,,,"['AwardNumber 2017/21819-9/Sao Paulo Research Foundation', 'FinanceCode 001/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -', 'Brasil (CAPES)']",PMC7823503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rho kinases (ROCK) are constitutively activated by FLT3-ITD+ in AML via PI3 kinase and Rho GTPase. Upon activation by ROCK, LIM kinases (LIMK) inactivate cofilin by phosphorylation which affects cytoskeleton dynamics, cell growth and apoptosis. LIMK inhibition leads to cofilin activation via dephosphorylation and activated cofilin localizes to mitochondria inducing apoptosis. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the LIMK1/2 inhibitor CEL_Amide (LIMKi) in FLT3-ITD+ AML. Expression of LIMK1/2 in FLT3-ITD+ cell lines MOLM-13 and MV-4-11 cells could be detected by RT-qPCR and at the protein level. IC50 after LIMKi monotherapy was 440 nM in MOLM-13 cells and 420 nM in MV4-11 cells. Treatment with LIMKi decreased LIMK1 protein levels and repression of inactivating phosphorylation of cofilin in FLT3-ITD+ cells. Combination experiments with LIMKi and FLT3 inhibitors including midostaurin, crenolanib and gilteritinib were synergistic for treatment of MOLM-13 cells while combinations with quizartinib were additive. Combinations of LIMKi and the hypomethylating agent azacitidine or the ROCK inhibitor fasudil were additive. In NOD-SCID mice engrafted with MOLM13-LUC cells, the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin and LIMKi delayed MOLM13-LUC engraftment as detected by in vivo bioluminescence imaging and the LIMKi and midostaurin combination prolonged significantly survival of leukemic mice.

The SUV family of H3K9 methyltransferases, which include G9a, GLP, SETDB1, SETDB2, SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 deposit H3K9me1/2/3 marks at euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, catalyzed by their conserved SET domain. In cancer, this family of enzymes can be deregulated by genomic alterations and transcriptional mis-expression leading to alteration of transcriptional programs. In solid and hematological malignancies, studies have uncovered pro-oncogenic roles for several H3K9 methyltransferases and accordingly, small molecule inhibitors are being tested as potential therapies. However, emerging evidence demonstrate onco-suppressive roles for these enzymes in cancer development as well. Here, we review the role H3K9 methyltransferases play in tumorigenesis focusing on gene targets and biological pathways affected due to misregulation of these enzymes. We also discuss molecular mechanisms regulating H3K9 methyltransferases and their influence on cancer. Finally, we describe the impact of H3K9 methylation on therapy induced resistance in carcinoma. Converging evidence point to multi-faceted roles for H3K9 methyltransferases in development and cancer that encourages a deeper understanding of these enzymes to inform novel therapy.","['Saha, Nirmalya', 'Muntean, Andrew G']","['Saha N', 'Muntean AG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20201226,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Samd9/9L genes are located in tandem on chromosome 7 and have been known to be the genes responsible for myeloid malignancies associated with monosomy 7. Additionally, as IFN-inducible genes, Samd9/9L are crucial for protection against viruses. Samd9/9L syndromes are caused by gain-of-function mutations and develop into infantile myelodysplastic syndromes associated with monosomy 7 (MDS/-7) at extraordinarily high frequencies. We generated mice expressing Samd9LD764N, which mimic MIRAGE syndrome, presenting with growth retardation, a short life, bone marrow failure, and multiorgan degeneration. In hematopoietic cells, Samd9LD764N downregulates the endocytosis of transferrin and c-Kit, resulting in a rare cause of anemia and a low bone marrow reconstitutive potential that ultimately causes MDS/-7. In contrast, in nonhematopoietic cells we tested, Samd9LD764N upregulated the endocytosis of EGFR by Ship2 phosphatase translocation to the cytomembrane and activated lysosomes, resulting in the reduced expression of surface receptors and signaling. Thus, Samd9/9L is a downstream regulator of IFN that controls receptor metabolism, with constitutive activation leading to multiorgan dysfunction.","['Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Nakamura, Megumi', 'Okuda, Hiroshi', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko', 'Shinriki, Satoru', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Inaba, Toshiya']","['Nagamachi A', 'Kanai A', 'Nakamura M', 'Okuda H', 'Yokoyama A', 'Shinriki S', 'Matsui H', 'Inaba T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow', '*Cell Biology', '*Cytokines', '*Hematology', '*Mouse models']",2020/12/30 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/12/29 17:08'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/29 17:08 [entrez]']","['140147 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI140147 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Feb 15;131(4). pii: 140147. doi: 10.1172/JCI140147.,20210920,,"['Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']","['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (SAMD9 protein, human)', '0 (SAMD9L protein, human)', '0 (Samd9L protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inppl1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'Chromosome 7, monosomy']","['Animals', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gain of Function Mutation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Syndrome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,PMC7880413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies to reduce recurrence are urgently required. Registry data have demonstrated improved outcomes using a sequential transplant regimen, fludarabine/amsacrine/cytarabine-busulphan (FLAMSA-Bu), but the impact of this intensified conditioning regimen has not been studied in randomized trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-four patients (median age, 59 years) with high-risk AML (n = 164) or MDS (n = 80) were randomly assigned 1:1 to a fludarabine-based RIC regimen or FLAMSA-Bu. Pretransplant measurable residual disease (MRD) was monitored by flow cytometry (MFC-MRD) and correlated with outcome. RESULTS: There was no difference in 2-year overall survival (hazard ratio 1.05 [85% CI, 0.80 to 1.38] P = .81) or cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (hazard ratio 0.94 [95%CI, 0.60 to 1.46] P = .81) between the control and FLAMSA-Bu arms. Detectable pretransplant MFC-MRD was associated with an increased CIR (2-year CIR 41.0% v 20.0%, P = .01) in the overall trial cohort with a comparable prognostic impact when measured by an unsupervised analysis approach. There was no evidence of interaction between MRD status and conditioning regimen intensity for relapse or survival. Acquisition of full donor T-cell chimerism at 3 months abrogated the adverse impact of pretransplant MRD on CIR and overall survival. CONCLUSION: The intensified RIC conditioning regimen, FLAMSA-Bu, did not improve outcomes in adults transplanted for high-risk AML or MDS regardless of pretransplant MRD status. Our data instead support the exploration of interventions with the ability to accelerate acquisition of full donor T-cell chimerism as a tractable strategy to improve outcomes in patients allografted for AML.","['Craddock, Charles', 'Jackson, Aimee', 'Loke, Justin', 'Siddique, Shamyla', 'Hodgkinson, Andrea', 'Mason, John', 'Andrew, Georgia', 'Nagra, Sandeep', 'Malladi, Ram', 'Peniket, Andrew', 'Gilleece, Maria', 'Salim, Rahuman', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Potter, Victoria', 'Crawley, Charles', 'Wheatley, Keith', 'Protheroe, Rachel', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Hunter, Ann', 'Parker, Anne', 'Wilson, Keith', 'Pavlu, Jiri', 'Byrne, Jenny', 'Dillon, Richard', 'Khan, Naeem', 'McCarthy, Nicholas', 'Freeman, Sylvie D']","['Craddock C', 'Jackson A', 'Loke J', 'Siddique S', 'Hodgkinson A', 'Mason J', 'Andrew G', 'Nagra S', 'Malladi R', 'Peniket A', 'Gilleece M', 'Salim R', 'Tholouli E', 'Potter V', 'Crawley C', 'Wheatley K', 'Protheroe R', 'Vyas P', 'Hunter A', 'Parker A', 'Wilson K', 'Pavlu J', 'Byrne J', 'Dillon R', 'Khan N', 'McCarthy N', 'Freeman SD']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5041-6678', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0725-069X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5871-2885', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0364-3573', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3931-0914', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4905-6860', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5219-5637', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9381-1851', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9333-5296', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1869-180X']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201229,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2020/12/30 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/12/29 17:08'],"['2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/29 17:08 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.02308 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Mar 1;39(7):768-778. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.02308.

Four sheep that had been inoculated with completely pasteurized milk containing approximately 3.4 x 10(7) BLV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and treated by either HTST pasteurization or laboratory-scale low-temperature long-time (LTLT) pasteurization (i.e., 60 degrees C for 30 min), remained negative for BLV for at least 17 weeks after inoculation. In contrast, all sheep inoculated with unpasteurized or inadequately pasteurized milk containing the same number of BLV-infected PBMC were tested positive for BLV and anti-BLV antibodies within 3 weeks after inoculation. These results suggest that on-farm continuous flow HTST pasteurization was equivalent value with inactivated BLV on the LTLT procedure and can effectively inactivate BLV in the milk. Therefore, on-farm HTST pasteurization of the pooled colostrum or milk used in automated feeding systems is likely to protect group-housed preweaned calves from BLV infection, thereby improving animal health on dairy farms.","['Tomita, Keisuke', 'Miyauchi, Sonoko', 'Katagiri, Yuzuru', 'Yoneyama, Syuji', 'Dongze, Leng', 'Chiba, Yusuke', 'Hirata, Toh-Ichi', 'Ichijo, Toshihiro', 'Yasuda, Hajime A', 'Hikono, Hirokazu', 'Murakami, Kenji']","['Tomita K', 'Miyauchi S', 'Katagiri Y', 'Yoneyama S', 'Dongze L', 'Chiba Y', 'Hirata TI', 'Ichijo T', 'Yasuda HA', 'Hikono H', 'Murakami K']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3813-818X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Anim Sci J,Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,100956805,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine leukemia virus', 'high-temperature short-time pasteurization', 'inactivation', 'milk']",2020/12/30 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/12/29 08:37'],"['2020/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 08:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/asj.13495 [doi]'],ppublish,Anim Sci J. 2020 Jan;91(1):e13495. doi: 10.1111/asj.13495.,20210201,['(c) 2020 Japanese Society of Animal Science.'],"['Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Field Science Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Research Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Sciences, Teikyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.']",,"['Animal Feed/*virology', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Dairying/*methods', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*prevention & control/*virology', '*Farms', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Milk/*virology', 'Pasteurization/*methods', 'Sheep', '*Temperature', 'Time Factors', '*Virus Inactivation']",,,['16818380/The NARO Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a general lack of software tools for gene fusion detection from long-read RNA-seq data, which takes into account the high basecalling error rates and the presence of alignment errors. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a fast computational tool, LongGF, to efficiently detect candidate gene fusions from long-read RNA-seq data, including cDNA sequencing data and direct mRNA sequencing data. We evaluated LongGF on tens of simulated long-read RNA-seq datasets, and demonstrated its superior performance in gene fusion detection. We also tested LongGF on a Nanopore direct mRNA sequencing dataset and a PacBio sequencing dataset generated on a mixture of 10 cancer cell lines, and found that LongGF achieved better performance to detect known gene fusions over existing computational tools. Furthermore, we tested LongGF on a Nanopore cDNA sequencing dataset on acute myeloid leukemia, and pinpointed the exact location of a translocation (previously known in cytogenetic resolution) in base resolution, which was further validated by Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, LongGF will greatly facilitate the discovery of candidate gene fusion events from long-read RNA-Seq data, especially in cancer samples.

Vascular malfunction and inflammatory processes further contribute to the thrombotic activation process in these patients. Andexanet alfa (AA) is an antidote for factor Xa inhibitors and its usage has been reported with thrombotic complications. This study was designed to compare the effect of AA on the thrombin generation (TG) potential. Blood samples from 78 patients with confirmed diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were collected from the University of Belgrade Clinic, Serbia. Normal human plasma (NHP) was used for referencing purposes. Individual samples were supplemented with AA at 100 ug/ml. TG studies were carried out using a commercially available fluorogenic substrate method. TG parameters such as peak thrombin (PT), lag time (LT) and area under the curve (AUC) were compiled. Cumulatively, lymphoma patients showed an increase in LT compared to NHP which decreases with AA. The PT and AUC levels were decreased compared to NHP and increases with AA. Upon sub-grouping of lymphoma patients, PT levels for all sub-groups were increased with AA. The AUC values increased for HL and NHL and decreased for CLL with AA. Variations in lag time were noted in all 3 sub-groups. Lymphoma represents a heterogenous group of patients where both the hypercoagulable state and inflammatory responses simultaneously occur. Increased thrombin generation in post AA supplemented samples suggest that the use of this agent may potentially be associated with thrombotic complications.","['Siddiqui, Fakiha', 'Antic, Darko', 'Tafur, Alfonso', 'Bontekoe, Emily', 'Hoppensteadt, Debra', 'Gerotziafas, Grigoris', 'Elalamy, Ismail', 'Fareed, Jawed']","['Siddiqui F', 'Antic D', 'Tafur A', 'Bontekoe E', 'Hoppensteadt D', 'Gerotziafas G', 'Elalamy I', 'Fareed J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2219-7049', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-1721', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9342-4213', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2316-6348', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3465-2499']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['andexanet alfa', 'cancer associated thrombosis (CAT)', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'venous thromboembolism (VTE)']",2020/12/30 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/12/29 08:36'],"['2020/12/29 08:36 [entrez]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1076029620983466 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2020 Jan-Dec;26:1076029620983466. doi: 10.1177/1076029620983466.,20210730,,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Hemostasis and Thrombosis Research Division, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL, USA.', 'Head of Intensive care unit, Lymphoma Centre, Clinic for Hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Northshore Cardiovascular Institute, NorthShore University Health Systems, Skokie, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Hemostasis and Thrombosis Research Division, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Hemostasis and Thrombosis Research Division, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL, USA.', ""Head of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Unit, Co-Chair of Thrombosis Center, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Tenon, University Hospital, France."", 'Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, INSERM U938 and Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Tenon UPMC EA3499, Paris, France."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Hemostasis and Thrombosis Research Division, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL, USA.']","['0 (PRT064445)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)']","['Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Factor Xa/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*blood/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/complications', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Thrombin/analysis', 'Thrombosis/blood/chemically induced/etiology']",,,,PMC7783880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its expression and clinical significance in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remain unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the expression of MEG3 in APL and explore its clinical value. METHODS: A total of 287 AML patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Vizome database were enrolled. A development and validation cohort, including APL, AML with AML1/ETO, and other types of AML patients and disease controls, from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, were also enrolled in this study. The correlation between MEG3 expression and the clinicopathological features in APL was investigated. The diagnostic values of MEG3 expression in APL were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULT: In the development set, MEG3 expression was significantly increased in APL than AML with AML1/ETO, other types of AML, and disease controls, which was consistent with the results from the database analysis. MEG3 expression in APL was associated with age (P = .0053) but did not correlate with other clinicopathological features (P > .05). ROC curve analysis in the development set and diagnostic test analysis in the validation set suggested that MEG3 expression has a significant value in the diagnosis of APL. Furthermore, the expression of MEG3 decreased during the follow-up of patients with negative PML/RARalpha fusion gene. CONCLUSION: MEG3 serves as a novel marker for the diagnosis of APL, evaluates the curative effect, and provides a novel direction for further research.","['Jiang, Mei', 'Wang, Qiufeng', 'Yu, Ganquan', 'Wan, Jinghua', 'Liu, Shuyuan', 'Zhang, Zhanglin', 'Le, Aiping']","['Jiang M', 'Wang Q', 'Yu G', 'Wan J', 'Liu S', 'Zhang Z', 'Le A']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4128-4903'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20201229,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'clinical significance', 'diagnosis', 'lncRNA', 'maternally expressed gene 3']",2020/12/30 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2020/12/29 06:07'],"['2020/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/29 06:07 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13438 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Aug;43(4):693-698. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13438.

However, there are a number of critical statistical challenges in the inference of such networks from high-throughput data. Since the abundances in each sample are constrained to have a fixed sum and there is incomplete overlap in microbial populations across subjects, the data are both compositional and zero-inflated. RESULTS: We propose the COmpositional Zero-Inflated Network Estimation (COZINE) method for inference of microbial networks which addresses these critical aspects of the data while maintaining computational scalability. COZINE relies on the multivariate Hurdle model to infer a sparse set of conditional dependencies which reflect not only relationships among the continuous values, but also among binary indicators of presence or absence and between the binary and continuous representations of the data. Our simulation results show that the proposed method is better able to capture various types of microbial relationships than existing approaches. We demonstrate the utility of the method with an application to understanding the oral microbiome network in a cohort of leukemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method addresses important challenges in microbiome network estimation, and can be effectively applied to discover various types of dependence relationships in microbial communities.

In this retrospective, single-centre, observational study, we present our eight-year experience of antifungal prophylaxis using intermittent high-dose liposomal Amphotericin B (L-AmB). All adults identified through our Antifungal Stewardship Programme as receiving L-AmB prophylaxis at 7.5 mg/kg once-weekly between February 2012 and January 2020 were included. Adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, electrolyte loss, and nephrotoxicity, were recorded. 'Breakthrough' invasive fungal infection (IFI) occurring within four weeks of L-AmB was classified using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Moreover, 114 courses of intermittent high-dose L-AmB prophylaxis administered to 92 unique patients were analysed. Hypokalaemia was the most common grade 3-4 adverse event, with 26 (23%) courses. Grade 3 nephrotoxicity occurred in 8 (7%) and reversed in all six patients surviving to 90 days. There were two (1.8%) episodes of breakthrough IFI, one 'probable' and one 'possible'. In this study, the largest evaluation of intermittent high-dose L-AmB prophylaxis conducted to date, toxicity was manageable and reversible and breakthrough IFI was rare. L-AmB prophylaxis represents a viable alternative for patients with a contraindication to triazoles.","['Youngs, Jonathan', 'Low, Jen Mae', 'Whitney, Laura', 'Logan, Clare', 'Chase, Janice', 'Yau, Ting', 'Klammer, Matthias', 'Koh, Mickey', 'Bicanic, Tihana']","['Youngs J', 'Low JM', 'Whitney L', 'Logan C', 'Chase J', 'Yau T', 'Klammer M', 'Koh M', 'Bicanic T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8781-2615', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6689-0320', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4368-2502']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201221,Switzerland,J Fungi (Basel),"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",101671827,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukaemia', 'amphotericin B', 'antifungal prophylaxis', 'graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)', 'hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT)', 'triazoles']",2020/12/30 06:00,2020/12/30 06:01,['2020/12/29 01:04'],"['2020/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['jof6040385 [pii]', '10.3390/jof6040385 [doi]']",epublish,J Fungi (Basel). 2020 Dec 21;6(4). pii: jof6040385. doi: 10.3390/jof6040385.,,,"[""Institute of Infection & Immunity, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, Tooting, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""Department of Infection, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Clinical Academic Group in Infection and Immunity, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Pharmacy Department, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Institute of Infection & Immunity, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, Tooting, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""Department of Infection, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Clinical Academic Group in Infection and Immunity, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""Pharmacy Department, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Pharmacy Department, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Department of Haematology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Clinical Academic Group in Infection and Immunity, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""Department of Haematology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Institute of Infection & Immunity, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, Tooting, London SW17 0RE, UK."", ""Department of Infection, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackshaw Rd, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK."", ""Clinical Academic Group in Infection and Immunity, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0RE, UK.""]",,,,,['07512/Gilead UK and Ireland Corporate Contributions'],PMC7767522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the pharmacophore identified in this lead compound (i.e., ""lipophilic group"", ""di-substituted guanidine"", ""phenylguanidine polar end""), several modifications were investigated to improve its cytotoxicity in different cancer cell lines. Thus, several lipophilic groups were explored, the di-substituted guanidine was replaced by a secondary amine and the phenyl ring in the polar end was substituted by a pyridine. In a structure-based design approach, four representative derivatives were docked into an in-house model of an active triphosphate-containing BRAF protein, and the interactions established were analysed. Based on these computational studies, a variety of derivatives was synthesized, and their predicted drug-like properties calculated. Next, the effect on cell viability of these compounds was assessed in cell line models of promyelocytic leukaemia and breast, cervical and colorectal carcinomas. The potential of a selection of these compounds as apoptotic agents was assessed by screening in the promyelocytic leukaemia cell line HL-60. The toxicity against non-tumorigenic epithelial MCF10A cells was also investigated. These studies allowed for several structure-activity relationships to be derived. Investigations on the mechanism of action of representative compounds suggest a divergent effect on inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway.","['Previtali, Viola', 'Mihigo, Helene B', 'Amet, Rebecca', 'McElligott, Anthony M', 'Zisterer, Daniela M', 'Rozas, Isabel']","['Previtali V', 'Mihigo HB', 'Amet R', 'McElligott AM', 'Zisterer DM', 'Rozas I']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5396-336X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3276-1341', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6658-6038']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201221,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,['NOTNLM'],"[""3,4'-bis-guanidino"", ""3-amino-4'-guanidino"", 'BRAF', 'HL-60', 'apoptosis', 'cancer cell viability', 'diphenyl ether', 'intramolecular hydrogen bond', 'phenyl pyridyl ether']",2020/12/30 06:00,2020/12/30 06:01,['2020/12/29 01:04'],"['2020/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['ph13120485 [pii]', '10.3390/ph13120485 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2020 Dec 21;13(12). pii: ph13120485. doi: 10.3390/ph13120485.,,,"['School of Chemistry, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), 152-160 Pearse Street, D02R590 Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Chemistry, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), 152-160 Pearse Street, D02R590 Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), 152-160 Pearse Street, D02R590 Dublin 2, Ireland.', ""Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College and St James's Hospital, D02R590 Dublin 8, Ireland."", 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), 152-160 Pearse Street, D02R590 Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Chemistry, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI), Trinity College Dublin (TCD), 152-160 Pearse Street, D02R590 Dublin 2, Ireland.']",,,,,"['V.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the disruption of specific chromatin-associated protein complexes has therapeutic potential in malignant conditions, particularly those that are driven by aberrant chromatin modifiers. Of note, a number of enzymatic inhibitors that block the catalytic function of histone modifying enzymes have been established and entered clinical trials. Unfortunately, many of these molecules do not have potent single-agent activity. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is the fact that those drugs do not profoundly disrupt the integrity of the aberrant network of multiprotein complexes on chromatin. Recent advances in drug development have led to the establishment of novel inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as well as targeted protein degraders that may provide inroads to longstanding effort to physically disrupt oncogenic multiprotein complexes on chromatin. In this review, we summarize some of the current concepts on the role epigenetic modifiers in malignant chromatin states with a specific focus on myeloid malignancies and recent advances in early-phase clinical trials.","['Perner, Florian', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Perner F', 'Armstrong SA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201221,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BRD4', '*BRD9', '*DOT1L', '*EZH2', '*KMT2A', '*LSD1', '*MLL1', '*Menin', '*PPI', '*PROTAC', '*acetylation', '*chromatin', '*degradation', '*epigenetics', '*methylation', '*transcription']",2020/12/30 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/12/29 01:03'],"['2020/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9122721 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9122721 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Dec 21;9(12). pii: cells9122721. doi: 10.3390/cells9122721.,20210709,,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Internal Medicine II, Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich Schiller University Medical Center, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Code', 'Histone Demethylases/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA206963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA176745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7767226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to design this meta-analysis to discuss the incidence and prognostic effect of nucleolar phosphoprotein 1 (NPM1) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene internal tandem (FLT3-ITD) gene in AML patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane library were systematically searched due to May 15, 2020. Four combinations of genotypes (FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut, FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1mut, FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1wt, FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1wt) were compared in association with the overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) outcome, which expressed as pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included in our study. The incidence of FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut, FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1mut, FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1wt, and FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1wt was 16%, 13%, 50%, and 10%, respectively. The patients with FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut gene may have the best OS and LFS when comparing with FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1mut (HR = 1.94 and 1.70, P < .01), FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1wt (HR = 1.57 and 2.09, P < .01), and FLT3-ITDpos/NPM1wt (HR = 2.25 and 2.84, P < .001). CONCLUSION: AML patients with FLT3-ITDneg/NPM1mut gene type have the best survival outcome than the other 3 gene types, which should be an independent genotyping in AML classification.","['Liu, Heping', 'Zhang, Xiaolian', 'Li, Ming', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Jiang, Guangrong', 'Yin, Weihua', 'Song, Chunping']","['Liu H', 'Zhang X', 'Li M', 'Zhou W', 'Jiang G', 'Yin W', 'Song C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3551-0580'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,,2020/12/30 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/12/29 01:03'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000023707 [doi]', '00005792-202012180-00064 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Dec 18;99(51):e23707. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000023707.,20210119,"['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

Basic science, clinical, and observational studies have produced conflicting results. The authors examined the association between prescription opioids and incident cancers using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. A complex relation was observed between prescription opioids and incident cancer, and cancer site may be an important determinant. METHODS: By using linked SEER cancer registry and Medicare claims from 2008 through 2013, a case-control study was conducted examining the relation between cancer onset and prior opioid exposure. Logistic regression was used to account for differences between cases and controls for 10 cancer sites. RESULTS: Of the population studied (n = 348,319), 34% were prescribed opioids, 79.5% were white, 36.9% were dually eligible (for both Medicare and Medicaid), 13% lived in a rural area, 52.7% had >/=1 comorbidity, and 16% had a smoking-related diagnosis. Patients exposed to opioids had a lower odds ratio (OR) associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99) and colon cancer (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93) compared with controls.

However, whether high-income US citizens have better health outcomes than average individuals in other developed countries is unknown. Objective: To assess whether the health outcomes of White US citizens living in the 1% and 5% richest counties (hereafter referred to as privileged White US citizens) are better than the health outcomes of average residents in other developed countries. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study, conducted from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, identified White US citizens living in the 1% (n = 32) and 5% (n = 157) highest-income counties in the US and measured the following 6 health outcomes associated with health care interventions: infant and maternal mortality, colon and breast cancer, childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia, and acute myocardial infarction. The study used Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data, CONCORD-3 cancer data, and Medicare data to compare their outcomes with all residents in 12 other developed countries: Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Statistical analysis took place from July 25, 2017, to August 29, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Infant mortality; maternal mortality; 5-year survival of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, or childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia; and 30-day age-standardized case fatality after acute myocardial infarction. Results: The infant mortality rate among White US citizens in the 5% highest-income counties was 4.01 per 1000, and the maternal mortality rate among White US citizens in the 5% highest-income counties was 10.85 per 100000, both higher than the mean rates for any of the 12 comparison countries. (The infant mortality rate for the top 1% counties was 3.54 per 1000, and the maternal mortality rate was 10.05 per 100000.) The 5-year survival rate for White US citizens in the 5% highest-income counties was 67.2% (95% CI, 66.7%-67.7%) for colon cancer, higher than that of average US citizens (64.9% [95% CI, 64.7%-65.1%]) and average citizens in 6 countries, comparable with that of average citizens in 4 countries, and lower than that of average citizens for 2 countries. The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer among White US women in the 5% highest-income US counties was 92.0% (95% CI, 91.6%-92.4%), higher than in all 12 comparison countries. The 5-year survival rate for White children with acute lymphocytic leukemia in the 5% highest-income US counties was 92.6% (95% CI, 90.7%-94.2%), exceeding the mean survival rate for only 1 country and comparable with the mean survival rates in 11 countries. The adjusted 30-day acute myocardial infarction case-fatality rate for White US citizens in the 5% highest-income US counties was 8% below the rate for all US citizens and was 5% below the rate for all US citizens in the 1% highest-income US counties; these estimates were similar to the median outcome of other high-income countries. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that privileged White US citizens have better health outcomes than average US citizens for 6 health outcomes but often fare worse than the mean measure of health outcomes of 12 other developed countries. These findings imply that even if all US citizens experienced the same health outcomes enjoyed by privileged White US citizens, US health indicators would still lag behind those in many other countries.","['Emanuel, Ezekiel J', 'Gudbranson, Emily', 'Van Parys, Jessica', 'Gortz, Mette', 'Helgeland, Jon', 'Skinner, Jonathan']","['Emanuel EJ', 'Gudbranson E', 'Van Parys J', 'Gortz M', 'Helgeland J', 'Skinner J']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,JAMA Intern Med,JAMA internal medicine,101589534,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2020/12/28 13:15'],"['2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 13:15 [entrez]']","['2774561 [pii]', '10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.7484 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Intern Med. 2021 Mar 1;181(3):339-344. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.7484.,20220110,,"['Department of Medial Ethics and Health Policy, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Department of Healthcare Management, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Department of Medial Ethics and Health Policy, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Economics and Accounting, Hunter College, CUNY, New York, New York.', 'Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division for Health Services, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Economics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire.', 'Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine, Lebanon, New Hampshire.']",,"['Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Developed Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Infant Mortality', '*Maternal Mortality', 'Myocardial Infarction/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Pregnancy', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",,,,PMC7770612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the NAT2 genotype/phenotype is not fully understood and few studies have reported its relationship with CML. The aim of this study was to determine whether its polymorphisms (C481T, G590A, 803A>G and 857G>A) have a role in chronic myeloid leukemia susceptibility (CML) in Sudanese population. METHODS: We performed a case- control study. DNA from 200 CML patients and 100 controls was analyzed for the NAT2 polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP assay. RESULTS: The study showed NAT2 polymorphisms 803AG are associated with CML protection by a factor of 2.3, (OR = 0.044, 95% CI: 0.020-0.095, p = 0. 000). The study indicated that the heterozygous (GA) and mutant (AA) variants of the G857A genotype also offer protection, (OR = 0.002, 95% CI: 0.002-0.019, p = 0. 000) and (OR = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.002-0.133, p = 0. 000), respectively. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in CML diagnosis among Sudanese cases with the 481C-->T and 590G-->A polymorphisms. But patients with the compound NAT2 genotypes 481CT/803 AG, 590AG/ 803AG, 590AG/ 803GG, 590AA/ 803AG and 590GG/ 803AG were found to have a reduced risk. The current study demonstrates that polymorphisms of NAT2 A803G and G857A might also act as protective factors against developing the disease.","['Tebien, Entesar M', 'Khalil, Hiba B', 'Mills, Jeremy', 'Elderdery, Abozer Y']","['Tebien EM', 'Khalil HB', 'Mills J', 'Elderdery AY']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6219-5312'],['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20201201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CML. xenobiotic metabolism', 'NAT2', 'Single nucleotide polymorphism', 'Sudanese']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/12/28 13:14'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 13:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3711 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Dec 1;21(12):3711-3717. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3711.,20210901,,"['Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Department oF Hematology, Al Neelain University, Sudan.', 'Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Shaqra University, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al Neelain Stem Cell Center, Al Neelain University, Sudan.', 'School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth, UK.', 'Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Jouf University, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology, University of El Imam El Mahdi, Sudan.']","['EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (NAT2 protein, human)']","['Acetylation', 'Adult', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis']",,,,PMC8046315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the major cause of the recurrence and metastasis of ALL. This study aimed to develop an effective anti-cancer agent targeting these LSCs. Luffa Cylindrica (L.C.) leaves extract was selected to evaluate its effect on ALL via eradicating the LSCs as it contains many active anti-cancer flavonoids. METHODS: Thirty-two bone marrow samples of ALL patients were used in this study. LSCs population was identified in the selected samples. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation marker; ki-67 and colony forming assay were further analyzed. RESULTS: This study revealed the expression of CD34+/CD38+ cells in addition to CD34+/CD38- population and the extract was effective against the two LSCs populations. MTT assay showed that treated leukemic cells exhibited significant reduction in the viable cells in a dose dependent manner with IC50 of 3 microg/microl which was then confirmed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis results showed significant reduction in the percentage of cells treated with L.C. extract in both the S and G0/G1 phases, with concomitant increase in the G2/M phase. Also, L.C. extract could effectively induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation and suppress colonogenecity of leukemic cells. CONCLUSION: This study validated the medicinal potential of L.C. leaves extract as a promising anti-leukemic agent targeting both LSCs and blasts in ALL patients, which may be explained by the synergy found between its potent flavonoids especially apigenin, luteolin and kaempferol.","['Yehia, Shimaa', 'Abdel-Salam, Ibrahim M', 'Elgamal, Basma M', 'El-Agamy, Basma', 'Hamdy, Germine M', 'Aldouski, Hala M']","['Yehia S', 'Abdel-Salam IM', 'Elgamal BM', 'El-Agamy B', 'Hamdy GM', 'Aldouski HM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'CD34/CD38', 'Luffa cylindrica', 'leukemic stem cells']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/12/28 13:14'],"['2020/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 13:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3661 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Dec 1;21(12):3661-3668. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3661.,20210901,,"['Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Cancer Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Luffa/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry', 'Young Adult']",,,,PMC8046306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To explore the status of GPX3 expression and analyze its clinical characteristics and prognosis in a cohort of Egyptian patients with AML. METHODS: GPX3 mRNA level was assessed by RT-q PCR in 40 newly diagnosed AML patients and 10 healthy controls. RESULTS: The gene expression level was significantly lower in AML patients than the control group (P < 0.001). A cut off value (0.1223) for the discrimination between AML and controls was obtained by ROC curve. According to this cutoff value; the patients were reassigned into 2 groups; 28 patients with lower GPX3 expression and 12 patients with high GPX3 expression. GPX3low expression was significantly associated with higher incidence of induction death (P= 0.037) and lower CR rate (P=0.048). Moreover, GPX3low expression was significantly associated with shorter cumulative 1-year overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.028). CONCLUSION: GPX3low expression status is considered a poor prognostic factor in AML predicting shorter OS and DFS. The study highlights the importance of targeting glutathione metabolism as a central component of the anti-leukemia therapy.","['Shaaban, Yasmine', 'Aref, Salah', 'Taalab, Mona', 'Ayed, Mohamed', 'Mabed, Mohamed']","['Shaaban Y', 'Aref S', 'Taalab M', 'Ayed M', 'Mabed M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4822-5204'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), hematologic malignancies, prognosis', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/12/28 13:14'],"['2020/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 13:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3567 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Dec 1;21(12):3567-3572. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3567.,20210901,,"['Clinical Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'The Hematology Unit, Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'The Hematology Unit, Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (GPX3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)']","['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,,,PMC8046308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL mutations are the cause of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance in CML. Recently, compound BCR-ABL mutations have been reported to resist all FDA approved TKIs. Therefore, finding novel compound BCR-ABL mutations can help and clinically manage CML. Therefore, our objective was to find out novel drug-resistant compound BCR-ABL mutations in CML and carry out their protein modelling studies. METHODOLOGY: Peripheral blood samples were collected from ten imatinib resistant CML patients receiving nilotinib treatment. BCR-ABL transcript mutations were investigated by employing capillary sequencing. Patient follow-up was carried out using European LeukemiaNet guidelines. Protein modeling studies were carried out for new compound mutations using PyMol to see the effects of mutations at structural level. RESULTS: A novel compound mutation (K245N mutation along with G250W mutation) and previously known T351I utation was detected in two of the nilotinib resistance CML patients respectively while in the rest of 8 nilotinib responders, no resistant mutations were detected. Protein modelling studies indicated changes in BCR-ABL mutant protein which may have negatively impacted its binding with nilotinib leading to drug resistance. CONCLUSION: We report a novel nilotinib resistant BCR-ABL compound mutation (K245N along with G250W mutation) which impacts structural modification in BCR-ABL mutant protein leading to drug resistance. As compound mutations pose a new threat by causing resistance to all FDA approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors in BCR-ABL+ leukemias, our study opens a new direction for in vitro characterization of novel BCR-ABL compound mutations and their resistant to second generation and third generation TKIs.","['Iqbal, Zafar', 'Absar, Muhammad', 'Mahmood, Amer', 'Aleem, Aamer', 'Iqbal, Mudassar', 'Jameel, Abid', 'Akhtar, Tanveer', 'Karim, Sajjad', 'Rasool, Mahmood', 'Mirza, Zeenat', 'Khalid, Muhammad', 'Akram, Afia Muhammad', 'Sabar, Muhammad Farooq', 'Khalid, Ahmad M', 'Aljarrah, Khalid', 'Iqbal, Janhangir', 'Khalid, Muhammad', 'Shah, Ijaz H', 'Alanazi, Nawaf']","['Iqbal Z', 'Absar M', 'Mahmood A', 'Aleem A', 'Iqbal M', 'Jameel A', 'Akhtar T', 'Karim S', 'Rasool M', 'Mirza Z', 'Khalid M', 'Akram AM', 'Sabar MF', 'Khalid AM', 'Aljarrah K', 'Iqbal J', 'Khalid M', 'Shah IH', 'Alanazi N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL Mutation', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Nilotinib', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/12/28 13:14'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 13:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3517 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Dec 1;21(12):3517-3526. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3517.,20210901,,"['Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetics Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, & University of Education, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetics Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, & University of Education, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Hematology/Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Foreign Faculty, Asian Medical Institute, Kant City, National Surgical Centre, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and Higher Education Commission Program in ""Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetics Engineering Sciences (HOPES)"", Kyrgyzstan.', 'Post-Graduate Medical Institute, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetics Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, & University of Education, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research & Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research & Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research & Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Blood Bank, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Department of Zoology, Division of Science and Technology, University of Education, Township, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Centre for Advanced Molecular Biology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Departments of Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine, University of Sialkot, Pakistan.', 'College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS)/ KAIMRC/SSBMT, National Guards Health Affairs, Al-Ahsa, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.', 'National Guard Health Affairs, King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre (KAIMRC), Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.', 'Allied Hospital, Punjab Medical College & Sahil Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan.', 'Allied Hospital, Punjab Medical College & Sahil Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan.', 'College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS)/ KAIMRC/SSBMT, National Guards Health Affairs, Al-Ahsa, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Molecular', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",,,,PMC8046299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of CNA in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and correlate these findings with clinical outcome. METHODS: DNA extracted from peripheral blood or bone marrow at diagnosis/relapse of fifty newly diagnosed children with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was analyzed for CNA with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. RESULTS: The analysis revealed 76 CNA in 24 patients most frequently found in PAR1 (17%), CDKN2A/B (15.7%) and PAX5 (14.4%) genes. There were significant CNA co-occurrences between PAX5, CDKN2A/B, BTG1, ETV6, PAR1 or XP22 genes, (p <0.020) and the high-risk group. There was a significant correlation between EBF1, RB1, and IKZF1 alterations and bone marrow relapse. Patients with CNA in screened genes are more likely to succumb to their disease except for those with PAR1 or XP22 genes (p <0.050). CONCLUSION: The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification could be considered as an independent diagnostic tool allowing prompt identification of patients at high risk of treatment failure and, subsequently, a more adequate treatment approach.","['Hosein Pour Feizi, Abbasali', 'Zeinali, Sirous', 'Toporski, Jacek', 'Sheervalilou, Roghayeh', 'Mehranfar, Sahar']","['Hosein Pour Feizi A', 'Zeinali S', 'Toporski J', 'Sheervalilou R', 'Mehranfar S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CDKN2A/B', 'Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'PAX5', 'copy number alterations (CNA)', 'multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/12/28 13:14'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 13:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3493 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Dec 1;21(12):3493-3500. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.12.3493.,20210901,,"['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Kawsar Human Genetics Research Center, Kawsar Genomics Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden.', 'Pharmacology Research Center, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran.', 'Social Determinate of Health Research Center, Clinical Research Institute Urmia University of Medical Science, Urmia, Iran.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']","['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,,PMC8046302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have investigated solvation properties of substrate GMP or product inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP)-binding pocket of hGMPR by employing molecular dynamics simulations on conformations A (substrate GMP), B [substrate GMP with cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NDP)], C (product IMP with cofactor NDP), and D (product IMP). Nineteen water sites are identified precisely; they are responsible for the catalytic activity of this site, control structural and dynamical integrity, and electronic consequences of GMP or IMP in the binding site of hGMPR. The water sites of category-1 (W1, W4, W5, W6, W13, and W15) in normal protein and category-2 (W2, W3, W7, W8, W10, W17, and W18) in cancerous protein are unique and stabilize the guanosine or inosine group of GMP or IMP for participation in the enzymatic reaction, whereas the remaining water centers either stabilize pentose sugar ribose or the phosphate group of GMP or IMP. Furthermore, water sites of category-4 (W11, W14, and W16) appear to be conserved in all conformations during the entire simulation. The GMP-binding site in cancerous protein 2C6Q is significantly expanded, and its dynamics are very different from normal protein 2BLE. Furthermore, unique interactions of GMP(N1)...W2...Asp129/Asn158, IMP(N1)...W3...Glu289, and IMP(O6)...W10...Ser270 might be used in a water mimic drug design for hGMPR-II. In this context, water finding probability, relative interaction energy (J) associated with water site W, entropy, and topologies of these three water sites are thermodynamically acceptable for the water displacement method by the modified ligand. Hence, their positions in the catalytic pocket may also facilitate future drug discovery for chronic myelogenous leukemia by the design of appropriately oriented chemical groups that may displace these water molecules to mimic their structural, electronic, and thermodynamic properties.","['Bairagya, Hridoy R', 'Tasneem, Alvea', 'Rai, Gyan Prakash', 'Reyaz, Saima']","['Bairagya HR', 'Tasneem A', 'Rai GP', 'Reyaz S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2117-6764'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201228,United States,J Phys Chem B,The journal of physical chemistry.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the oral formulation of azacitidine (CC-486, a hypomethylating agent that is not bioequivalent to injectable azacitidine), as maintenance therapy in patients with AML who were in first remission after intensive chemotherapy. Patients who were 55 years of age or older, were in complete remission with or without complete blood count recovery, and were not candidates for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation were randomly assigned to receive CC-486 (300 mg) or placebo once daily for 14 days per 28-day cycle. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 472 patients underwent randomization; 238 were assigned to the CC-486 group and 234 were assigned to the placebo group. The median age was 68 years (range, 55 to 86). Median overall survival from the time of randomization was significantly longer with CC-486 than with placebo (24.7 months and 14.8 months, respectively; P<0.001). Median relapse-free survival was also significantly longer with CC-486 than with placebo (10.2 months and 4.8 months, respectively; P<0.001). Benefits of CC-486 with respect to overall and relapse-free survival were shown in most subgroups defined according to baseline characteristics. The most common adverse events in both groups were grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events. Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (in 41% of patients in the CC-486 group and 24% of patients in the placebo group) and thrombocytopenia (in 22% and 21%, respectively). Overall health-related quality of life was preserved during CC-486 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CC-486 maintenance therapy was associated with significantly longer overall and relapse-free survival than placebo among older patients with AML who were in remission after chemotherapy. Side effects were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms and neutropenia. Quality-of-life measures were maintained throughout treatment.

The molecular and phenotypic characteristics of AML are highly heterogeneous. Our previous study concluded that CaMKIIgamma was the trigger of chronic myeloid leukaemia progression from the chronic phase to blast crisis, but how CaMKIIgamma influences AML stem-like cells remains elusive. In this study, we found that CaMKIIgamma was overexpressed in AML patients and AML cell lines, as measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. Moreover, CaMKIIgamma decreased when the disease was in remission. Using an shRNA lentivirus expression system, we established CaMKIIgamma stable-knockdown AML cell lines and found that knockdown of CaMKIIgamma inhibited the viability and self-renewal of AML stem-like cell lines. Additionally, the ratio of CD34 (+) AML cell lines decreased, and CaMKIIgamma knockdown induced the downregulation of Alox5 levels. We further detected downstream molecules of the Alox5/NF-kappaB pathway and found that c-myc and p-IkappaBalpha decreased while total IkappaBalpha remained normal. In conclusion, our study describes a new role for CaMKIIgamma as a stem-like cell marker that is highly regulated by the Alox5/NF-kappaB pathway in AML stem-like cells. CaMKIIgamma can participate in the viability and self-renewal of AML stem-like cells by regulating the Alox5/NF-kappaB pathway.","['Cheng, Jiang-Hua', 'Zhang, Wen-Jing', 'Zhu, Jun-Feng', 'Cui, Di', 'Song, Kai-Di', 'Qiang, Ping', 'Mei, Chuan-Zhong', 'Nie, Zheng-Chao', 'Ding, Bang-Sheng', 'Han, Zhong', 'Ding, Zhi-En', 'Zheng, Wei-Wei']","['Cheng JH', 'Zhang WJ', 'Zhu JF', 'Cui D', 'Song KD', 'Qiang P', 'Mei CZ', 'Nie ZC', 'Ding BS', 'Han Z', 'Ding ZE', 'Zheng WW']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8657-4210'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201225,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Alox5', 'CaMKIIgamma', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'self-renewal']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:43'],"['2020/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:43 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13440 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Aug;43(4):699-706. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13440.

Indeed, the role of cytokines, in the pathophysiology and response to therapy of AML patients, remains under investigation. Here, we report on the impact of peripheral levels of two cytokines, the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FL) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), evaluated during first-line intensive induction. A new risk stratification can be proposed, which supersedes the ELN 2017 classification to predict survivals in AML patients by examining the kinetic profile of these cytokines during the induction phase.

Based on an aberrant expression on immunophenotypically defined hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), several antigens have been proposed as LSC markers in AML research, using healthy adult BM samples as reference material. Generally, these antigens have been evaluated individually in smaller panels (e.g. 8-color panels). This necessitates several tubes to characterize the LSC phenotype and compromises the ability to evaluate LSC heterogeneity. The present 15-color OMIP incorporates nine suggested LSC markers to comprehensively capture LSC immunophenotypes and to explore heterogenic marker-patterns within LSC populations in a single tube. Importantly, this single tube approach requires less input material, which is essential when sampling BM aspirates from pediatric patients where sample volumes often are sparse. As knowledge on normal expression levels of the included LSC markers in HSCs from hematologically healthy children are a prerequisite for labelling a phenotype as abnormal, we have evaluated the applicability of the panel on cryopreserved mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolated from BM samples from pediatric patients without hematological disorders as well as pediatric AML patients. The panel is optimized for cryopreserved BM MNCs, but could in principle, be utilized for LSC detection in any biological material containing human hematopoietic cells.","['Petersen, Marianne A', 'Bill, Marie', 'Rosenberg, Carina A']","['Petersen MA', 'Bill M', 'Rosenberg CA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2839-5804', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9609-8991']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201226,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

When performed with multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), assessment of residual leukemic cells after HSCT may be limited by therapy-induced shifts in the immunophenotype (e.g., loss of surface molecules used for therapeutic targeting). However, in such cases, questionable cells can be isolated and tested for hematopoietic chimerism to clarify their origin. METHODS: Questionable cell populations were detected during the MFC-based MRD monitoring of 52 follow-up bone marrow samples from 37 patients diagnosed with T cell neoplasms (n =14), B cell precursor ALL (n = 16), AML (n = 7). These cells (suspected leukemic or normal) were isolated by flow cell sorting and tested for hematopoietic chimerism by RTQ-PCR. RESULTS: The origin of cells was successfully identified in 96.15% of cases (n = 50), which helped to validate the results of MFC-based MRD monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that a combination of MFC, cell sorting, and chimerism testing may help confirm or disprove MRD presence in complicated cases after HSCT.","['Semchenkova, Alexandra', 'Brilliantova, Varvara', 'Shelikhova, Larisa', 'Zhogov, Vladimir', 'Illarionova, Olga', 'Mikhailova, Ekaterina', 'Raykina, Elena', 'Skorobogatova, Elena', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Maschan, Alexey', 'Maschan, Michael', 'Popov, Alexander']","['Semchenkova A', 'Brilliantova V', 'Shelikhova L', 'Zhogov V', 'Illarionova O', 'Mikhailova E', 'Raykina E', 'Skorobogatova E', 'Novichkova G', 'Maschan A', 'Maschan M', 'Popov A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7082-1694'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201228,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The main driver event of this disease is a nonrandom aneuploidy consisting of gains of whole chromosomes but without overt evidence of chromosomal instability (CIN). Here, we investigated the frequency and severity of defective sister chromatid cohesion-a phenomenon related to CIN-in primary pediatric ALL. We found that a large proportion (86%) of hyperdiploid cases displayed aberrant cohesion, frequently severe, to compare with 49% of ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL, which mostly displayed mild defects. In hyperdiploid ALL, cohesion defects were associated with increased chromosomal copy number heterogeneity, which could indicate increased CIN. Furthermore, cohesion defects correlated with RAD21 and NCAPG mRNA expression, suggesting a link to reduced cohesin and condensin levels in hyperdiploid ALL. Knockdown of RAD21 in an ALL cell line led to sister chromatid cohesion defects, aberrant mitoses, and increased heterogeneity in chromosomal copy numbers, similar to what was seen in primary hyperdiploid ALL. In summary, our study shows that aberrant sister chromatid cohesion is frequent but heterogeneous in pediatric high hyperdiploid ALL, ranging from mild to very severe defects, and possibly due to low cohesin or condensin levels. Cases with high levels of aberrant chromosome cohesion displayed increased chromosomal copy number heterogeneity, possibly indicative of increased CIN. These abnormalities may play a role in the clonal evolution of hyperdiploid pediatric ALL.","['Moura-Castro, Larissa H', 'Pena-Martinez, Pablo', 'Castor, Anders', 'Galeev, Roman', 'Larsson, Jonas', 'Jaras, Marcus', 'Yang, Minjun', 'Paulsson, Kajsa']","['Moura-Castro LH', 'Pena-Martinez P', 'Castor A', 'Galeev R', 'Larsson J', 'Jaras M', 'Yang M', 'Paulsson K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9063-5592', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0789-6431', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7950-222X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210116,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'aneuploidy', 'chromosomal instability', 'hyperdiploidy', 'sister chromatid cohesion']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:36'],"['2020/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:36 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22933 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2021 Jun;60(6):410-417. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22933.

Although age, performance status, and comorbidities are commonly employed to determine fitness for intensive treatment, several studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with treatment in older and classically unfit patients, highlighting the importance of other disease-related and patient-related factors that have prognostic value for treatment outcome in AML. However, consistent and objective assessments for fitness are lacking. Multi-parameter geriatric assessment tools offer more comprehensive evaluation, but are limited by the required resources and lack of standardization and consensus regarding prognostic value. These assessments are particularly important considering the emerging new AML therapies that represent a spectrum of intensities. Patients should therefore be evaluated holistically for fitness to receive a specific treatment, with the aim of providing individualized care, and such definitions of fitness should also consistently be applied to clinical trials. This review will examine evolving criteria for the determination of fitness among AML patients and discuss treatment options for older and/or unfit patients with AML.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Mehta, Priyanka']","['Cortes JE', 'Mehta P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8636-1071'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210112,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:29'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:29 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26079 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Apr 1;96(4):493-507. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26079.

In the present investigation, we sought to determine the relevance of SMAD7 in liver carcinogenesis using in vitro and in vivo approaches. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We found that SMAD7 is up-regulated in a subset of human HCC samples with poor prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that SMAD7 expression correlates with activated yes-associated protein (YAP)/NOTCH pathway and cholangiocellular signature genes in HCCs. These findings were substantiated in human HCC cell lines. In vivo, overexpression of Smad7 alone was unable to initiate HCC development, but it significantly accelerated c-Myc/myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1)-induced mouse HCC formation. Consistent with human HCC data, c-Myc/MCL1/Smad7 liver tumors exhibited an increased cholangiocellular gene expression along with Yap/Notch activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Intriguingly, blocking of the Notch signaling did not affect c-Myc/MCL1/Smad7-induced hepatocarcinogenesis while preventing cholangiocellular signature expression and EMT, whereas ablation of Yap abolished c-Myc/MCL1/Smad7-driven HCC formation. In mice overexpressing a myristoylated/activated form of AKT, coexpression of SMAD7 accelerated carcinogenesis and switched the phenotype from HCC to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) lesions. In human iCCA, SMAD7 expression was robustly up-regulated, especially in the most aggressive tumors, and directly correlated with the levels of YAP/NOTCH targets as well as cholangiocellular and EMT markers. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that SMAD7 contributes to liver carcinogenesis by activating the YAP/NOTCH signaling cascade and inducing a cholangiocellular and EMT signature.","['Wang, Haichuan', 'Song, Xinhua', 'Liao, Haotian', 'Wang, Pan', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Che, Li', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Cigliano, Antonio', 'Ament, Cindy', 'Superville, Daphne', 'Ribback, Silvia', 'Reeves, Melissa', 'Pes, Giovanni M', 'Liang, Binyong', 'Wu, Hong', 'Evert, Matthias', 'Calvisi, Diego F', 'Zeng, Yong', 'Chen, Xin']","['Wang H', 'Song X', 'Liao H', 'Wang P', 'Zhang Y', 'Che L', 'Zhang J', 'Zhou Y', 'Cigliano A', 'Ament C', 'Superville D', 'Ribback S', 'Reeves M', 'Pes GM', 'Liang B', 'Wu H', 'Evert M', 'Calvisi DF', 'Zeng Y', 'Chen X']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6886-5698', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9588-0164']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210615,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:27'],"['2020/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:27 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.31692 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2021 Jul;74(1):248-263. doi: 10.1002/hep.31692.

However, the window period (WP) for serologic or molecular screening is unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Results for anti-HTLV-1 screening and confirmatory tests obtained from 648 591 repeated blood donors in the Kyushu district, one of the most endemic areas of HTLV-1 in the world, were evaluated. A lookback study was conducted for seroconverters. RESULTS: During 2012 to 2019, 436 seroconverters (155 men, 281women) were identified with use of a screening chemiluminescence enzyme-immunoassay (CLEIA) and multiple confirmatory tests. Because the period between the latest seronegative donation and seroconversion was highly variable (2.1-276.7 months), 19 cases that seroconverted within 6 months were subjected to the analysis. The WP of the particle agglutination assay and CLEIA was estimated to be 2.2 +/- 0.6 and 2.6 +/- 1.7 months, respectively. The WP of the indirect immunofluorescence assay was 4.8 +/- 6.5 months. Although the WP of western blotting was estimated to be 6.3 +/- 8.7 months, four cases were still indeterminate through the study period. Chemiluminescence and line immunoassays, the current screening and confirmatory tests used in the Japanese blood program, showed the shortest WP of 2.2 +/- 0.6 months. The WP of real-time polymerase chain reaction for HTLV-1 was estimated to be 4.1 +/- 7.8 months. CONCLUSIONS: The WP in commercially available testing systems for HTLV-1/2 was determined for natural infection among repeated blood donors. Considering the HTLV-1 WP will help increase transfusion safety and facilitate the accurate diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection.","['Sagara, Yasuko', 'Nakamura, Hitomi', 'Yamamoto, Midori', 'Ezaki, Toshinobu', 'Koga, Tomohide', 'Shimamura, Masuhiro', 'Satake, Masahiro', 'Irita, Kazuo']","['Sagara Y', 'Nakamura H', 'Yamamoto M', 'Ezaki T', 'Koga T', 'Shimamura M', 'Satake M', 'Irita K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6322-7195', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5225-7295', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4660-6839']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201224,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1/2 tests', '*blood donors', '*seroconverter', '*window period']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:26'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:26 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.16213 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2021 Feb;61(2):484-493. doi: 10.1111/trf.16213.

We conducted a multicentre retrospective study of 107 patients receiving DM for RRMM. The cohort included 64 trial-unfit patients whose characteristics could not meet inclusion criteria in two previous clinical trials (GEN501 and SIRIUS). The overall response rate (ORR), and median first and second progression-free survival (PFS1 and PFS2) and overall survival were 42.1%, and 3.6, 8.1 and 11.9 months, respectively. Refractoriness to carfilzomib and/or lenalidomide, and neutropenia (<1.0 x 10(9) /l) resulted in poorer ORRs. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of >/=3, neutropenia (<1.0 x 10(9) /l), thrombocytopenia (<75 x 10(9) /l), and renal failure (glomerular filtration rate of <20 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ) were associated with poor PFS1 and PFS2 in respective univariate analysis. The modified trial-unfit group, based on the above factors, showed significantly negative impacts on PFS1 and PFS2 (hazard ratio 2.823 and 3.677, all P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis despite having a 34% ORR. Fatal infections occurred more often in the modified trial-unfit group than in the others (16.1% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.099). Despite failure of DM, subsequent therapy with pomalidomide-based therapy or carfilzomib-dexamethasone provided a 66.6% ORR.

However, the spectrum and consequences of acquired changes in paediatric patients have not been fully evaluated, and especially not in the context of an underlying syndrome. We incorporated a targeted next-generation-sequencing panel of 54 genes for the detection of somatic mutations in paediatric and young adult patients with inherited or acquired cytopenias. Sixty-five patients were included in this study, of whom 17 (26%) had somatic mutations. We detected somatic mutations in 20% of individuals with inherited MDS-predisposition syndromes, including in patients with severe congenital neutropenia and Fanconi anaemia, and with germline mutations in SAMD9L. Thirty-eight per cent of children with acquired cytopenias and suspected MDS had somatic changes, most commonly in genes related to signal transduction and transcription. Molecularly abnormal clones often preceded cytogenetic changes. Thus, routine performance of somatic panels can establish the diagnosis of MDS and determine the optimal timing of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prior to the development of leukaemia. In addition, performing somatic panels in patients with inherited MDS-predisposition syndromes may reveal their unique spectrum of acquired mutations.","['Noy-Lotan, Sharon', 'Krasnov, Tanya', 'Dgany, Orly', 'Jeison, Marta', 'Yanir, Asaf D', 'Gilad, Oded', 'Toledano, Helen', 'Barzilai-Birenboim, Shlomit', 'Yacobovich, Joanne', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Tamary, Hannah', 'Steinberg-Shemer, Orna']","['Noy-Lotan S', 'Krasnov T', 'Dgany O', 'Jeison M', 'Yanir AD', 'Gilad O', 'Toledano H', 'Barzilai-Birenboim S', 'Yacobovich J', 'Izraeli S', 'Tamary H', 'Steinberg-Shemer O']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3994-0556', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3763-5694', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1680-2388']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201227,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*bone marrow failure', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*next generation sequencing', '*paediatric']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:22'],"['2020/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:22 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17285 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 May;193(3):570-580. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17285.

In clinical practice, TKI dose reduction occurs frequently, often on multiple occasions, because of intolerance. We conducted a retrospective 'real-world practice' review of 246 patients receiving lower than standard dose (LD) TKI after the achievement of major molecular response (MR3), because of intolerable adverse events. In 274 of 298 cases of dose reduction (91.9%), MR3 was maintained at median follow-up of 27.3 months. One patient progressed to blast crisis while on LD TKI. Two patients developed two new ABL kinase domain mutations (T315I and V299L), of whom one had achieved deep molecular response on an alternative LD TKI at last follow-up. Seventy-six patients eventually discontinued LD TKI and the two-year treatment-free remission (TFR) rate in these patients was 74.1%. The majority of patients with CML in at least MR3 appear to be safely managed with LD TKI, although three of 246 patients had new events (progression and new mutation), indicating that this approach requires vigilance. TKI LD does not prevent the achievement of TFR in this patient population.","['Claudiani, Simone', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Khan, Afzal', 'Nesr, George', 'Hayden, Chloe', 'J Innes, Andrew', 'Dominy, Kathy', 'Foskett, Pierre', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Khorashad, Jamshid', 'Milojkovic, Dragana']","['Claudiani S', 'Apperley JF', 'Szydlo R', 'Khan A', 'Nesr G', 'Hayden C', 'J Innes A', 'Dominy K', 'Foskett P', 'Foroni L', 'Khorashad J', 'Milojkovic D']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3686-7610', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7147-843X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0918-8882', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6961-7311']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201224,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*TFR', '*TKI', '*dose-reduction', '*low dose']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:22'],"['2020/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:22 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17286 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Apr;193(2):346-355. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17286.

However, there is limited information regarding antibiotic resistance, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of PA BSI in AL patients. This study explored characteristics associated with the clinical outcomes of AL patients with PA BSI and analyzed factors associated with BSI caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) or carbapenem-resistant strains. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study enrolled hospitalized AL patients who developed PA BSI during January 2014-December 2019. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Of 293 eligible patients with PA BSI, 55 (18.8%) received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy within 48 hours of BSI onset, whereas up to 65.8% MDR-PA BSI patients received inappropriate empirical treatment. The 30-day mortality rate was 8.5% for all patients. However, the 30-day mortality rates were 28.9% and 5.5% in MDR-PA BSI and non-MDR-PA BSI patients, respectively (P < .001). On multivariate analysis, previous use of quinolones (odds ratio [OR], 5.851 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.638-12.975]) and piperacillin/tazobactam (OR, 2.837 [95% CI, 1.151-6.994]) were independently associated with MDR-PA BSI; and MDR-PA BSI (OR, 7.196 [95% CI, 2.773-18.668]), perianal infection (OR, 4.079 [95% CI, 1.401-11.879]), pulmonary infection (OR, 3.028 [95% CI, 1.231-7.446]), and age >/=55 years (OR, 2.871 [95% CI, 1.057-7.799]) were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: MDR increases mortality risk in PA BSI patients, and previous antibiotic exposure is important in MDR-PA BSI development. Rational antibiotic use based on local antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical characteristics can help reduce antibiotic resistance and mortality.","['Zhao, Yuanqi', 'Lin, Qingsong', 'Liu, Li', 'Ma, Runzhi', 'Chen, Juan', 'Shen, Yuyan', 'Zhu, Guoqing', 'Jiang, Erlie', 'Mi, Yingchang', 'Han, Mingzhe', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Feng, Sizhou']","['Zhao Y', 'Lin Q', 'Liu L', 'Ma R', 'Chen J', 'Shen Y', 'Zhu G', 'Jiang E', 'Mi Y', 'Han M', 'Wang J', 'Feng S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['* Pseudomonas aeruginosa', '*bloodstream infection', '*multidrug-resistant', '*outcome', '*treatment']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:15'],"['2020/12/28 12:15 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['6046206 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciaa1522 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Dec 23;71(Suppl 4):S386-S393. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa1522.,20210427,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

METHODS: The workshop panel reviewed 109 cases, assigned consensus diagnosis, and created diagnosis-specific sessions. RESULTS: The most frequent diagnosis was reactive eosinophilia (35), followed by acute leukemia (24). Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) received 17 submissions, including chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS). Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), MDS/MPN, and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms received 11, while GDE and HES received 12 and 11 submissions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hypereosinophilia and HES are defined by specific clinical and laboratory criteria. Eosinophilia is commonly reactive. An acute leukemic onset with eosinophilia may suggest core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia, blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia, or t(5;14) B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Eosinophilia is rare in MDS but common in MDS/MPN. CEL, NOS is a clinically aggressive MPN with eosinophilia as the dominant feature. Bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic and/or molecular clonality may distinguish CEL from HES.

We determined NPM1mut transcript levels (TLs) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and evaluated the prognostic impact of NPM1mut MRD and the effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) on NPM1mut TLs and the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients with NPM1mut AML enrolled in the randomized phase 3 AMLSG 09-09 trial. A total of 3733 bone marrow (BM) samples and 3793 peripheral blood (PB) samples from 469 patients were analyzed. NPM1mut TL log10 reduction >/= 3 and achievement of MRD negativity in BM and PB were significantly associated with a lower CIR rate, after 2 treatment cycles and at end of treatment (EOT). In multivariate analyses, MRD positivity was consistently revealed to be a poor prognostic factor in BM and PB. With regard to treatment effect, the median NPM1mut TLs were significantly lower in the GO-Arm across all treatment cycles, resulting in a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving MRD negativity at EOT (56% vs 41%; P = .01). The better reduction in NPM1mut TLs after 2 treatment cycles in MRD positive patients by the addition of GO led to a significantly lower CIR rate (4-year CIR, 29.3% vs 45.7%, P = .009). In conclusion, the addition of GO to intensive chemotherapy in NPM1mut AML resulted in a significantly better reduction in NPM1mut TLs across all treatment cycles, leading to a significantly lower relapse rate.","['Kapp-Schwoerer, Silke', 'Weber, Daniela', 'Corbacioglu, Andrea', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Kronke, Jan', 'Theis, Frauke', 'Rucker, Frank G', 'Teleanu, Maria-Veronica', 'Panina, Ekaterina', 'Jahn, Nikolaus', 'Herzig, Julia', 'Kubanek, Lena', 'Schrade, Anika', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Schroeder, Thomas', 'Mayer, Karin T', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Wattad, Mohammed', 'Gotze, Katharina S', 'Horst, Heinz A', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'Wulf, Gerald', 'Schleicher, Jan', 'Bentz, Martin', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Krzykalla, Julia', 'Benner, Axel', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Kapp-Schwoerer S', 'Weber D', 'Corbacioglu A', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Paschka P', 'Kronke J', 'Theis F', 'Rucker FG', 'Teleanu MV', 'Panina E', 'Jahn N', 'Herzig J', 'Kubanek L', 'Schrade A', 'Gohring G', 'Fiedler W', 'Kindler T', 'Schroeder T', 'Mayer KT', 'Lubbert M', 'Wattad M', 'Gotze KS', 'Horst HA', 'Koller E', 'Wulf G', 'Schleicher J', 'Bentz M', 'Krauter J', 'Bullinger L', 'Krzykalla J', 'Benner A', 'Schlenk RF', 'Thol F', 'Heuser M', 'Ganser A', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:15'],"['2020/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 12:15 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)83906-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020005998 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Dec 24;136(26):3041-3050. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020005998.,20210405,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pneumology, University Cancer Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Kliniken Essen Sud, Essen, Germany.', 'III.

METHODS: The cases were summarized according to their respective gene rearrangement to illustrate the spectrum of clinical, laboratory, and histopathology manifestations and to explore the appropriate molecular genetic tests. RESULTS: Disease presentations were heterogeneous, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), MDS/MPN, acute myeloid leukemia, acute B- or T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL/LBL), or mixed-lineage neoplasms. Frequent extramedullary involvement occurred. Eosinophilia was common but not invariably present. With the advancement of RNA sequencing, cryptic rearrangements were recognized in genes other than PDGFRA. Additional somatic mutations were more frequent in the FGFR1-rearranged cases. Cases with B-ALL presentations differed from Philadelphia-like B-ALL by the presence of an underlying MPN. Cases with FLT3 and ABL1 rearrangements could be potential candidates for future inclusion in this category. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate diagnosis and classification of this category of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms has important therapeutic implications. With the large number of submitted cases, we expand our understanding of these rare neoplasms and improve our ability to diagnose these genetically defined disorders.","['Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Kelemen, Katalin', 'King, Rebecca', 'Reichard, Kaaren K', 'Craig, Fiona E', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Rimsza, Lisa', 'George, Tracy I', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Pozdnyakova O', 'Orazi A', 'Kelemen K', 'King R', 'Reichard KK', 'Craig FE', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Rimsza L', 'George TI', 'Horny HP', 'Wang SA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['* FGFR1', '* PCM1-JAK2', '* PDGFRA', '* PDGFRB', '*2019 Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology', 'Workshop', '*Eosinophilia', '*Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/03/27 06:00,['2020/12/28 12:14'],"['2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 12:14 [entrez]']","['6046533 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqaa208 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2021 Feb 4;155(2):160-178. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqaa208.,20210326,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Therefore, in this study the relationship between the lncRNA SNHG1 -miR183-5p-FOXO1 axis and AML was explored. Methods: Expression of lncRNA SNHG16 and miR183-5p was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR, and the level of FOXO1 and other proteins was measured by Western blot. Expression vectors of lncRNA SNHG16, miR183-5p, and FOXO1 were constructed to assess effects of the three on cell proliferation and apoptosis. MTT reduction assays were employed for cell proliferation, flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis, and dual luciferase-reporter assays for the targeting relationship between lncRNA SNHG16 and miR183-5p and miR183-5p and FOXO1. Results: lncRNA SNHG16 was highly expressed in peripheral blood/leukemia cell lines of patients with AML compared with normal human peripheral blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells. miR183-5p was the target of lncRNA SNHG16 and FOXO1 the target gene of miR183-5p rather than lncRNA SNHG16. Absence of lncRNA SNHG16 led to upregulation of miR183-5p, promotion of apoptosis, and inhibition of proliferation. Suppression of miR183-5p accelerated cell proliferation and hindered apoptosis. miR183-5p negatively regulated FOXO1, and FOXO1 promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis.

These aberrations are frequently present in early thymic progenitor-ALL patients and relate to steroid resistance. Functional modeling of NR3C1 aberrations in pre-B ALL and T-cell ALL cell lines demonstrate that aberrations decreasing NR3C1 expression are important contributors to steroid resistance at disease diagnosis.

The authors report the first known adult case of inadvertently administered daunomycin directly into the human central nervous system and the neurologic manifestations and therapeutic interventions that followed. Clinical description: A 53-year-old male presenting to the hospital for his second cycle of consolidation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia t(15;17) was accidentally administered 93 mg of intrathecal (IT) daunomycin. Within several hours of injection, the patient subsequently developed bilateral lower extremity pain, ascending paresthesias, headache, and left cranial nerve (CN) III palsy. Immediately following these neurologic sequalae, a subarachnoid lumbar drain was placed at the L4-5 interspace for the initial irrigation and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By hospital day 2, the patient's mental status significantly declined requiring an external ventricular drain (EVD) for hydrocephalus. Despite therapeutic interventions, the patient developed an ascending radiculomyeloencephalopathy with deterioration in clinical status. Eighteen days after the inadvertent injection of IT daunomycin, the patient became comatose and lost all cranial nerve function. Conclusions: Accidental IT injection of daunomycin is a neurosurgical emergency and warrants prompt intervention. Symptoms can mimic other medical conditions, making it imperative an accurate diagnosis is made so that appropriate therapies are implemented. At this time, therapies include rapid removal of the chemotherapeutic agent from the IT compartment by aspiration and irrigation; however, it is unclear if neuroprotective agents may provide added benefit.","['Soldozy, Sauson', 'Patel, Anant', 'Yaeger, Kurt', 'Felbaum, Daniel', 'Spitz, Steven M', 'Syed, Hasan R', 'Nair, M Nathan']","['Soldozy S', 'Patel A', 'Yaeger K', 'Felbaum D', 'Spitz SM', 'Syed HR', 'Nair MN']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201128,Netherlands,eNeurologicalSci,eNeurologicalSci,101667077,,['NOTNLM'],"['Daunomycin', 'External ventricular drain', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Intrathecal injection', 'Lumbar drain', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Paraplegia']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:01,['2020/12/28 12:03'],"['2020/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 12:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ensci.2020.100297 [doi]', 'S2405-6502(20)30076-9 [pii]']",epublish,eNeurologicalSci. 2020 Nov 28;22:100297. doi: 10.1016/j.ensci.2020.100297. eCollection 2021 Mar.,,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],"['Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Mount Sinai Health System, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.']",,,,,,PMC7750546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main transmission methods are unprotected sexual intercourse, vertical transmission and breastfeeding and direct exposure to infected blood or tissue. The identification of infected mothers prior to delivery is a highly important step in preventing mother to child transmission. Universal antenatal screening for HTLV is not recommended in Romania, although there are sufficient data demonstrating the risk of vertical transmission. We present the case of an HTLV-1-infected pregnant woman, with an aim to highlight: i) points of strategy for the management of HTLV during pregnancy; ii) the particularities of the course of pregnancy; and iii) the aspects that show the importance of knowing the status regarding the HTLV infection antepartum. The case was particular due to the ascendant proviral load during the pregnancy period, which led to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and the particular pregnancy outcome with preterm rupture of membranes and fetal growth restriction. According to current recommendations, pregnant women infected with HTLV-1 should be advised to refrain from donating blood, body organs, or other tissues. There is no evidence of the number of individuals infected with this virus in Romania at present, and the diagnosis can only occur by chance. A specific treatment or immunization for HTLV infection does not currently exist, thus preventive methods are the only tool to reduce the prevalence and mortality of this infection.","['Bohiltea, Roxana Elena', 'Turcan, Natalia', 'Berceanu, Costin', 'Munteanu, Octavian', 'Georgescu, Tiberiu Augustin', 'Ducu, Ionita', 'Neacsu, Adrian', 'Furtunescu, Florentina']","['Bohiltea RE', 'Turcan N', 'Berceanu C', 'Munteanu O', 'Georgescu TA', 'Ducu I', 'Neacsu A', 'Furtunescu F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201126,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,['NOTNLM'],"['PROM', 'breastfeeding', 'fetal growth restriction', 'human T-lymphotropic virus', 'pregnancy', 'stem cell storage']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:01,['2020/12/28 12:00'],"['2020/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 12:00 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2020.9514 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-09514 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2021 Jan;21(1):82. doi: 10.3892/etm.2020.9514.

These alterations in the leukemic blasts promote clinically diverse manifestations with common characteristics of high relapse and drug resistance. Defining and real-time monitoring of a personalized panel of these predictive genetic biomarkers is rapidly being adapted in clinical setting for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision-making in AML. A major challenge remains the frequency of invasive biopsy procedures that can be routinely performed for monitoring of AML disease progression. Moreover, a single-site biopsy is not representative of the tumor heterogeneity as it is spatially and temporally constrained and necessitates the understanding of longitudinal and spatial subclonal dynamics in AML. Hematopoietic cells are a major contributor to plasma cell-free DNA, which also contain leukemia-specific aberrations as the circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) fraction. Plasma cell-free DNA analysis holds immense potential as a minimally invasive tool for genomic profiling at diagnosis as well as clonal evolution during AML disease progression. With the technological advances and increasing sensitivity for detection of ctDNA, both genetic and epigenetic aberrations can be qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. However, challenges remain in validating the utility of liquid biopsy tools in clinics, and universal recommendations are still awaited towards reliable diagnostics and prognostics. Here, we provide an overview on the scope of ctDNA analyses for prognosis, assessment of response to treatment and measurable residual disease, prediction of disease relapse, development of acquired resistance and beyond in AML.","['Thakral, Deepshi', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar', 'Verma, Pramod', 'Kumar, Indresh', 'Vashishtha, Sangeeta']","['Thakral D', 'Gupta R', 'Sahoo RK', 'Verma P', 'Kumar I', 'Vashishtha S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201211,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cfDNA', 'circulating tumor DNA', 'ctDNA', 'genomic profiling', 'hematological malignancies', 'measurable residual disease', 'plasma cell free DNA']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:01,['2020/12/28 11:58'],"['2020/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 11:58 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.604391 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Dec 11;8:604391. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.604391. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Thakral, Gupta, Sahoo, Verma, Kumar and Vashishtha.']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. BRA IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7759522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted this study to comprehensively analyze the temporal trends of leukemia mortality during 2003-2017 and project the trends until 2030. We extracted national-level data on annual leukemia mortality from China Health Statistics Yearbooks (2003-2017). We applied the Joinpoint regression model to assess leukemia mortality trends in urban and rural China by sex during 2003-2017. We also produced sex-specific leukemia mortality using the adjusted Global Burden Disease (GBD) 2016 projection model. In urban areas, age-standardized leukemia mortality decreased significantly among females during 2003-2017 (APC = -0.9%; 95% CI: -1.7, -0.1%). In rural areas, significant decreases of age-standardized leukemia mortality were both found among males (APC = -1.7%; 95% CI: -2.9, -0.5%) and females (APC = -1.6%; 95% CI: -2.6, -0.7%) from 2008 to 2017. Rural-urban and sex disparities of leukemia mortality will continue to exist until the year 2030. According to projection, the leukemia mortality rates of males and rural populations are higher than that of females and urban populations. In 2030, leukemia mortality is projected to decrease to 3.03/100,000 and 3.33/100,000 among the males in urban and rural areas, respectively. In females, leukemia mortality will decrease to 1.87/100,000 and 2.26/100,000 among urban and rural areas, respectively. Our study suggests that more precautionary measures to reduce leukemia mortality are need, and more attention should be paid to rural residents and males in primary prevention of leukemia in China.","['Li, Baojing', 'Tang, Hong', 'Cheng, Zilu', 'Zhang, Yuxiao', 'Xiang, Hao']","['Li B', 'Tang H', 'Cheng Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Xiang H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201211,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*SDGs', '*joinpoint analysis', '*leukemia', '*mortality', '*projection']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:57'],"['2020/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 11:57 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2020.598215 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2020 Dec 11;8:598215. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2020.598215. eCollection 2020.,20210514,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Li, Tang, Cheng, Zhang and Xiang.']","['Department of Global Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Global Health Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Global Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Global Health Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Global Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Global Health Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Global Health, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Global Health Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",,"['China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Male', '*Neoplasms', 'Rural Population', 'Urban Population']","['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7759534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its activation is also critical for the genesis of many lymphoma types. BCR-mediated lymphoma proliferation may be caused by activating BCR-pathway mutations and/or by active or tonic stimulation of the BCR. BCRs of lymphomas have frequently been described as polyreactive. In this review, the role of specific target antigens of the BCRs of lymphomas is highlighted. These antigens have been found to be restricted to specific lymphoma entities. The antigens can be of infectious origin, such as H. pylori in gastric MALT lymphoma or RpoC of M. catarrhalis in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, or they are autoantigens. Examples of such autoantigens are the BCR itself in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, LRPAP1 in mantle cell lymphoma, hyper-N-glycosylated SAMD14/neurabin-I in primary central nervous system lymphoma, hypo-phosphorylated ARS2 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and hyper-phosphorylated SLP2, sumoylated HSP90 or saposin C in plasma cell dyscrasia. Notably, atypical posttranslational modifications are often responsible for the immunogenicity of many autoantigens.

Although the overall survival (OS) has been improved in recent years, the mechanisms of AML remain largely unknown. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore the differentially methylated genes and to investigate the underlying mechanism in AML initiation and progression based on the bioinformatic analysis. Methods: Methylation array data and gene expression data were obtained from TARGET Data Matrix. The consensus clustering analysis was performed using ConsensusClusterPlus R package. The global DNA methylation was analyzed using methylationArrayAnalysis R package and differentially methylated genes (DMGs), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Limma R package. Besides, the biological function was analyzed using clusterProfiler R package. The correlation between DMGs and DEGs was determined using psych R package. Moreover, the correlation between DMGs and AML was assessed using varElect online tool. And the overall survival and progression-free survival were analyzed using survival R package. Results: All AML samples in this study were divided into three clusters at k = 3. Based on consensus clustering, we identified 1,146 CpGs, including 40 hypermethylated and 1,106 hypomethylated CpGs in AML. Besides, a total 529 DEGs were identified, including 270 upregulated and 259 downregulated DEGs in AML. The function analysis showed that DEGs significantly enriched in AML related biological process. Moreover, the correlation between DMGs and DEGs indicated that seven DMGs directly interacted with AML. CD34, HOXA7, and CD96 showed the strongest correlation with AML. Further, we explored three CpG sites cg03583857, cg26511321, cg04039397 of CD34, HOXA7, and CD96 which acted as the clinical prognostic biomarkers. Conclusion: Our study identified three novel methylated genes in AML and also explored the mechanism of methylated genes in AML. Our finding may provide novel potential prognostic markers for AML.","['Zheng, Jiafeng', 'Zhang, Tongqiang', 'Guo, Wei', 'Zhou, Caili', 'Cui, Xiaojian', 'Gao, Long', 'Cai, Chunquan', 'Xu, Yongsheng']","['Zheng J', 'Zhang T', 'Guo W', 'Zhou C', 'Cui X', 'Gao L', 'Cai C', 'Xu Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia', 'children', 'methylation', 'multi-omics', 'prognostic']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:01,['2020/12/28 11:57'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 11:57 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.591937 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 10;10:591937. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.591937. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zheng, Zhang, Guo, Zhou, Cui, Gao, Cai and Xu.']","[""Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Science and Education, Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Clinical Lab, Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China."", ""Tianjin Institute of Pediatrics (Tianjin Key Laboratory of Birth Defects for Prevention and Treatment), Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, Tianjin Children's Hospital (Tianjin University Children's Hospital), Tianjin, China.""]",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7758482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed apparent marrow expansion of megakaryocytes in three out of six patients with Flt3-mutated AML following treatment with a recently FDA-approved Flt3 inhibitor, gilteritinib which possesses activity against internal tandem duplication and tyrosine kinase domain Flt3 mutations and also inhibits tyrosine kinase AXL. To assess whether biopsy findings can be attributed to promotion of megakaryocytic (Mk) differentiation with gilteritinib, we devised a cellular assay by overexpressing double mutated Flt3-ITD(Y591F/Y919F) in chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 to study Mk differentiation in the presence of Flt3 and AXL inhibitors with non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. These experiments demonstrated the lack of direct effect Flt3 inhibitors gilteritinib and quizartinib on megakaryocytic differentiation at either transcriptional or phenotypic levels, and highlighted antileukemic effects of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor and its potential role in megakaryocytic development.","['Suknuntha, Kran', 'Choi, Yoon Jung', 'Jung, Ho Sun', 'Majumder, Aditi', 'Shah, Sujal', 'Slukvin, Igor', 'Ranheim, Erik A']","['Suknuntha K', 'Choi YJ', 'Jung HS', 'Majumder A', 'Shah S', 'Slukvin I', 'Ranheim EA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-acute myeloid leukemia', 'AXL', 'Flt3', 'gilteritinib (Xospata)', 'internal tandem duplication (ITD)', 'megakaryocyte', 'midostaurin']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:01,['2020/12/28 11:57'],"['2020/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 11:57 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.585151 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 9;10:585151. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.585151. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Suknuntha, Choi, Jung, Majumder, Shah, Slukvin and Ranheim.']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Samut Prakan, Thailand.', 'Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,['P51 OD011106/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7756118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the classical methods treat the treatment response as homogeneous and estimate the average treatment effects. The traditional methods are difficult to apply to precision oncology. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool for precision oncology. It can accurately estimate the individualized treatment effects and learn optimal treatment choices. Therefore, the AI approach can substantially improve progress and treatment outcomes of patients. One AI approach, conditional generative adversarial nets for inference of individualized treatment effects (GANITE) has been developed. However, GANITE can only deal with binary treatment and does not provide a tool for optimal treatment selection. To overcome these limitations, we modify conditional generative adversarial networks (MCGANs) to allow estimation of individualized effects of any types of treatments including binary, categorical and continuous treatments. We propose to use sparse techniques for selection of biomarkers that predict the best treatment for each patient. Simulations show that MCGANs outperform seven other state-of-the-art methods: linear regression (LR), Bayesian linear ridge regression (BLR), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), random forest classification [RF (C)], random forest regression [RF (R)], logistic regression (LogR), and support vector machine (SVM). To illustrate their applications, the proposed MCGANs were applied to 256 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were treated with high dose ara-C (HDAC), Idarubicin (IDA) and both of these two treatments (HDAC+IDA) at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Our results showed that MCGAN can more accurately and robustly estimate the individualized treatment effects than other state-of-the art methods. Several biomarkers such as GSK3, BILIRUBIN, SMAC are identified and a total of 30 biomarkers can explain 36.8% of treatment effect variation.","['Ge, Qiyang', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Fang, Shenying', 'Guo, Shicheng', 'Liu, Yuanyuan', 'Lin, Wei', 'Xiong, Momiao']","['Ge Q', 'Huang X', 'Fang S', 'Guo S', 'Liu Y', 'Lin W', 'Xiong M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201211,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['causal inference', 'counterfactuals', 'generative adversarial networks', 'precision medicine', 'treatment estimation']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:01,['2020/12/28 11:56'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 11:56 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.585804 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Dec 11;11:585804. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.585804. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Ge, Huang, Fang, Guo, Liu, Lin and Xiong.']","['Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, United States.', 'School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, United States.', 'School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, United States.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

A potentially combinatorial therapeutic strategy may be the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, overexpressed in most cancer cells. In this study we investigated the combination of 3rd-generation CD19.CAR-T cells and the BH3 mimetics venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, or S63845, a Mcl-1 inhibitor, under three different treatment conditions: pre-sensitization of cancer cells with BH3 mimetics followed by CAR-T cell treatment, simultaneous combination therapy, and the administration of BH3 mimetics after CAR-T cell treatment. Our results showed that administration of CAR-T cells and BH3 mimetics had a significant effect on the quantity and quality of CD19.CAR-T cells. The administration of BH3 mimetics prior to CAR-T cell therapy exerted an enhanced cytotoxic efficacy by upregulating the CD19 expression and pro-apoptotic proteins in highly sensitive tumor cells, and thereby improving both CD19.CAR-T cell cytotoxicity and persistence. In simultaneous and post-treatment approaches, however, the quantity of CAR-T cells was adversely affected.

Quercetin (Qu), one kind of flavonoid, exhibits anti-cancer property in multiple types of solid tumor, but its effect on acute myeloid leukemia is less studied, and the underlying mechanisms still largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the specific target and potential mechanism of quercetin-induced cell death in AML. First, we found that quercetin induces cell death in the form of apoptosis, which was caspase dependent. Second, we found that quercetin-induced apoptosis depends on the decrease of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) and Bcl-2 proteins. With quantitative chemical proteomics, we observed the downregulation of VEGFR2 and PI3K/Akt signaling in quercetin-treated cells. Consistently, cell studies also identified that VEGFR2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are involved in the action of quercetin on mitochondria and Bcl-2 proteins. The decrease of MMP and cell death could be rescued when PI3K/Akt signaling is activated, suggesting that VEGFR2 and PI3K/Akt exert as upstream regulators for quercetin effect on apoptosis induction in AML cells. In conclusion, our findings from this study provide convincing evidence that quercetin induces cell death via downregulation of VEGF/Akt signaling pathways and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in AML cells.","['Shi, Huan', 'Li, Xin-Yu', 'Chen, Yao', 'Zhang, Xing', 'Wu, Yong', 'Wang, Zi-Xuan', 'Chen, Pan-Hong', 'Dai, Hui-Qi', 'Feng, Ji', 'Chatterjee, Sayantan', 'Li, Zhong-Jie', 'Huang, Xiao-Wei', 'Wei, Hong-Qiao', 'Wang, Jigang', 'Lu, Guo-Dong', 'Zhou, Jing']","['Shi H', 'Li XY', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang X', 'Wu Y', 'Wang ZX', 'Chen PH', 'Dai HQ', 'Feng J', 'Chatterjee S', 'Li ZJ', 'Huang XW', 'Wei HQ', 'Wang J', 'Lu GD', 'Zhou J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'mitochondria', 'quercetin', 'vascular endothelial growth factor/PI3K/Akt']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:01,['2020/12/28 11:55'],"['2020/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/28 11:55 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2020.534171 [doi]', '534171 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Dec 10;11:534171. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.534171. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Shi, Li, Chen, Zhang, Wu, Wang, Chen, Dai, Feng, Chatterjee,', 'Li, Huang, Wei, Wang, Lu and Zhou.']","['Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Hunan University of Medicine, Huaihua, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Artemisinin Research Center and the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Artemisinin Research Center and the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Key Laboratory of High-incidence-Tumor Prevention and Treatment (Guangxi Medical University), Ministry of Education of China, Nanning, China.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Preclinical Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7758733,,,,,,,['Front Pharmacol. 2021 Feb 08;11:640750.

The HTLV-1 Tax protein persistently activates the NF-kappaB pathway to enhance the proliferation and survival of HTLV-1 infected T cells. Lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of Tax provides an important regulatory mechanism that promotes Tax-mediated interaction with the IKK complex and activation of NF-kappaB; however, the host proteins regulating Tax ubiquitination are largely unknown. To identify new Tax interacting proteins that may regulate its ubiquitination we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using Tax as bait. This screen yielded the E3/E4 ubiquitin conjugation factor UBE4B as a novel binding partner for Tax. Here, we confirmed the interaction between Tax and UBE4B in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation assays and demonstrated colocalization by proximity ligation assay and confocal microscopy. Overexpression of UBE4B specifically enhanced Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation, whereas knockdown of UBE4B impaired Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation and the induction of NF-kappaB target genes in T cells and ATLL cell lines. Furthermore, depletion of UBE4B with shRNA resulted in apoptotic cell death and diminished the proliferation of ATLL cell lines. Finally, overexpression of UBE4B enhanced Tax polyubiquitination, and knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of UBE4B attenuated both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination of Tax. Collectively, these results implicate UBE4B in HTLV-1 Tax polyubiquitination and downstream NF-kappaB activation.","['Mohanty, Suchitra', 'Han, Teng', 'Choi, Young Bong', 'Lavorgna, Alfonso', 'Zhang, Jiawen', 'Harhaj, Edward William']","['Mohanty S', 'Han T', 'Choi YB', 'Lavorgna A', 'Zhang J', 'Harhaj EW']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2523-1441', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5614-3559', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6129-7341', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1197-6765']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20201223,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/01/30 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:53'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 11:53 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008504 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-20-00582 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2020 Dec 23;16(12):e1008504. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008504. eCollection 2020 Dec.,20210129,,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Penn State College School of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'W.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CML patients (n = 33) exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of the ChNPP accidentwere enrolled. The comparison group consisted of CML patients (n = 725) with no history of radiation exposure. Allpatients were in the chronic phase of the disease. Clinical, hematological and molecular genetic research methodswere applied. RESULTS: Patients exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of the ChNPP accident had no differences in CML manifestation, as well as in classical genetic markers at the onset of the disease compared with patients with no historyof radiation exposure. Reduction of tumor clone on imatinib therapy was significantly less effective in the patientsexposed to ionizing radiation than in cases of no history of radiation exposure. Cases of primary resistance were statistically significantly prevalent in the ChNPP accident consequences clean-up workers while in the residents ofradiologically contaminated areas a statistically significant increase in probability of loss of complete cytogeneticresponse (development of secondary resistance) to imatinib therapy was found. An association was found betweenthe radiation exposure and probability of loss of complete cytogenetic response to imatinib therapy in this group ofpatients. CONCLUSION: The radiation exposure in the history even many years before the onset of CML is an unfavorable exogenous factor responsible for the development of resistance to imatinib therapy.","['Dyagil, I S', 'Dmytrenko, I V', 'Sholoiko, V V', 'Fedorenko, V G', 'Shlyakhtichenko, T Yu', 'Petrusha, O O', 'Martina, Z V', 'Tovstogan, A O', 'Silayev, Yu O', 'Stupakova, Z V', 'Minchenko, Z M']","['Dyagil IS', 'Dmytrenko IV', 'Sholoiko VV', 'Fedorenko VG', 'Shlyakhtichenko TY', 'Petrusha OO', 'Martina ZV', 'Tovstogan AO', 'Silayev YO', 'Stupakova ZV', 'Minchenko ZM']",,"['eng', 'ukr']",['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'ionizing radiation', 'response to treatment', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:52'],"['2020/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 11:52 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.33145/2304-8336-2020-25-443-455 [doi]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2020 Dec;25:443-455. doi: 10.33145/2304-8336-2020-25-443-455.,20211008,"['I.

METHODS: Analysis was performed in the group of 69 CLL patients irradiated due to the Chornobyl NPP accident (58clean-up workers of 1986 year, 6 inhabitants of radionuclide contaminated areas, and 5 evacuees). The IGHV genemutational status was studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing. LPL and c-MYCexpression was evaluated by Quantitative Real-time PCR. Data were analyzed with the SPSS software package, version 20.0. RESULTS: Relative LPL expression levels in CLL samples ranged from 0 to 1663.5 (mean 138.47 +/- 30.69, median 26.1).A strong correlation between individual LPL expression levels and IGHV mutational status was found (r = 0.684;p < 0.0001). The average relative c-MYC expression level was 5.7 +/- 0.87 (median 2.86; range 0-48.5). No association between c-MYC expression and IGHV mutational status was found. Among unmutated IGHV cases, a correlationbetween LPL and c-MYC gene expression levels was identified: r = 0.351; p = 0.013. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the dominant concept that unmutated IGHV CLL cases are more sensitive to the actionof proliferative stimuli compared to mutated IGHV CLL cases. This is manifested by an increase in the expression ofa functionally significant LPL gene, is one for the strongest negative prognostic markers in CLL.","['Bilous, N I', 'Abramenko, I V', 'Chumak, A A', 'Diagil, I S', 'Martina, Z V']","['Bilous NI', 'Abramenko IV', 'Chumak AA', 'Diagil IS', 'Martina ZV']",,"['eng', 'ukr']",['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chornobyl NPP accident', 'IGHV genes', 'LPL', 'c-MYC', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:52'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 11:52 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.33145/2304-8336-2020-25-421-429 [doi]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2020 Dec;25:421-429. doi: 10.33145/2304-8336-2020-25-421-429.,20211008,"['N.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 333 children (295 - ALL, 38 - AML) were examined at the stages of chemotherapy. Thecomparison group included 93 children without leukemia. Acute leukemia variants, patients survival, relapses, thenature of disease (live child or died), iron methabolism (morphometric parameters of erythrocytes, SI, SF, STf, TS),manifestations of dyserythropoiesis, bone marrow sideroblast and patients radiation dose were taken into account. RESULTS: In 295 patients with ALL the following variants of leukemia were established: pro-B-ALL in 23, <<common>>type of ALL in 224, pre-B-ALL in 29, T-ALL in 19. Thirty eight patients were diagnosed with AML (11 - M1, 19 - M2,8 - M4). Doses of radiation in patients with AL were (2.78 +/- 0.10) mSv and they did not correlate with clinical andhematological parameters, disease variant. Relapse rates and shorter survival were in patients with T-ALL, pro-B-ALLand AML with SF levels > 500 ng/ml (p < 0.05). The amount of children with normochromic-normocytic anemias andmanifestations of dysplasia of erythroid lineage elements was greater in the AML than in ALL. SF content in patientswas elevated during chemotherapy and was lower than the initial one only in the remission period. Transferrin wasreliably overloaded with iron: TS (70.2 +/- 2.3) % compared with the control group (32.7 +/- 2.1) %. Correlationbetween TS and survival of patients was detected (rs = -0.45).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Separate and joint cultivation of PBL from healthy persons (cells-bystanders) together withblood cells from CLL patients irradiated in vitro at the G0 stage of the mitotic cycle by gamma-quanta 137Cs in a dose of0.5 Gy 137Cs (cells-inductors) was used. For joint cultivation our own model system for co-cultivation of PBL fromindividuals of different sex, designed by us to investigate the bystander effects at the cytogenetic level was used.Traditional cytogenetic analysis of uniformly painted chromosomes with group karyotyping was performed. The frequency of chromosome aberrations in cells-inductors and cells-bystanders as the markers of chromosome instability were determined. RESULTS: Found that at co-cultivation of PBL from healthy individuals with irradiated blood cells from CLL patientsthe middle group frequency of chromosome aberrations in the bystander cells (5.18 +/- 0.51 per 100 metaphases,p < 0.001) was statistically significant higher than its background level determined at a separate cultivaton (1.52+/- 0.30 per 100 metaphases), and at co-cultivation with non-irradiated blood cells from CLL patients (3.31 +/- 0.50 per100 metaphases, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Co-cultivation of in vitro irradiated blood cells from CLL patients with PBL from healthy persons leadsto an increase in the level of chromosome instability in the bystander cells due to synergism between tumor-inducedand radiation-induced bystander effects.","['Pilinska, M A', 'Shemetun, O V', 'Talan, O A', 'Dibska, O B', 'Kravchenko, S M', 'Sholoiko, V V']","['Pilinska MA', 'Shemetun OV', 'Talan OA', 'Dibska OB', 'Kravchenko SM', 'Sholoiko VV']",,"['eng', 'ukr']",['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol,Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii,101560511,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'chromosomal instability', 'human peripheral blood lymphocytes', 'ionizing radiation', 'tumor-induced bystander effect']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:52'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 11:52 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.33145/2304-8336-2020-25-353-361 [doi]'],ppublish,Probl Radiac Med Radiobiol. 2020 Dec;25:353-361. doi: 10.33145/2304-8336-2020-25-353-361.,20211008,"['M.

CASE REPORT: Here we report a case of a 39-year-old lady, with an incidental finding of hyperleukocytosis (white blood cells count: 139.2 x 109/L). Her peripheral blood film revealed 36% of blasts and a bone marrow aspiration showed 53% of blasts. Immunophenotyping showed a population of blasts exhibiting positivity of two lineages, myeloid lineage and B-lymphoid lineage with strong positivity of CD34 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt). A conventional karyotyping revealed the presence of Philadelphia chromosome. She was diagnosed with MPAL with t(9,22), BCR ABL1, which carried a poor prognosis. She was treated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) chemotherapy protocol coupled with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and was planned for an allogeneic stem cells transplant. CONCLUSION: This MPAL case was diagnosed incidentally in an asymptomatic patient during medical check-up. We highlight this rare case report to raise the awareness about this rare disease. Understanding the pathogenesis of the disease with the underlying genes responsible for triggering the disease, uniform protocols for diagnosis and targeted treatment will help for proper management of these patients.","['Yong, W L', 'Yusof, N', 'Ithnin, A', 'Shuib, S', 'Tumian, R', 'Yousuf, R', 'Abdul Aziz, S']","['Yong WL', 'Yusof N', 'Ithnin A', 'Shuib S', 'Tumian R', 'Yousuf R', 'Abdul Aziz S']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:44'],"['2020/12/28 11:44 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2020 Dec;42(3):469-476.,20211004,,"['Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Diagnostic and Laboratory Services, Jalan Yaacob Latif, Bandar Tun Razak, 56000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. suria.abdulaziz@gmail.com.']","['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate (IM), a BCR-ABL1 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug, is the first line gold standard drug for CML treatment. Conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) can identify the standard and variant Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, and any additional complex chromosome abnormalities at diagnosis as well as during treatment course. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is especially important for cells of CML patients with inadequate or inferior quality metaphases or those with variant Ph translocations. CCA in conjunction with FISH can serve as powerful tools in all phases of CML including the diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification and monitoring of cytogenetic responses to treatment. Molecular techniques such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used for the detection of BCR-ABL1 transcripts at diagnosis whereas quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) is used at the time of diagnosis as well as during TKI therapy for the quantitation of BCR-ABL1 transcripts to evaluate the molecular response and minimal residual disease (MRD). Despite the excellent treatment results obtained after the introduction of TKI drugs, especially Imatinib mesylate (IM), resistance to TKIs develops in approximately 35% - 40% of CML patients on TKI therapy. Since point mutations in BCR-ABL1 are a common cause of IM resistance, mutation analysis is important in IM resistant patients. Mutations are reliably detected by nested PCR amplification of the translocated ABL1 kinase domain followed by direct sequencing of the entire amplified kinase domain. The objective of this review is to highlight the importance of regular and timely CCA, FISH analysis and molecular testing in the diagnosis, prognosis, assessment of therapeutic efficacy, evaluation of MRD and in the detection of BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations which cause therapeutic resistance in adult CML patients.","['Ankathil, R', 'Ismail, S M', 'Mohd Yunus, N', 'Sulong, S', 'Husin, A', 'Abdullah, A D', 'Hassan, R']","['Ankathil R', 'Ismail SM', 'Mohd Yunus N', 'Sulong S', 'Husin A', 'Abdullah AD', 'Hassan R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:44'],"['2020/12/28 11:44 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2020 Dec;42(3):307-321.,20211004,,"['Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Health campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. rankathil@hotmail.com.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed the antitumor effects of synthetic LXR agonist TO901317 in a murine model of syngeneic Lewis Lung carcinoma. Treatment with TO901317 inhibited tumor growth in wild-type, but not in LXR-deficient mice, indicating that the antitumor effects of the agonist depends on functional LXR activity in host cells. Pharmacologic activation of the LXR pathway reduced the intratumoral abundance of regulatory T cells (Treg) and the expression of the Treg-attracting chemokine Ccl17 by MHCII(high) tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Moreover, gene expression profiling indicated a broad negative impact of the LXR agonist on other mechanisms used by TAM for the maintenance of an immunosuppressive environment. In studies exploring the macrophage response to GM-CSF or IL4, activated LXR repressed IRF4 expression, resulting in subsequent downregulation of IRF4-dependent genes including Ccl17. Taken together, this work reveals the combined actions of the LXR pathway in the control of TAM responses that contribute to the antitumoral effects of pharmacologic LXR activation. Moreover, these data provide new insights for the development of novel therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals unrecognized roles of LXR in the transcriptional control of the tumor microenvironment and suggests use of a synthetic LXR agonist as a novel therapeutic strategy to stimulate antitumor activity.","['Carbo, Jose M', 'Leon, Theresa E', 'Font-Diaz, Joan', 'De la Rosa, Juan Vladimir', 'Castrillo, Antonio', 'Picard, Felix R', 'Staudenraus, Daniel', 'Huber, Magdalena', 'Cedo, Lidia', 'Escola-Gil, Joan Carles', 'Campos, Lucia', 'Bakiri, Latifa', 'Wagner, Erwin F', 'Caelles, Carme', 'Stratmann, Thomas', 'Van Ginderachter, Jo A', 'Valledor, Annabel F']","['Carbo JM', 'Leon TE', 'Font-Diaz J', 'De la Rosa JV', 'Castrillo A', 'Picard FR', 'Staudenraus D', 'Huber M', 'Cedo L', 'Escola-Gil JC', 'Campos L', 'Bakiri L', 'Wagner EF', 'Caelles C', 'Stratmann T', 'Van Ginderachter JA', 'Valledor AF']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8301-5360', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0958-5995', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7686-2278', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1443-7548', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7624-4704', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2963-0693', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9021-2485', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7872-0196', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4442-7474', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4232-2633']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201223,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:42'],"['2019/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 11:42 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-19-3360 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-3360 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 Feb 15;81(4):968-985. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-3360.

To counteract the consequences of DNA lesions, cells have evolved several DNA repair systems, among which base excision repair is one of the most important systems. Many currently used antitumor drugs act by damaging DNA, and DNA repair often interferes with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer cells. Tumors are usually extremely genetically heterogeneous, often bearing mutations in DNA repair genes. Thus, knowledge of the functionality of cancer-related variants of proteins involved in DNA damage response and repair is of great interest for personalization of cancer therapy. Although computational methods to predict the variant functionality have attracted much attention, at present, they are mostly based on sequence conservation and make little use of modern capabilities in computational analysis of 3D protein structures. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) to model the structures of 20 clinically observed variants of a DNA repair enzyme, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase.

Nonetheless, approximately one-third of the CP-CML patient's progress to advanced phases of CML (accelerated and blast phase). Impaired DNA repair including mutations in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are responsible for progression of many cancers. Nevertheless, FA-pathways genes have never been reported in myeloid cancers. Hence, this study was aimed to discover DNA repair genes associated with CML progression. AP-CML patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing along with appropriate controls. A novel splice site FANCD2 mutation was detected. FANCD2 is a well-known FA-pathway gene with established role in DNA repair. This is first report of FA-pathway DNA repair genes in myeloid cancers that can serve as a novel marker of CML progression to clinically intervene CML progression. Further studies are needed to establish the functional role of FANCD2 in CML progression that can provide novel insights into CML pathogenesis. This study also indicates that a combination TKIs and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib (FDA approved anti-cancer drug for FA-pathway gene mutations) could improve the clinical outcome CML patients in accelerated and blast-crisis phases of the disease.","['Absar, Muhammad', 'Mahmood, Amer', 'Akhtar, Tanveer', 'Basit, Sulman', 'Ramzan, Khushnooda', 'Jameel, Abid', 'Afzal, Sibtain', 'Ullah, Anhar', 'Qureshi, Kulsoom', 'Alanazi, Nawaf', 'Iqbal, Zafar']","['Absar M', 'Mahmood A', 'Akhtar T', 'Basit S', 'Ramzan K', 'Jameel A', 'Afzal S', 'Ullah A', 'Qureshi K', 'Alanazi N', 'Iqbal Z']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,Pak J Pharm Sci,Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,9426356,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:40'],"['2020/12/28 11:40 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pak J Pharm Sci. 2020 May;33(3(Special)):1419-1426.,20210806,,"['Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetics Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Stem Cell Unit, Department of Anatomy College of Medicine King Khalid University Hospital King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.', 'Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetics Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Center for Genetics and Inherited Diseases, Taibah University, Almadinah Almunawwarah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, HMC, Peshawar, KP, Pakistan.', 'Deptt. of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied & Health Sciences, Imperial College of Business Studies, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Cardiac Sciences, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, HMC, Peshawar, KP, Pakistan.', 'Cancer and Medical Genetics, CAMS-A, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences & King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre (KAIMRC), King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer and Medical Genetics, CAMS-A, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences & King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre (KAIMRC), King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FANCD2 protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Precision Medicine', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*RNA Splice Sites', '*Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although PEGylation can prolong the circulating half-life of ASNase, however, it also induces anti-PEG antibodies that lead to accelerated blood clearance (ABC) and hypersensitivity reactions. Here, we create an urchin-like polypeptide-ASNase conjugate P(CB-EG3Glu)-ASNase, in which the surface of ASNase is sufficiently shielded by an array of zwitterionic helical polypeptides through the labeling of the epsilon-amine of lysine. The conjugate is fully characterized with size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism. In vitro, P(CB-EG3Glu)-ASNase retains full activity based on the enzymatic assay using the Nessler's reagent and cell viability assay. In vivo, examination of the enzyme activity in serum indicates that P(CB-EG3Glu)-ASNase prolongs the circulating half-life of ASNase for ~20 fold. Moreover, P(CB-EG3Glu)-ASNase significantly inhibits tumor growth in a xenografted mouse model using human NKYS cells. Importantly, P(CB-EG3Glu)-ASNase elicits almost no antidrug or antipolymer antibodies without inducing ABC effect, which is in sharp contrast with a similarly produced PEG-ASNase conjugate that develops both antidrug/antipolymer antibodies and profound ABC phenomenon. Our results demonstrate that urchin-like conjugates are outstanding candidates for reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins, and P(CB-EG3Glu)-ASNase holds great promises for the treatment of various lymphoma diseases.","['Hu, Yali', 'Wang, Dedao', 'Wang, Hao', 'Zhao, Ruichi', 'Wang, Yaoyi', 'Shi, Yunfei', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Xie, Yan', 'Song, Yu-Qin', 'Lu, Hua']","['Hu Y', 'Wang D', 'Wang H', 'Zhao R', 'Wang Y', 'Shi Y', 'Zhu J', 'Xie Y', 'Song YQ', 'Lu H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201217,Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/12/28 11:18'],"['2020/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 11:18 [entrez]']","['S0142-9612(20)30852-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120606 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2021 Jan;268:120606. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120606.

However, the derived toxicity and subsequent mechanisms related to their adverse effects are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we compared the mitochondrial and developmental toxicity of azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin using zebrafish embryo/larvae. The results showed that all three strobilurins inhibited mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration (the potency is pyraclostrobin approximately trifloxystrobin > azoxystrobin). Behavioral changes indicated that sublethal doses of pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin caused hyperactivity of zebrafish larvae in dark cycles, whereas trifloxystrobin resulted in hypoactivity of zebrafish larvae. In addition, pyraclostrobin exposure impaired the inflation of swim bladder, and caused down-regulation of annexin A5 (anxa5) mRNA levels, and up-regulated transcript levels of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1a (pbx1a); conversely, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin did not cause detectable effects with swim bladder inflation. Molecular docking results indicated that azoxystrobin had higher interacting potency with iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD), prolactin receptor (PRLR), antagonistic conformation of thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) compared to pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin; pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin were more likely to interact with the antagonistic conformation of TRbeta and GR, respectively. These results may partially explain the different effects observed in behavior and swim bladder inflation, and also point to potential endocrine disruption induced by these strobilurins. Taken together, our study revealed that all three strobilurins alter mitochondrial bioenergetics and cause developmental toxicity. However, the toxic phenotypes and underlying mechanisms of each chemical may differ, and this requires further investigation. Pyraclostrobin showed higher mitochondrial toxicity at lethal doses and higher developmental toxicity at sublethal doses compared to the two other strobilurins tested.

Humans are also being using pesticides to control insidious animals in daily life. By these practices, a huge volume of pesticides is introduced to the environment. Despite broad-spectrum applicability, pesticides also have hazardous effects on both humans and animals at high and low concentrations. Long-term exposure to pesticides can cause different diseases, like leukemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the brain, breasts, prostate, testis, and ovaries. Reproductive disorders from pesticides include birth defects, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, sterility, and infertility. Therefore, the application of determination and treatment methods for pre-concentration and removal of these toxic materials from the environment appears a vital concern. To date, different materials and approaches have been employed for these purposes. Among these approaches, multifunctional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-assisted adsorption and determination processes have always been in the spotlight. These facts are due to exclusive properties of MOFs in terms of the crystallinity, large surface area, high chemical, and physical stability, and controllable structure as well as unique features of adsorption and determination process in terms of simple, easy, cheap, available method and ability to use in large and industrial scales. In the present work, we illustrate the exceptional features of MOFs as well as the possible mechanism for the adsorption of pesticides by MOFs. The use of these fantastic materials for pre-concentration and removal of pesticides are extensively explored. In addition, the performance of MOFs was compared with other adsorbents. Finally, the new frontiers and prospects of MOFs for the determination, sensing, and removal of pesticides are presented.","['Bagheri, Ahmad Reza', 'Aramesh, Nahal', 'Bilal, Muhammad']","['Bagheri AR', 'Aramesh N', 'Bilal M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201225,Netherlands,Environ Res,Environmental research,0147621,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adsorption mechanism', '*Determination', '*Metal-organic frameworks', '*Pesticides', '*Removal', '*Sensing']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:49'],"['2020/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:49 [entrez]']","['S0013-9351(20)31551-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.envres.2020.110654 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Res. 2021 Mar;194:110654. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2020.110654.

Here we describe how paracetamol augments the effects of DAC on cancer cell proliferation and differentiation, without enhancing DNA damage. Firstly, DAC specifically upregulates cyclooxygenase-2-prostaglandin E2 pathway, inadvertently providing cancer cells with survival potential, while the addition of paracetamol offsets this effect. Secondly, in the presence of paracetamol, DAC treatment leads to glutathione depletion and finally to accumulation of ROS and/or mitochondrial superoxide, both of which have the potential to restrict tumour growth. The benefits of combined treatment are demonstrated here in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines, further corroborated in a HNSCC xenograft mouse model and through mining of publicly available DAC and paracetamol responses. The sensitizing effect of paracetamol supplementation is specific to DAC but not its analogue 5-azacitidine. In summary, the addition of paracetamol could allow for DAC dose reduction, widening its clinical usability and providing a strong rationale for consideration in cancer therapy.","['Gleneadie, Hannah J', 'Baker, Amy H', 'Batis, Nikolaos', 'Bryant, Jennifer', 'Jiang, Yao', 'Clokie, Samuel J H', 'Mehanna, Hisham', 'Garcia, Paloma', 'Gendoo, Deena M A', 'Roberts, Sally', 'Burley, Megan', 'Molinolo, Alfredo A', 'Gutkind, J Silvio', 'Scheven, Ben A', 'Cooper, Paul R', 'Parish, Joanna L', 'Khanim, Farhat L', 'Wiench, Malgorzata']","['Gleneadie HJ', 'Baker AH', 'Batis N', 'Bryant J', 'Jiang Y', 'Clokie SJH', 'Mehanna H', 'Garcia P', 'Gendoo DMA', 'Roberts S', 'Burley M', 'Molinolo AA', 'Gutkind JS', 'Scheven BA', 'Cooper PR', 'Parish JL', 'Khanim FL', 'Wiench M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210105,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acetaminophen', '*Acute myeloid leukaemia', '*Decitabine', '*Epigenetic therapies', '*Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:47'],"['2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:47 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(20)30700-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2020.12.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2021 Mar 31;501:172-186. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2020.12.029.

L-asparaginase is widely used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and other cancers. Here, for the first time, the effects of a novel yeast L-asparaginase from Yarrowia lipolytica were studied on human lung (A549) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines as the solid cancer cell lines in terms of cell growth and metastasis inhibition. Functional analysis showed the L-asparagine deprivation mediated anti-proliferation effects by apoptosis induction and changes in the expression of target genes involved in apoptosis and migration pathways. The qRT-PCR analysis showed the higher expression levels of pro-apoptosis genes, including Bax, P53, caspase 3, caspase 8, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic gene in treated cells. On the other hand, there was no increase in ROS production in the treated cells. However, L-asparaginase treatment was able to significantly induce autophagy activation in A549 cells. Besides, wound healing assay showed that L-asparaginase could considerably inhibit the migration of A549 and MCF7 cells.

The outcome of AML is still unsatisfactory. CD123 and CD200 were demonstrated to play important roles in hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of CD200 and CD123 overexpression and the influence of both proteins on the clinical presentation and disease outcome. Bone marrow (BM) samples from 89 pediatric AML patients were obtained at presentation and after therapy. Cells from the bulk population and from the leukemia stem cell (LSC) compartment were examined by multi parametric flow cytometry. In the bulk population, CD200 was positive in 64/89 (71.9) samples, CD123 was positive in 62/89 (69.7%) samples, and dual CD200 and CD123 positivity was observed in 54/89 (60.7%) samples. CD200/CD123 expressions were observed in LSCs in 64/60 samples respectively (71.9%/67.4%), and co-expressed in 51 samples (57.3%). CD200 was overexpressed in secondary AML (p < 0.05). A multivariate analysis revealed that minimal residual disease (MRD) and lymphadenopathy were associated with CD200 overexpression. Moreover, lymphadenopathy, low platelet count, and MRD were independently associated with CD123 expression. The co-expression of CD200 and CD123 demonstrated a statistically significant relationship with unfavorable cytogenetic karyotypes and high total leucocyte count (TLC). The expression of CD200 and CD123 alone and together had an adverse impact on complete remission (CR), MRD positivity, and overall survival (OS). Cases with MRD on day 28 after induction displayed stable expression patterns of CD200 and CD123. CD200 and CD123 both had a negative influence on clinical presentation and treatment outcome, which remarkably worsened when both were concomitantly overexpressed. CD200 and CD123 can therefore be used as markers of MRD in AML and may also serve as therapeutic targets.","['Kandeel, Eman Z', 'Madney, Youssef', 'Eldin, Dalia Negm', 'Shafik, Nevine F']","['Kandeel EZ', 'Madney Y', 'Eldin DN', 'Shafik NF']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CD123', '*CD200', '*Flow cytometry', '*Leukemia stem cells', '*Pediatric leukemia']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:40'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:40 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(20)30874-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2020.104597 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2021 Feb;118:104597. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2020.104597.

Acyclovir is frequently used for treatment against VZV reactivation. However, long-term use of acyclovir can result in the emergence of VZV strain resistant to acyclovir. Here, we report a 67-year-old man with adult T-cell leukemia who suffered from herpes zoster with acyclovir-resistant VZV after long-term prophylaxis. The isolated viruses from his skin lesions were a mixture of acyclovir-resistant and acyclovir-susceptible strains. Sequence analysis showed the presence of thymidine kinase (TK) mutations in the resistant clones. Interestingly, oral administration of famciclovir, a prodrug form of penciclovir, resulted in resolution of his herpes zoster, although most acyclovir-resistant strains of VZV were reported to be resistant to penciclovir. This implied that a certain amount of susceptible VZV with wild-type viral TK gene was present in vivo, and that famciclovir could be phosphorylated intracellularly by the intact viral kinases. As famciclovir is more potent and longer-acting than acyclovir, the susceptible strains might have suppressed the generation and proliferation of the resistant in vivo. Even when VZV is developing resistance to acyclovir, famciclovir might be effective at least in the early resistant phase.","['Oka, Tomomi', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Yamashita, Kouhei', 'Shiraki, Kimiyasu', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Oka T', 'Hishizawa M', 'Yamashita K', 'Shiraki K', 'Takaori-Kondo A']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201225,Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acyclovir', 'Famciclovir', 'Mutation', 'Thymidine kinase (TK)', 'Varicella zoster virus (VZV)']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:38'],"['2020/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:38 [entrez]']","['S1341-321X(20)30448-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jiac.2020.12.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 2021 May;27(5):755-758. doi: 10.1016/j.jiac.2020.12.013.

However, the pathogenesis of AML is not fully understood at present. In this work, an integrated approach based untargeted metabolomics and network pharmacology was adopted to elucidate the pathogenesis of AML. Metabolic profiling of plasma samples from 14 patients and 16 healthy individuals were performed based on UHPLC-MS platform. As a result, 23 metabolites were identified by using the human metabolite database based on PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis) and independent sample test. And metabolic pathways related to AML mainly included fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and lipid metabolism. Meanwhile, biomarkers-targets-pathways-disease network was constructed, 75 biomarker targets and 122 disease targets were identified. Furthermore, 30 pathways were predicted, some of which were consistent with these in metabolomics. This is the first time that metabolomics and network pharmacology approach have been combined to investigate the pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of AML. ALDH, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 were potential therapeutic targets for AML, which provide available way to elucidate the pathogenesis and treatment of AML.","['Yuan, Yunxia', 'Wu, Qiong', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Feng, Zhiao', 'Dong, Jiani', 'An, Ming', 'Wu, Guodong', 'Qin, Feng', 'Zhao, Longshan']","['Yuan Y', 'Wu Q', 'Zhao J', 'Feng Z', 'Dong J', 'An M', 'Wu G', 'Qin F', 'Zhao L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,England,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,8309336,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Metabolomics', 'Multivariate statistical analysis', 'Network pharmacology', 'UHPLC-MS']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:33'],"['2020/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:33 [entrez]']","['S0731-7085(20)31710-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpba.2020.113824 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2021 Feb 20;195:113824. doi: 10.1016/j.jpba.2020.113824.

We aimed to establish the baseline characteristics and outcomes of paediatric patients with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the pre-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor era. METHODS: This multicentre, retrospective, cohort study included paediatric patients (aged 1-18 years) with newly diagnosed ABL-class fusion (ABL1 fusion-positive, ABL2 fusion-positive, CSF1R fusion-positive, and PDGFRB fusion-positive) B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia enrolled in clinical trials of multidrug chemotherapy done between Oct 3, 2000, and Aug 28, 2018, in which tyrosine-kinase inhibitors had not been given as a first-line treatment. Patients from 14 European, North American, and Asia-Pacific study groups of the Ponte di Legno group were included. No patients were excluded, and patients were followed up by individual study groups. Through the Ponte di Legno group, we collected data on the baseline characteristics of patients, including IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A/B deletion status, and whether haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had been done, as well as treatment outcomes, including complete remission, no response, relapse, early death, and treatment-related mortality, response to prednisone, and minimal residual disease (MRD) at end of induction therapy. 5-year event-free survival and 5-year overall survival were estimated by use of Kaplan-Meier methods, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was calculated by use of a competing risk model. FINDINGS: We identified 122 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (77 from European study groups, 25 from North American study groups, and 20 from Asia-Pacific study groups). 64 (52%) of 122 patients were PDGFRB fusion-positive, 40 (33%) were ABL1 fusion-positive, ten (8%) were CSF1R fusion-positive, and eight (7%) were ABL2 fusion-positive. In all 122 patients, 5-year event-free survival was 59.1% (95% CI 50.5-69.1), 5-year overall survival was 76.1% (68.6-84.5), and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 31.0% (95% CI 22.4-40.1). MRD at the end of induction therapy was high (>/=10(-2) cells) in 61 (66%) of 93 patients, and most prevalent in patients with ABL2 fusions (six [86%] of 7 patients) and PDGFRB fusion-positive B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (43 [88%] of 49 patients). MRD at the end of induction therapy of 10(-2) cells or more was predictive of an unfavourable outcome (hazard ratio of event-free survival in patients with a MRD of >/=10(-2)vs those with a MRD of <10(-2) 3.33 [95% CI 1.46-7.56], p=0.0039). Of the 36 (30%) of 119 patients who relapsed, 25 (69%) relapsed within 3 years of diagnosis. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse in 41 patients who underwent HSCT (17.8% [95% CI 7.7-31.3]) was lower than in the 43 patients who did not undergo HSCT (45.1% [28.4-60.5], p=0.013), but event-free survival and overall survival did not differ between these two groups. INTERPRETATION: Children with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia have poor outcomes when treated with regimens that do not contain a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, despite the use of high-risk chemotherapy regimens and frequent HSCT upon first remission. Our findings provide a reference for evaluating the potential benefit of first-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment in patients with ABL-class fusion B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.

METHODS: SWOG-1211 is a randomised phase 2 trial comparing eight cycles of lenalidomide (25 mg orally on days 1-14 every 21 days), bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days), and dexamethasone (20 mg orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 every 21 days; RVd) induction followed by dose-attenuated RVd maintenance (bortezomib 1 mg/m(2) subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide 15 mg orally on days 1-21; dexamethasone 12 mg orally on days 1, 18, and 15 every 28 days) until disease progression with or without elotuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 for cycles 1-2, on days 1 and 11 for cycles 3-8, and on days 1 and 15 during maintenance). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either RVd or RVd-elotuzumab. High-risk multiple myeloma was defined by one of the following: gene expression profiling high risk (GEP(hi)), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17p) or amp1q21, primary plasma cell leukaemia and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (two times the upper limit of normal or more). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, and all analyses were done on intention-to-treat basis among eligible patients who were evaluable for response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01668719. FINDINGS: 100 (RVd n=52, RVd-elotuzumab n=48) patients were enrolled between Oct 27, 2013, and May 15, 2016, across 26 cooperative group institutions in the USA. Median age was 64 years (IQR 57-70, range 36-85). 74 (75%) of 99 had International Staging System stage II or stage III disease, 47 (47%) of 99 had amp1q21, 37 (37%) of 100 had del17p, 11 (11%) of 100 had t(14;16), eight (9%) of 90 were GEP(hi), seven (7%) of 100 had primary plasma cell leukaemia, five (5%) of 100 had t(14;20), four (4%) of 100 had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and 17 (17%) had two or more features. With a median follow-up of 53 months (IQR 46-59), no difference in median progression-free survival was observed (RVd 33.64 months [95% CI 19.55-not reached], RVd-elotuzumab 31.47 months [18.56-53.98]; hazard ratio 0.968 [80% CI 0.697-1.344]; one-sided p=0.45]. 37 (71%) of 52 patients in the RVd group and 37 (77%) of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group had grade 3 or worse adverse events. No significant differences in the safety profile were observed, although some notable results included grade 3-5 infections (four [8%] of 52 in the RVd group, eight [17%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group), sensory neuropathy (four [8%] of 52 in the RVd group, six [13%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group), and motor neuropathy (one [2%] of 52 in the RVd group, four [8%] of 48 in the RVd-elotuzumab group). There were no treatment-related deaths in the RVd group and one death in the RVd-elotuzumab group for which study treatment was listed as possibly contributing by the investigator. INTERPRETATION: In the first randomised study of high-risk multiple myeloma reported to date, the addition of elotuzumab to RVd induction and maintenance did not improve patient outcomes. However, progression-free survival in both study groups exceeded the original statistical assumptions and supports the role for continuous proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drug combination maintenance therapy for this patient population.

Metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to utilize fructose confers advantages for their malignant growth, but compelling therapeutic targets have not been identified. Here, we show that fructose metabolism of leukemic cells can be inhibited by targeting the de novo serine synthesis pathway (SSP). Leukemic cells, unlike their normal counterparts, become significantly dependent on the SSP in fructose-rich conditions as compared to glucose-rich conditions. This metabolic program is mediated by the ratio of redox cofactors, NAD(+)/NADH, and the increased SSP flux is beneficial for generating alpha-ketoglutarate from glutamine, which allows leukemic cells to proliferate even in the absence of glucose. Inhibition of PHGDH, a rate-limiting enzyme in the SSP, dramatically reduces leukemia engraftment in mice in the presence of high fructose, confirming the essential role of the SSP in the metabolic plasticity of leukemic cells.","['Jeong, Sangmoo', 'Savino, Angela Maria', 'Chirayil, Rachel', 'Barin, Ersilia', 'Cheng, Yuanming', 'Park, Sun-Mi', 'Schurer, Alexandra', 'Mullarky, Edouard', 'Cantley, Lewis C', 'Kharas, Michael G', 'Keshari, Kayvan R']","['Jeong S', 'Savino AM', 'Chirayil R', 'Barin E', 'Cheng Y', 'Park SM', 'Schurer A', 'Mullarky E', 'Cantley LC', 'Kharas MG', 'Keshari KR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201222,United States,Cell Metab,Cell metabolism,101233170,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*in vivo isotope tracing', '*metabolic flux', '*redox', '*serine synthesis pathway']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:16'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:16 [entrez]']","['S1550-4131(20)30660-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cmet.2020.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Metab. 2021 Jan 5;33(1):145-159.e6. doi: 10.1016/j.cmet.2020.12.005.

Major challenges in drugging p53 mutations include heterogeneous mechanisms of inactivation and the absence of broadly applicable allosteric sites. Here we report the identification of small molecules, including arsenic trioxide (ATO), an established agent in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, as cysteine-reactive compounds that rescue structural p53 mutations. Crystal structures of arsenic-bound p53 mutants reveal a cryptic allosteric site involving three arsenic-coordinating cysteines within the DNA-binding domain, distal to the zinc-binding site. Arsenic binding stabilizes the DNA-binding loop-sheet-helix motif alongside the overall beta-sandwich fold, endowing p53 mutants with thermostability and transcriptional activity. In cellular and mouse xenograft models, ATO reactivates mutant p53 for tumor suppression. Investigation of the 25 most frequent p53 mutations informs patient stratification for clinical exploration.

However, its potential role in adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is unclear. Therefore, we aim to clarify the abnormal expression of the tumor-associated biomarker, RASD1, as a potential target for diagnosis and prognosis in adult Philadelphia-negative B-ALL. METHODS: The expression of RASD1 was detected with RT-qPCR in 92 adults with de novo Ph-negative B-ALL and 40 healthy controls. The correlation between RASD1 transcript levels and relapse was assessed. RESULTS: RASD1 transcript levels in patients with Ph-negative B-ALL (median 81.76%, range 0.22%-1824.52%) were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (7.59%, 0.46%-38.66%; P<0.0001). Patients with low RASD1 transcript levels had a lower 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS, 47.5% [32.9%, 62.1%] vs. 63.1% [49.0%, 77.2%]; P = 0.012) and a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 52.0% [37.4%, 66.6%] vs. 36.2% [22.2%, 50.2%]; P = 0.013) especially in patients receiving chemotherapy only. Multivariate analysis showed that a low RASD1 transcript level was an independent risk factor for RFS (HR = 2.938 [1.427, 6.047], P = 0.003) and CIR (HR = 3.367 [1.668, 6.796], P = 0.001) in patients with Ph-negative B-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: RASD1 transcript levels were significantly higher in patients with Ph-negative B-ALL and a low RASD1 transcript level was independently correlated with increased relapse risk.","['Lu, Run-Qing', 'Wu, Li-Xin', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Lu RQ', 'Wu LX', 'Zhang J', 'Qin YZ', 'Liu YR', 'Lai YY', 'Jiang H', 'Chang YJ', 'Ruan GR', 'Huang XJ']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-6643'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['RASD1', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'relapse', 'transcript level']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:14'],"['2020/12/28 10:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1860359 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):9-15. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1860359.,20210510,,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RASD1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to identify a novel miRNA that can predict prognosis of childhood ALL patients and explore its potential mechanism. METHODS: The miRNA expression profiles of childhood ALL were analyzed using GEO database and HiSeq instruments. The expression of miR-155 was examined by RT-PCR in 42 ALL patients. To investigate the role of miR-155 in ALL, four ALL cell lines (CEM-C1, Jurkat, MOLT-3 and MOLT-4) were transfected with miR-155 mimics, miR-155 inhibitors or corresponding controls. Dual-luciferase reporter system was applied to confirm the miR-155 target ZNF238. Moreover, proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Dataset GSE56489 and GSE23024 demonstrated that miR-155 was up-regulated and ZNF238 was down-regulated at diagnosis status of ALL. High miR-155 expression was associated with poor outcome. Overexpressed miR-155 promoted ALL cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter result showed that miR-155 directly regulated ZNF238. Silencing ZNF238 promoted cell proliferation in ALL cells. DISCUSSION: Our research indicating that miR-155 might possess potential value as a biomarker for predicting the prognosis of individuals. However, the role of ZNF238 in childhood ALL remain unknown. In the present study, we found the possible role of ZNF238 as a new tumor suppressor in ALL, which might be necessary for the antiproliferative functions of normal cells to counteract ALL formation. CONCLUSION: Our results propose that miR-155 is in association with poor prognosis of childhood ALL. Furthermore, miR-155 could promote cell proliferation targeting ZNF238.","['Liang, Cong', 'Li, Yu', 'Wang, Li-Na', 'Zhang, Xiao-Li', 'Luo, Jie-Si', 'Peng, Chun-Jin', 'Tang, Wen-Yan', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Tang, Yan-Lai', 'Luo, Xue-Qun']","['Liang C', 'Li Y', 'Wang LN', 'Zhang XL', 'Luo JS', 'Peng CJ', 'Tang WY', 'Huang LB', 'Tang YL', 'Luo XQ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['MiR-155', 'ZNF238', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'prognosis', 'proliferation', 'children', 'miRNA', 'treatment']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:14'],"['2020/12/28 10:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1860187 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):16-25. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1860187.,20210510,,"[""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZBTB18 protein, human)']","['Adolescent', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognostic impact of the grade of thrombocytopenia on OS and disease-free survival (DFS) has never been explored. Methods: We conducted an extended analysis of a retrospective study. Newly diagnosed adults with ALL was enrolled in this study. The grade of thrombocytopenia was evaluated in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Prognostic impacts were assessed by the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Results: A total of 90 participants were included in this study. There were 18 cases with grade 4 thrombocytopenia among the 71 participants presented with thrombocytopenia of any grade. Both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested the independent negative prognostic impact of grade 4 thrombocytopenia on both OS (HR = 4.73, 95% CI = 1.95-11.52) and DFS (HR = 9.82, 95% CI = 3.14-30.76) of adult ALL, using the cohort of patients with no thrombocytopenia as a reference. In addition, treatment regimen, cytogenetic profile, time to treatment, and platelet count were independent prognostic factors of the OS. We also found that treatment regimen, cytogenetic profile, and peripheral blood blast percentage were independent prognostic factors of the DFS. Conclusion: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was a negative prognostic factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Srisurapanont, Karan', 'Prakalapakorn, Wimuthtisuk', 'Sutamworarot, Chotsurat', 'Siriraksa, Teerach', 'Jinapeng, Metapon', 'Rattanathammethee, Thanawat']","['Srisurapanont K', 'Prakalapakorn W', 'Sutamworarot C', 'Siriraksa T', 'Jinapeng M', 'Rattanathammethee T']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9296-6344', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1886-9591', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2731-4889']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'GMALL regimen', 'Hyper-CVAD regimen', 'adult', 'pediatric regimen', 'prognosis', 'thrombocytopenia']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:13'],"['2020/12/28 10:13 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1856512 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):26-30. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1856512.,20210510,,"['Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['Thrombocytopenia 4'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocytopenia/*complications/diagnosis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indoor air pollution was evaluated by questionnaires and quantitative measurement including 14 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the homes of the two groups. The levels of individual VOCs, VOC families, TVOC (sum of the concentrations of the individual VOCs) and NO2 were compared between the two groups. Exposure to styrene and butyl alcohol were associated with an increased risk of childhood AL (styrene: odds ratio (OR)=2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-5.07; butyl alcohol: OR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.19-5.28); 4th quartile of chlorinated hydrocarbons (OR = 2.52, 95%CI: 1.02-6.26) and 3rd quartile of TVOC (OR = 4.03, 95%CI: 1.06-6.81) had significant higher ORs for childhood AL compared with that in the lowest quartiles.

While MYC is a potent inducer of apoptosis, it often suppresses cellular senescence, which together with apoptosis is an important barrier against tumor development. For this latter function, MYC is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Here, we utilized a MYC/BCL-XL-driven mouse model of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 can inhibit MYC-driven tumorigenesis through induction of senescence. Purified mouse hematopoietic stem cells transduced with MYC and BCL-XL were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice, leading to the development of massive leukemia and subsequent death 15-17 days after transplantation. Upon disease onset, mice were treated with the selective CDK2 inhibitor CVT2584 or vehicle either by daily intraperitoneal injections or continuous delivery via mini-pumps. CVT2584 treatment delayed disease onset and moderately but significantly improved survival of mice. Flow cytometry revealed a significant decrease in tumor load in the spleen, liver and bone marrow of CVT2584-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice. This was correlated with induced senescence evidenced by reduced cell proliferation, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and heterochromatin foci, expression of p19(ARF) and p21(CIP1), and reduced phosphorylation (activation) of pRb, while very few apoptotic cells were observed. In addition, phosphorylation of MYC at Ser-62 was decreased. In summary, inhibition of CDK2 delayed MYC/BCL-XL-driven AML linked to senescence induction. Our results suggest that CDK2 is a promising target for pro-senescence cancer therapy, in particular for MYC-driven tumors, including leukemia.","['Bazzar, Wesam', 'Bocci, Matteo', 'Hejll, Eduar', 'Hogqvist Tabor, Vedrana', 'Hydbring, Per', 'Grandien, Alf', 'Alzrigat, Mohammad', 'Larsson, Lars-Gunnar']","['Bazzar W', 'Bocci M', 'Hejll E', 'Hogqvist Tabor V', 'Hydbring P', 'Grandien A', 'Alzrigat M', 'Larsson LG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8774-0006', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6914-3147']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201227,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL-XL', '*CDK2', '*MYC', '*leukemia', '*mouse models', '*senescence']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:11'],"['2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:11 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2020.1855740 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2021 Jan;20(1):23-38. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2020.1855740.

Hence, there has been an intense effort to develop various methods for investigating RNA modifications and their roles in various organisms, including sequencing-based approaches and, more frequently, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based methods. Although LC-MS offers numerous advantages, such as being highly sensitive and quantitative over a broad detection range, some stationary phase chemistries struggle to resolve positional isomers. Furthermore, the demand for detailed analyses of complex biological samples often necessitates long separation times, hampering sample-to-sample turnover and making multisample analyses time consuming. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an ultra-performance LC-MS (UPLC-MS) method that uses an octadecyl carbon chain (C18)-bonded silica matrix for the efficient separation of 50 modified ribonucleosides, including positional isomers, in a single 9-min sample-to-sample run. To validate the performance and versatility of our method, we analysed tRNA modification patterns of representative microorganisms from each domain of life, namely Archaea (Methanosarcina acetivorans), Bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae), and Eukarya (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Additionally, our method is flexible and readily applicable for detection and relative quantification using stable isotope labelling and targeted approaches like multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). In conclusion, this method represents a fast and robust tool for broad-range exploration and quantification of ribonucleosides, facilitating future homoeostasis studies of RNA modification in complex biological samples.","['Gregorova, Pavlina', 'Sipari, Nina H', 'Sarin, L Peter']","['Gregorova P', 'Sipari NH', 'Sarin LP']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0737-8845', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0786-2493', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4400-3601']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201223,United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*C18', '*UPLC-MS', '*post-transcriptional nucleoside modification', '*quantification', '*transfer RNA', '*translation']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:11'],"['2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:11 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15476286.2020.1853385 [doi]'],ppublish,RNA Biol. 2021 Oct;18(10):1382-1389. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1853385.

There has been substantial progress in identification of new therapeutic targets, along with approval of at least three targeted therapies for AML in recent years. Nevertheless, treatment has largely remained unchanged over couple of decades, with ~40% patients not achieving remission. AML is a highly heterogenous disease and there is a need for a preclinical platform to understand the heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment that can guide therapy selection. In this study, we employed an ex vivo tumor explant model to study tumor microenvironment and to select a treatment course for AML patients. Our data reveal dysregulation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) in a subset of AML patients. Based on this observation, epigenetic modulators azacitidine and panobinostat alone and in combination, were evaluated as treatment regimens in cytarabine refractory tumors. More than 50% of the treated samples showed response to the combination therapy. In order to explore alternate treatment modalities for tumors refractory to these epigenetic modulators, TCGA data analysis was done which revealed increased expression and hypomethylation of IFNGR1/2, suggesting activation of JAK/STAT pathway in AML. This was further interrogated ex vivo, with p-STAT3 expression in patients' samples. Fedratinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor was evaluated and 78% tumor efficacy response was achieved. Taken together, our data indicate that ex vivo platform derived from patient samples is capable in guiding optimal therapy selection for various classes of drugs including identification of novel targeted therapies.","['Babu, Govind', 'Chaudhuri, Padmaparna', 'Rajappa, Manoj', 'Biswas, Manjusha', 'Sansar, Bipinesh', 'Rajegowda, Chethan', 'Radhakrishnan, Aneesha', 'Advani, Jayshree', 'Tewary, Biplab', 'Radhakrishnan, Padhma', 'Thiyagarajan, Saravanan', 'Chatterjee, Aditi', 'Upadhayaya, Ram Shankar', 'Majumder, Pradip K']","['Babu G', 'Chaudhuri P', 'Rajappa M', 'Biswas M', 'Sansar B', 'Rajegowda C', 'Radhakrishnan A', 'Advani J', 'Tewary B', 'Radhakrishnan P', 'Thiyagarajan S', 'Chatterjee A', 'Upadhayaya RS', 'Majumder PK']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8474-5824'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201227,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*epigenetic modulators', '*ex vivo explant', '*fedratinib']",2020/12/29 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:11'],"['2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:11 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2020.1831371 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2021 Jan 2;22(1):66-78. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2020.1831371.

The United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute AML17 trial randomly assigned patients who were not high risk to a total of three versus four courses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received two induction courses based on daunorubicin and cytarabine (Ara-C), usually with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Following remission, 1,017 patients were randomly assigned to a third course, MACE (amsacrine, Ara-C, and etoposide), plus a fourth course of MidAc (mitoxantrone and Ara-C) and following an amendment to one or two courses of high-dose Ara-C. Primary end points were cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Outcomes were correlated with patient characteristics, mutations, cytogenetics, induction treatments, and measurable residual disease (MRD) postinduction. RESULTS: In logrank analyses, CIR and RFS at 5 years were improved in recipients of four courses (50% v 58%: hazard ratio [HR] 0.81 [0.69-0.97], P = .02 and 43% v 36%: HR 0.83 [0.71-0.98], P = .03, respectively). While OS was not significantly better (63% v 57%: HR 0.84 [0.69-1.03], P = .09), the noninferiority of three courses to four courses was not established. The impact on relapse was only significant when the fourth course was Ara-C. In exploratory analyses, although MRD impacted survival, a fourth course had no effect in either MRD-positive or MRD-negative patients. A fourth course was beneficial in patients who lacked a mutation of FLT3 or NPM1, had < 3 mutations in other genes, or had a presenting WBC of < 10 x 10(9) L(-1). CONCLUSION: Although a fourth course of high-dose Ara-C reduced CIR and improved RFS, it did not result in a significant OS benefit. Subsets including those with favorable cytogenetics, those lacking a mutation of FLT3 or NPM1, or those with < 3 other mutations may derive survival benefit.","['Burnett, Alan K', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Knapper, Stephen', 'Freeman, Sylvie', 'Huntly, Brian', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Thomas, Ian F', 'Kjeldsen, Lars', 'McMullin, Mary Frances', 'Drummond, Mark', 'Kell, Jonathan', 'Spearing, Ruth']","['Burnett AK', 'Russell NH', 'Hills RK', 'Knapper S', 'Freeman S', 'Huntly B', 'Clark RE', 'Thomas IF', 'Kjeldsen L', 'McMullin MF', 'Drummond M', 'Kell J', 'Spearing R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1893-8155', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6405-4441', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1869-180X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0312-161X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1261-3299', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0773-0204', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5334-6940', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8412-2352']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20201223,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:07'],"['2022/03/10 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:07 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.01170 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Mar 10;39(8):890-901. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.01170.

NRRL S-4 with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the following chromatographic isolation led to the discovery of four 20-membered macrolides, venturicidin A (4) and three new congeners venturicidins D-F (1-3). Genome sequencing of strain S-4 revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding glycosylated type I polyketides (PKS). The BGC designated to venturicidin biosynthesis (ven) was supported by the proposed biosynthetic pathway and confirmed by inactivation of the core PKS gene of venK. Bioinformatic analyses on the conserved motifs and known stereospecificities in PKS modules are consistent with the structure and absolute configuration. This is the first report of venturicidin BGC since the discovery of the macrolide in 1961. In the biological assays, venturicidin A (4) and E (2) displayed a high selective cytotoxicity against acute monocytic leukemia MV-4-11 cells with IC50 values of 0.09 and 0.94 muM, respectively. Venturicidin A (4) also showed a weak inhibitory activity on FMS-like-tyrosine kinase.","['Li, Huanhuan', 'Zhang, Mengxue', 'Li, Hongji', 'Yu, Hai', 'Chen, Shuo', 'Wu, Wenhui', 'Sun, Peng']","['Li H', 'Zhang M', 'Li H', 'Yu H', 'Chen S', 'Wu W', 'Sun P']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1710-8582', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9508-2904']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201223,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2020/12/28 10:06'],"['2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/28 10:06 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c01177 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2021 Jan 22;84(1):110-119. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c01177.

Participants with hepatic impairment and age/weight-matched controls with normal hepatic function received a single oral 100-mg glasdegib dose under fasted conditions. The primary end points were area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf ) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ). Twenty-four participants (8/cohort) were enrolled. Glasdegib plasma exposures in moderate hepatic impairment were similar to controls, with adjusted geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of 110.8% (90% confidence interval [CI], 78.0-157.3) for AUCinf and 94.8% (69.9-128.4) for Cmax versus controls.

AIM: To assess the DKK 1 expression displayed by myeloma cells in bone marrow trephine biopsies of patients with and without osteolytic lesions, and in different malignancy grades of the disease. METHODS: The expression level of DKK 1 was assessed immunohistochemically in bone marrow of 49 MM patients presented with and without osteolytic lesions (the 1(st) and the 2(nd) group, respectively). RESULTS: Levels of weak, moderate, and strong DKK 1 expression were distributed - as 43.33, 27.78 and 25.56%, and 63.91, 18.80, and 1.50%, respectively when evaluating the samples obtained from the 1(st) and the 2(nd) group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment response and survival of 83 patients with CLL complicated by immune cytopenia (IC) were analyzed. Treatment schedules in 58 medicated patients included corticosteroids; chemotherapy (COP, CHOP regimens), immunotherapy (rituximab alone), immunochemotherapy (rituximab-containing regimens - R-COP, R-CHOP). Twenty-five patients underwent splenectomy. RESULTS: The use of corticosteroids, as the first line of treatment, resulted in short-term remission in most patients. Chemotherapy was effective in a half of CLL patients, but duration of the remission did not exceed 32 months in CLL associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. After rituximab monotherapy (10 patients) the stable remission was reached in 60% of the patients with median relapse-free survival of 40 months. Rituximab containing chemotherapy (22 patients) caused the long-term remission in 72% of the patients with median relapse-free survival of 76 months. Splenectomy performed in 25 patients with CLL complicated by IC was effective in 70% of the patients. The outcome of splenectomy depends on IC entity. The best response was registered in associated immune thrombocytopenia (median overall survival 118 months), the worst - in Fisher - Evans syndrome (15 months). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of patients with CLL complicated by ICs should be individualized. For CLL patients without significant enlargement of lymph nodes and spleen, low lymphocytosis, associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia, the monotherapy with rituximab is optimal. In case of occurrence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia or Fisher - Evans syndrome in CLL patients with enlargement of lymph nodes, spleen, significant lymphocytosis, the use of R-COP or R-CHOP schemes, 4-6 courses, is the most effective. Splenectomy is indicated in patients with massive splenomegaly, the resistance to medication, recurrent relapses after adequate therapy.","['Yevstakhevych, Yu L', 'Vyhovska, Ya I', 'Yevstakhevych, I Y', 'Vyhovska, O Y', 'Pelenyo, N V', 'Semerak, M M', 'Novak, V L', 'Loginsky, V E']","['Yevstakhevych YL', 'Vyhovska YI', 'Yevstakhevych IY', 'Vyhovska OY', 'Pelenyo NV', 'Semerak MM', 'Novak VL', 'Loginsky VE']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,IM,,,2020/12/29 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2020/12/28 07:43'],"['2020/12/28 07:43 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['15505 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-4.15505 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2020 Dec;42(4):318-323. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-4.15505.,20210913,,"['State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.', 'State Institution ""Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine"", National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv 79044, Ukraine.']",['0 (Biomarkers)'],"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Autoimmunity', 'Biomarkers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Enzyme digestion method combined with differential adherent method was used to culture neonatal mouse myocardial cells. HR model was established by hypoxia for 24 hours and reoxygenation for 6 hours. The experimental groups including control group (normal cultured cardiomyocytes), Mst-1 empty virus group (cardiomyocytes transfected with recombinant lentiviral empty vector for 48 hours), Mst-1 knockdown group (recombinant lentivirus carrying Mst-1small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into cardiomyocytes for 48 hours), Mst-1 overexpression group (cardiomyocytes were transfected with recombinant lentivirus carrying Mst-1 gene for 48 hours), HR group (cardiomyocytes exposed to HR), Mst-1 knockdown+HR group (HR model of cardiomyocyte was established 48 hours after transfection with recombinant lentivirus carrying Mst-1siRNA) and Mst-1 overexpression+HR group (HR model of cardiomyocyte was established 48 hours after transfection with recombinant lentivirus carrying Mst-1 gene). Real-time fluorescence quantitative RCR (qPCR) and Western blot were used to detect the relative expression of Mst-1 mRNA and protein in the cells, immunofluorescence staining was used to detect cardiomyocyte troponin T (cTnT), and autophagosomes and autophagy enzyme changes. TUNEL method was used to detect myocardial cell apoptosis, Western blot was adopted to detect autophagy-related protein microtubule-related protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) /LC3 , P62 and apoptosis-related protein cleaved-caspase 9, pro-caspase 9, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-3, and myeloid leukemia 1 (MCL-1) expression. MCL-1 inhibitor A1210477 was used to validate the signaling pathway of Mst-1 on regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy. Results: Immunofluorescence detection revealed that the cultured cells expressed cardiomyocyte-specific marker cTnT. The expression of Mst-1 in cardiomyocytes increased in HR model. Lentiviral transfection could effectively inhibit or overexpress Mst-1 in treated cells. The levels of autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes in cardiomyocytes undergoing HR and in Mst-1 overexpression+HR group were lower than those of control group, while autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes in cardiomyocytes of Mst-1 knockdown+HR group was significantly higher than in the HR group (all P<0.05). The TUNEL results showed that the proportion of TUNEL positive cells was significantly increased in the HR group and Mst-1 overexpression+HR group than in the control group, while the proportion of TUNEL positive cells was significantly decreased in the Mst-1 knockdown group+HR group as compared to the HR group (all P<0.05). Western blot results showed that the LC3 /LC3 levels were significantly lower, while the expression levels of P62, cleaved-caspase-9 and cleaved-caspase-3 were significantly higher in the HR group and Mst-1 overexpression+HR group than in control group (all P<0.05). The LC3 /LC3 value was significantly higher, and the expression levels of P62, cleaved-caspase-9 and cleaved-caspase-3 were significantly lower in the Mst-1 knockdown+HR group than in the HR group (P both<0.05). The expression level of P-MCL-1 protein was significantly lower in cardiomyocytes of HR and Mst-1 overexpression+HR group than in control group, and the expression level of P-MCL-1 protein was higher in Mst-1 knockdown+HR group than in HR group (P both<0.05). The recovery experiment showed that inhibiting MCL-1 in cells can block the regulatory effect of Mst-1 siRNA on cell autophagy and apoptosis. Conclusion: Inhibiting Mst-1 expression in cardiomyocytes can promote the autophagy of cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxic reoxygenation and reduce the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes via activating McL-1.","['Wang, Y', 'Zhao, R Z', 'Qiu, Z M', 'Shen, C Y', 'Chen, P K', 'Hao, X', 'Yuan, J S', 'Deng, W W', 'Shi, B']","['Wang Y', 'Zhao RZ', 'Qiu ZM', 'Shen CY', 'Chen PK', 'Hao X', 'Yuan JS', 'Deng WW', 'Shi B']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,7910682,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1', 'Myeloid cell lekemia-1', 'Myocytes, cardiac']",2020/12/29 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/12/28 07:43'],"['2020/12/28 07:43 [entrez]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20201102-00873 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi. 2020 Dec 24;48(12):1060-1069. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20201102-00873.,20201229,,"['Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China.']",,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Hypoxia', 'Mice', '*Myocytes, Cardiac', 'Signal Transduction']",,,"['81860061/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'LH(2014)7576/Science and Technology Fund of Guizhou Province', '(2016)06/Science and Technology Project of Zunyi City', '(2016)51/Master Research Foundation of Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical', 'University']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as a novel cancerrelated lncRNA, the influence of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor antisense RNA 1 (LIFRAS1) in GC cell biological behaviors remains unreported. The present study explored the biological effects of lncRNA LIFRAS1 on GC progression. Reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR was performed to examine lncRNA LIFRAS1 expression in GC tissues and cells. Cell Counting Kit8, 5ethynyl2'deoxyuridine incorporation, cell wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were used to assess the functions of lncRNA LIFRAS1 in GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, associations among lncRNA LIFRAS1, microRNA (miR)4698 and microtubuleassociated tumor suppressor 1 (MTUS1) were investigated via bioinformatics software and a luciferase reporter system. In addition, western blotting was used to examine the expression of MEK and ERK. Decreased lncRNA LIFRAS1 expression was observed in GC tissues and cells. Upregulated lncRNA LIFRAS1 inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Upregulated miR4698 and downregulated MTUS1 were identified in GC tissues and cells. The inhibitory interaction between lncRNA LIFRAS1 and miR4698 was confirmed. Additionally, MTUS1 was predicted as a target gene of miR4698 positively regulated by lncRNA LIFRAS1. The MEK/ERK pathway was inhibited by lncRNA LIFRAS1 via regulating MTUS1. These findings revealed the inhibitory functions of lncRNA LIFRAS1 in GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The process was mediated via miR4698, MTUS1 and the MEK/ERK pathway.","['Zhao, Jiangqiao', 'Li, Xiaoning', 'Fu, Liping', 'Zhang, Na', 'Yang, Jiaping', 'Cai, Jianhui']","['Zhao J', 'Li X', 'Fu L', 'Zhang N', 'Yang J', 'Cai J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*gastric carcinoma', '*long noncoding RNA leukemia inhibitory factor receptor antisense RNA 1', '*microRNA4698', '*microtubuleassociated tumor suppressor 1', '*MEK/ERK pathway']",2020/12/24 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2020/12/23 08:42'],"['2020/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 08:42 [entrez]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2020.11792 [doi]', '153 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Feb;23(2). pii: 153. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2020.11792.

Modern anticancer therapies targeting the epigenetic machinery awaken retroelement expression, inducing antiviral responses that eliminate tumors through mechanisms not completely understood. Here, we find that massive binding of epigenetically activated retroelements by RIG-I and MDA5 viral sensors promotes ATP hydrolysis and depletes intracellular energy, driving tumor killing independently of immune signaling. Energy depletion boosts compensatory ATP production by switching glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thereby reversing the Warburg effect. However, hyperfunctional succinate dehydrogenase in mitochondrial electron transport chain generates excessive oxidative stress that unleashes RIP1-mediated necroptosis. To maintain ATP generation, hyperactive mitochondrial membrane blocks intrinsic apoptosis by increasing BCL2 dependency. Accordingly, drugs targeting BCL2 family proteins and epigenetic inhibitors yield synergistic responses in multiple cancer types. Thus, epigenetic therapy kills cancer cells by rewiring mitochondrial metabolism upon retroelement activation, which primes mitochondria to apoptosis by BH3-mimetics. SIGNIFICANCE: The state of viral mimicry induced by epigenetic therapies in cancer cells remodels mitochondrial metabolism and drives caspase-independent tumor cell death, which sensitizes to BCL2 inhibitor drugs. This novel mechanism underlies clinical efficacy of hypomethylating agents and venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting similar combination therapies for other incurable cancers.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 995.","['Fresquet, Vicente', 'Garcia-Barchino, Maria J', 'Larrayoz, Marta', 'Celay, Jon', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'Fernandez-Galilea, Marta', 'Larrayoz, Maria J', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Panizo, Carlos', 'Junza, Alexandra', 'Han, Jiahuai', 'Prior, Celia', 'Fortes, Puri', 'Pio, Ruben', 'Oyarzabal, Julen', 'Martinez-Baztan, Alvaro', 'Paiva, Bruno', 'Moreno-Aliaga, Maria J', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Yanes, Oscar', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose A']","['Fresquet V', 'Garcia-Barchino MJ', 'Larrayoz M', 'Celay J', 'Vicente C', 'Fernandez-Galilea M', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Panizo C', 'Junza A', 'Han J', 'Prior C', 'Fortes P', 'Pio R', 'Oyarzabal J', 'Martinez-Baztan A', 'Paiva B', 'Moreno-Aliaga MJ', 'Odero MD', 'Agirre X', 'Yanes O', 'Prosper F', 'Martinez-Climent JA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6051-8475', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6097-8244', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2017-4206', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3363-3459', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6097-8244', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7205-0419', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7571-6220', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6831-6111', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1941-7255', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2018-6434', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8858-2054', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6115-8790']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201218,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,IM,,,2020/12/24 06:00,2020/12/24 06:00,['2020/12/23 08:40'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/23 08:40 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-20-1065 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1065 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2021 May;11(5):1268-1285. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1065.

We report a case of a 53-year-old African man who presented with fever and skin eruptions on the trunk composed of non-itchy erythematous reticulated macules and papules initially suspected for viral exanthem or drug rash. Skin punch biopsy showed a dermal T-cell lymphoid infiltrate with epidermotropism. The patient developed generalized lymphadenopathy and his peripheral blood showed lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclei. Our initial diagnosis was mycosis fungoides with Sezary syndrome. However, some clinical and histopathologic features were unusual. The acute onset, lack of previous skin lesions, the histomorphologic features of the dermal, nodal and peripheral blood lymphocytes and the geographic origin of the patient raised the suspicion of other T-cell lymphomas, particularly ATLL.

The deregulated expression of apoptosis-related genes and alteration in epigenetic machinery may also contribute to apoptosis resistance in CML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors target the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and are used in CML treatment. The resistance of CML patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors has guided the search for new compounds that may induce apoptosis in Bcr-Abl(+) leukemic cells and improve the disease treatment. Methods: In the present study, we investigated whether the L-amino acid oxidase isolated from Bothrops moojeni snake venom (BmooLAAO-I) (i) was cytotoxic to Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines (HL-60.Bcr-Abl, K562-S, and K562-R), HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) cells, the non-tumor cell line HEK-293, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); and (ii) affected epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and microRNAs expression in vitro. Results: BmooLAAO-I induced ROS production, apoptosis, and differential DNA methylation pattern of regulatory apoptosis genes. The toxin upregulated expression of the pro-apoptotic genes BID and FADD and downregulated DFFA expression in leukemic cell lines, as well as increased miR-16 expression - whose major predicted target is the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 - in Bcr-Abl(+) cells. Conclusion: BmooLAAO-I exerts selective antitumor action mediated by H2O2 release and induces apoptosis, and alterations in epigenetic mechanisms. These results support future investigations on the effect of BmooLAAO-I on in vivo models to determine its potential in CML therapy.","['Burin, Sandra Mara', 'Cacemiro, Maira da Costa', 'Cominal, Jucara Gastaldi', 'Grandis, Rone Aparecido De', 'Machado, Ana Rita Thomazela', 'Donaires, Flavia Sacilotto', 'Cintra, Adelia Cristina Oliveira', 'Ambrosio, Luciana', 'Antunes, Lusania Maria Greggi', 'Sampaio, Suely Vilela', 'de Castro, Fabiola Attie']","['Burin SM', 'Cacemiro MDC', 'Cominal JG', 'Grandis RA', 'Machado ART', 'Donaires FS', 'Cintra ACO', 'Ambrosio L', 'Antunes LMG', 'Sampaio SV', 'de Castro FA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4170-2063', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8872-338X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4326-9777', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3079-4388', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3274-180X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3347-5873']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201214,Brazil,J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis,The journal of venomous animals and toxins including tropical diseases,101201501,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BmooLAAO-I', 'Bothrops moojeni', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'MicroRNA', 'Snake toxins']",2020/12/24 06:00,2020/12/24 06:01,['2020/12/23 05:49'],"['2020/12/23 05:49 [entrez]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1590/1678-9199-JVATITD-2020-0123 [doi]'],epublish,J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis. 2020 Dec 14;26:e20200123. doi: 10.1590/1678-9199-JVATITD-2020-0123.,,,"['Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.']",,,['Competing interests: The authors report no conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7737401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various metabolic mechanisms orchestrate the behaviors of immune cells and leukemia cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. Furthermore, leukemia cells regulate the bone marrow microenvironment through metabolism to generate an adequate supply of energy and to escape antitumor immune surveillance. Thus, the targeting of the interaction between leukemia cells and the bone marrow microenvironment provides a new therapeutic avenue. In this review, we describe the concept of the bone marrow microenvironment and several important metabolic processes of leukemia cells within the bone marrow microenvironment, including carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. In addition, we discuss how these metabolic pathways regulate antitumor immunity and reveal potential therapeutic targets.","['Xu, Binyan', 'Hu, Rong', 'Liang, Zhao', 'Chen, Tong', 'Chen, Jianyu', 'Hu, Yuxing', 'Jiang, Yirong', 'Li, Yuhua']","['Xu B', 'Hu R', 'Liang Z', 'Chen T', 'Chen J', 'Hu Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Li Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201209,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow microenvironment', '*Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia', '*Metabolic regulation']",2020/12/24 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2020/12/23 05:36'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/23 05:36 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(20)30136-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2020.100786 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2021 Jul;48:100786. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2020.100786.

MCL-1 is a key factor in venetoclax resistance. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that MCL-1 regulates leukemia cell bioenergetics and carbohydrate metabolisms, including the TCA cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway and modulates cell adhesion proteins and leukemia-stromal interactions. Inhibition of MCL-1 sensitizes to BCL-2 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia cells and acute myeloid leukemia stem/progenitor cells, including those with intrinsic and acquired resistance to venetoclax through cooperative release of pro-apoptotic BIM, BAX, and BAK from binding to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins and inhibition of cell metabolism and key stromal microenvironmental mechanisms. The combined inhibition of MCL-1 by MCL-1 inhibitor AZD5991 or CDK9 inhibitor AZD4573 and BCL-2 by venetoclax greatly extended survival of mice bearing patient-derived xenografts established from an acute myeloid leukemia patient who acquired resistance to venetoclax/decitabine. These results demonstrate that co-targeting MCL-1 and BCL-2 improves the efficacy of and overcomes preexisting and acquired resistance to BCL-2 inhibition. Activation of metabolomic pathways and leukemia-stroma interactions are newly discovered functions of MCL-1 in acute myeloid leukemia, which are independent from canonical regulation of apoptosis by MCL-1. Our data provide new mechanisms of synergy and rationale for co-targeting MCL-1 and BCL-2 clinically in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and potentially other cancers.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Po Yee', 'Tao, Wenjing', 'Warmoes, Marc', 'Lorenzi, Philip L', 'Mak, Duncan', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Tan, Lin', 'Cidado, Justin', 'Drew, Lisa', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak PY', 'Tao W', 'Warmoes M', 'Lorenzi PL', 'Mak D', 'Ruvolo V', 'Tan L', 'Cidado J', 'Drew L', 'Andreeff M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20220101,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2020/12/24 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/12/23 03:16'],"['2020/12/23 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/23 03:16 [entrez]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.260331 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2022 Jan 1;107(1):58-76. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.260331.,20210527,,"['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. bicarter@mdanderson.org.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Bioscience Oncology RandD, AstraZeneca, Boston.', 'Bioscience Oncology RandD, AstraZeneca, Boston.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. mandreef@mdanderson.org.']","['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', '*Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8719086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While highly successful in various solid malignancies and in aggressive B-cell leukemia, this clinical success is often not matched in B-NHL. T-cell subset skewing, exhaustion, expansion of regulatory T-cell subsets, or other yet to be defined mechanisms may underlie the lack of efficacy of these treatment modalities. In this review, a systematic overview of results from clinical trials is given and is accompanied by reported data on T-cell dysfunction. From these results, we distill the underlying pathways that might be responsible for the observed differences in clinical responses towards autologous T-cell-based cellular immunotherapy modalities between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).

In contrast, the U.S. and many other nations are experiencing increasing prevalence in the absence of efforts to control transmission. Recent studies have shown that BLV infection in dairy cattle has a greater impact beyond the long-recognized lymphoma development that occurs in <5% of infected cattle. Like other retroviruses, BLV appears to cause multiple immune system disruptions, affecting both cellular and humoral immunity, which are likely responsible for increasingly documented associations with decreased dairy production and decreased productive lifespan. Realization of these economic losses has increased interest in controlling BLV using technology that was unavailable decades ago, when many nations eradicated BLV via traditional antibody testing and slaughter methods. This traditional control is not economically feasible for many nations where the average herd antibody prevalence is rapidly approaching 50%. The ELISA screening of cattle with follow-up testing via qPCR for proviral load helps prioritize the most infectious cattle for segregation or culling.

Treatment of Jurkat clones (JT/Neo) with BS-181 caused cytotoxicity and several apoptotic events, including TRAIL/DR4/DR5 upregulation, c-FLIP down-regulation, BID cleavage, BAK activation, DeltaPsim loss, caspase-8/9/3 activation, and PARP cleavage. However, the BCL-2-overexpressing Jurkat clone (JT/BCL-2) abrogated these apoptotic responses. CDK7 catalyzed the activating phosphorylation of CDK1 (Thr161) and CDK2 (Thr160), and CDK-directed retinoblastoma phosphorylation was attenuated in both BS-181-treated Jurkat clones, whereas only JT/BCL-2 cells exhibited G1 cell cycle arrest. The G1-blocker hydroxyurea augmented BS-181-induced apoptosis by enhancing TRAIL/DR4/DR5 upregulation and c-FLIP down-regulation. BS-181-induced FITC-annexin V-positive apoptotic cells were mostly in the sub-G1 and G1 phases. BS-181-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial apoptotic events (BAK activation/DeltaPsim loss/caspase-9 activation) in Jurkat clones I2.1 (FADD-deficient) and I9.2 (caspase-8-deficient) were significantly lower than in A3 (wild-type). Exogenously added recombinant TRAIL (rTRAIL) markedly synergized BS-181-induced apoptosis in A3 cells but not in normal peripheral T cells. The cotreatment cytotoxicity was significantly reduced by the DR5-blocking antibody but not by the DR4-blocking antibody. These results demonstrated that the BS-181 anti-leukemic activity is attributed to extrinsic TRAIL/DR5-dependent apoptosis preferentially induced in G1-arrested cells, and that BS-181 and rTRAIL in combination may hold promise for T-ALL treatment.","['Park, Shin Young', 'Kim, Ki Yun', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Hwang, Su-Kyeong', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Park SY', 'Kim KY', 'Jun DY', 'Hwang SK', 'Kim YH']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2909-7056', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8827-8311']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201219,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK inhibitor', 'DR5', 'G1 arrest', 'TRAIL', 'extrinsic apoptotic pathway', 'leukemia']",2020/12/24 06:00,2020/12/24 06:01,['2020/12/23 01:01'],"['2020/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123845 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123845 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 19;12(12). pii: cancers12123845. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123845.,,,"['Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences, BK21 FOUR KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences, BK21 FOUR KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.', 'Astrogen Inc., Techno-Building 313, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.', 'Astrogen Inc., Techno-Building 313, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences, BK21 FOUR KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.']",,,,,['2016R1A2B4016101/The National Research Foundation of Korea'],PMC7766600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription factors or chromatin modifiers are involved in orchestrating gene activity, such as the cohesin genes and their regulator NIPBL. In our previous studies, using a zebrafish model for nipblb knockdown, we described the effect of nipblb loss-of-function in specific contexts, such as central nervous system development and hematopoiesis. However, the genome-wide transcriptional impact of nipblb loss-of-function in zebrafish embryos at diverse developmental stages remains under investigation. By RNA-seq analyses in zebrafish embryos at 24 h post-fertilization, we examined genome-wide effects of nipblb knockdown on transcriptional programs. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that nipblb loss-of-function has an impact on gene expression at 24 h post fertilization, mainly resulting in gene inactivation. A similar transcriptional effect has also been reported in other organisms, supporting the use of zebrafish as a model to understand the role of Nipbl in gene regulation during early vertebrate development. Moreover, we unraveled a connection between nipblb-dependent differential expression and gene expression patterns of hematological cell populations and AML subtypes, enforcing our previous evidence on the involvement of NIPBL-related transcriptional dysregulation in hematological malignancies.","['Spreafico, Marco', 'Mangano, Eleonora', 'Mazzola, Mara', 'Consolandi, Clarissa', 'Bordoni, Roberta', 'Battaglia, Cristina', 'Bicciato, Silvio', 'Marozzi, Anna', 'Pistocchi, Anna']","['Spreafico M', 'Mangano E', 'Mazzola M', 'Consolandi C', 'Bordoni R', 'Battaglia C', 'Bicciato S', 'Marozzi A', 'Pistocchi A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6996-4033', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1944-7078', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9467-2542']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201219,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['NIPBL', 'RNA sequencing', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene expression regulation', 'zebrafish']",2020/12/24 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/12/23 01:01'],"['2020/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249719 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249719 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 19;21(24). pii: ijms21249719. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249719.,20210401,,"['Department of Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Via Fratelli Cervi 93, Segrate, 20090 Milano, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, Italian National Research Council (ITB-CNR), Via Fratelli Cervi 93, Segrate, 20090 Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Via Fratelli Cervi 93, Segrate, 20090 Milano, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, Italian National Research Council (ITB-CNR), Via Fratelli Cervi 93, Segrate, 20090 Milano, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, Italian National Research Council (ITB-CNR), Via Fratelli Cervi 93, Segrate, 20090 Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, LITA, Via Fratelli Cervi 93, Segrate, 20090 Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio-Emilia, Via G.

The AML blasts display features of antigen-presenting cells (APC), and thus can directly modulate the anti-tumour T cell responses. The bone marrow of a group consisting of 30 newly diagnosed patients and four healthy donors (HD) was investigated for the expression of HLA-DR, several molecules involved in MHC-II antigen-presentation and MHC-II groove editing, like HLA-DM, CD74 and CLIP, as well as a set of immune checkpoint ligands, like ICOS-L, B7.2, PD-L2 and B7-H3. The patients were further characterised for their genetic anomalies and distributed to favourable, intermediate and adverse ELN risk categories. We were able to show that while 23% of our patients displayed a low level of HLA-DR surface expression, all patients displayed higher HLA-DM and CD74 expression compared to HD. However, a higher CLIP expression was noticed only in the HLA-DR low patients. The co-inhibitory PD-L2 and B7-H3 molecules were increased in the cases with normal HLA-DR expression; oppositely, the co-stimulatory ICOS-L and the dual function B7.2 were significantly increased in the cases with HLA-DR low expression. Furthermore, no favourable ELN risk cases were found within the HLA-DR low group. All in all, these data show that the AML with low versus normal HLA-DR expression display different profiles of MHC class II machinery molecules and B7 ligands, which are correlated with distinct ELN stratification. Furthermore, as our study included healthy individuals, it offers valuable information about the expression levels that should be considered as normal for these markers known to cause differences in peptide repertoires, reflected further in distinct T-cells polarisation pathways.","['Antohe, Ion', 'Tanasa, Mariana Pavel', 'Dascalescu, Angela', 'Danaila, Catalin', 'Titieanu, Amalia', 'Zlei, Mihaela', 'Ivanov, Iuliu', 'Sireteanu, Adriana', 'Cianga, Petru']","['Antohe I', 'Tanasa MP', 'Dascalescu A', 'Danaila C', 'Titieanu A', 'Zlei M', 'Ivanov I', 'Sireteanu A', 'Cianga P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201203,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Antigen-presentation', '*HLA', '*HLA-DM', '*Immunotherapy', '*Invariant chain']",2020/12/23 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/12/22 20:10'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 20:10 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(20)30571-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2020.152049 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2021 Jan;226(1):152049. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2020.152049.

DNA methylation profiling is an essential facet to understanding malignant transformation and is becoming an increasingly important tool for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring. In this review, the role of DNA methylation in normal cellular function is discussed, as well as how epigenetic aberrations override normal cellular cues that lead to tumor initiation and propagation.

Thus, this review focuses on the recent accomplishments of baicalin and its limitations in cancer prevention and treatment. Further, combination studies and nanoformulations using baicalin to treat cancer along with the metabolism, bioavailability, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics have been discussed. The present review explains biological source, and anti-proliferative potential of baicalin against cancers including breast, colon, hepatic, leukemia, lung, and skin, as well as the relevant mechanism of action to modulate diverse signaling pathways including apoptosis, cell cycle, invasion, and migration, angiogenesis, and autophagy. The anticancer mechanism of baicalin in orthotropic and xenograft mice models have been deliberated. The combination studies of baicalin in novel therapies as chemotherapeutic adjuvants have also been summarized. The low bioavailability, fast metabolism, and poor solubility, and other significant factors that limit the clinical use of baicalin have been examined as a challenge. The improvement in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of baicalin with newer approaches and the gaps are highlighted, which could establish baicalin as an effective and safe compound for cancer treatment as well as help to translate its potential from bench to bedside.","['Singh, Shilpi', 'Meena, Abha', 'Luqman, Suaib']","['Singh S', 'Meena A', 'Luqman S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201219,Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Angiogenesis', '*Anticancer', '*Antiproliferative', '*Apoptosis', '*Baicalin', '*Pharmacokinetics']",2020/12/23 06:00,2022/01/06 06:00,['2020/12/22 20:08'],"['2020/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 20:08 [entrez]']","['S1043-6618(20)31695-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105387 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2021 Feb;164:105387. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105387.

Recurrent somatic mutations in the cohesin complex are frequent genetic drivers in cancer, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, using genetic dependency screens of stromal antigen 2-mutant (STAG2-mutant) AML, we identified DNA damage repair and replication as genetic dependencies in cohesin-mutant cells. We demonstrated increased levels of DNA damage and sensitivity of cohesin-mutant cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition. We developed a mouse model of MDS in which Stag2 mutations arose as clonal secondary lesions in the background of clonal hematopoiesis driven by tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2) mutations and demonstrated selective depletion of cohesin-mutant cells with PARP inhibition in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated a shift from STAG2- to STAG1-containing cohesin complexes in cohesin-mutant cells, which was associated with longer DNA loop extrusion, more intermixing of chromatin compartments, and increased interaction with PARP and replication protein A complex. Our findings inform the biology and therapeutic opportunities for cohesin-mutant malignancies.","['Tothova, Zuzana', 'Valton, Anne-Laure', 'Gorelov, Rebecca A', 'Vallurupalli, Mounica', 'Krill-Burger,

ATRA forces APL cells into differentiation and cell death. Unfortunately, ATRA-based therapy has not been effective among any other acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtype, and long-term survival rates remain unacceptably low; only 30% of AML patients survive 5 years after diagnosis. Here, we identified insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) as part of ATRA-induced responses in APL cells. Most importantly, we observed that addition of recombinant human IGFBP7 (rhIGFBP7) increased ATRA-driven responses in a subset of non-APL AML samples: those with high RARA expression. In nonpromyelocytic AML, rhIGFBP7 treatment induced a transcriptional program that sensitized AML cells for ATRA-induced differentiation, cell death, and inhibition of leukemic stem/progenitor cell survival. Furthermore, the engraftment of primary AML in mice was significantly reduced following treatment with the combination of rhIGFBP7 and ATRA. Mechanistically, we showed that the synergism of ATRA and rhIGFBP7 is due, at least in part, to reduction of the transcription factor GFI1. Together, these results suggest a potential clinical utility of IGFBP7 and ATRA combination treatment to eliminate primary AML (leukemic stem/progenitor) cells and reduce relapse in AML patients.","['van Gils, Noortje', 'Verhagen, Han J M P', 'Rutten, Arjo', 'Menezes, Renee X', 'Tsui, Mei-Ling', 'Vermue, Eline', 'Dekens, Esmee', 'Brocco, Fabio', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'Kessler, Floortje L', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Smit, Linda']","['van Gils N', 'Verhagen HJMP', 'Rutten A', 'Menezes RX', 'Tsui ML', 'Vermue E', 'Dekens E', 'Brocco F', 'Denkers F', 'Kessler FL', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Smit L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/12/22 12:37'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 12:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)32062-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002812 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 22;4(24):6368-6383. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002812.,20210519,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.']","['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mice', '*Retinoids', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,,PMC7756998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite sharing a common pathogenic mechanism involving rearrangements of the CBF transcriptional complex, there is growing evidence for considerable genotypic heterogeneity. We comprehensively characterized the mutational landscape of 350 adult CBF-AML [inv(16): n = 160, t(8;21): n = 190] performing targeted sequencing of 230 myeloid cancer-associated genes. Apart from common mutations in signaling genes, mainly NRAS, KIT, and FLT3, both CBF-AML entities demonstrated a remarkably diverse pattern with respect to the underlying cooperating molecular events, in particular in genes encoding for epigenetic modifiers and the cohesin complex. In addition, recurrent mutations in novel collaborating candidate genes such as SRCAP (5% overall) and DNM2 (6% of t(8;21) AML) were identified. Moreover, aberrations altering transcription and differentiation occurred at earlier leukemic stages and preceded mutations impairing proliferation. Lasso-penalized models revealed an inferior prognosis for t(8;21) AML, trisomy 8, as well as FLT3 and KIT exon 17 mutations, whereas NRAS and WT1 mutations conferred superior prognosis. Interestingly, clonal heterogeneity was associated with a favorable prognosis. When entering mutations by functional groups in the model, mutations in genes of the methylation group (ie, DNMT3A, TET2) had a strong negative prognostic impact.","['Jahn, Nikolaus', 'Terzer, Tobias', 'Strang, Eric', 'Dolnik, Anna', 'Cocciardi, Sibylle', 'Panina, Ekaterina', 'Corbacioglu, Andrea', 'Herzig, Julia', 'Weber, Daniela', 'Schrade, Anika', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Schroder, Thomas', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Wellnitz, Dominique', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Rucker, Frank G', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Benner, Axel', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Jahn N', 'Terzer T', 'Strang E', 'Dolnik A', 'Cocciardi S', 'Panina E', 'Corbacioglu A', 'Herzig J', 'Weber D', 'Schrade A', 'Gotze K', 'Schroder T', 'Lubbert M', 'Wellnitz D', 'Koller E', 'Schlenk RF', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Paschka P', 'Rucker FG', 'Heuser M', 'Thol F', 'Ganser A', 'Benner A', 'Dohner H', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/12/22 12:37'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 12:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)32054-1 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002673 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 22;4(24):6342-6352. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002673.,20210519,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Tumor Immunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Tumor Immunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hanuschkrankenhaus Wien, Wien, Austria.', 'National Center of Tumor Diseases-Trial Center, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Tumor Immunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['0 (Core Binding Factors)'],"['Adult', '*Core Binding Factors/genetics', 'Genomics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",,,,PMC7757000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective analysis from the EBMT.,6283-6290,10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003418 [doi],"We performed a study to find out how advances in modern medicine have improved the mortality risk of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We analyzed major transplantation outcome parameters in adult patients on the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry who had hematologic malignancies and had received transplants from matched sibling donors. We performed multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional-hazards model including known risk factors for nonrelapse mortality and a matched-pairs analysis. We identified 38 800 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Considerable changes in patient characteristics have occurred in the past decades, such as older age, different underlying diseases, and a higher proportion of patients with advanced disease. Major reasons for transplantation-related death in the 1980s were infectious complications and graft-versus-host disease. Nonrelapse mortality, measured at 1 year after transplantation, has decreased over time: 29.7% from 1980 through 1989, 24.4% from 1990 through 1999, 14.8% from 2000 through 2009, and 12.2% from 2010 through 2016. On multivariate analysis, the year of transplantation was associated with reduced nonrelapse mortality (P < .0001; hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.8 [0.79-0.82], for 5-year intervals) and decreased overall mortality (P < .0001; HR [95% CI], 0.87 [0.86-0.88]. In the matched-pairs analysis of 3718 patients in each group, nonrelapse mortality at 1 year was 24.4% in the 1990s and 9.5% from 2013 through 2016 (P < .0001; HR [95% CI], 0.39 [0.34-0.43]).

Oncogenic signaling induces oncogene-induced senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is characterized by enhanced production of various cytokines. BCR-ABL gene transduction confers senescent phenotype in vitro; however, the in vivo relevance of senescence has not been explored in this context. Transplantation of BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells caused CML in mice with an increase in bone marrow BCR-ABL+CD41+CD150+ leukemic megakaryocyte-lineage (MgkL) cells, which exhibited enhanced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and increased expression of p16 and p21, key molecules that are crucially involved in senescence. Moreover, knockout of p16 and p21 genes reduced both BCR-ABL-induced abnormal megakaryopoiesis and the maintenance of CML cell leukemogenic capacity, as evidenced by attenuated leukemogenic capacity at secondary transplantation. The expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), a representative SASP molecule, was enhanced in the leukemic MgkL cells, and TGF-beta1 inhibition attenuated CML cell leukemogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, BCR-ABL-expressing MgkL cells displayed enhanced autophagic activity, and autophagy inhibition reduced bone marrow MgkL cell number and prolonged the survival of CML mice, which had transiently received the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, earlier. Thus, BCR-ABL induced the expansion of senescent leukemic MgkL cells, which supported CML leukemogenesis by providing TGF-beta1.","['Tanabe, Yamato', 'Kawamoto, Shimpei', 'Takaku, Tomoiku', 'Morishita, Soji', 'Hirao, Atsushi', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Hara, Eiji', 'Mukaida, Naofumi', 'Baba, Tomohisa']","['Tanabe Y', 'Kawamoto S', 'Takaku T', 'Morishita S', 'Hirao A', 'Komatsu N', 'Hara E', 'Mukaida N', 'Baba T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/12/22 12:37'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 12:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31891-7 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003117 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 22;4(24):6175-6188. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003117.,20210519,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Stem Cell Regulation, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and.', 'Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.']","['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Animals', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*Megakaryocytes', 'Mice']",,,,PMC7757005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed 141 patients with relapsed/refractory AML who received first salvage therapy and had MRD assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry at the time of response. Patients who achieved CR with full hematologic recovery as best response vs those with incomplete hematology recovery had lower cumulative incidence of relapse (P = .01) and better relapse-free survival (P = .004) but not overall survival (P = .15); a similar trend was observed in patients who achieved MRD negativity vs those who were MRD positive (P = .01, P = .05, and P = .21, respectively). By multivariate analysis, CR and MRD negativity were each independently associated with lower cumulative incidence of relapse (P = .001 and P = .003, respectively) and better relapse-free survival (P < .001 and P = .02) but not overall survival. Patients who achieved CR with MRD negativity had the lowest rates of relapse and best survival (2-year overall survival rate, 37%), which was driven largely by lower rates of early relapse and an increased ability in this group to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); however, post-HSCT outcomes were similar regardless of response to salvage chemotherapy. Overall, in patients with relapsed/refractory AML, CR with MRD negativity was associated with the best outcomes, supporting it as the optimal response in this setting.","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Rafei, Hind', 'Daver, Naval', 'Hwang, Hyunsoo', 'Ning, Jing', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Popat, Uday', 'Oran, Betul', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Issa, Ghayas C', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Short NJ', 'Rafei H', 'Daver N', 'Hwang H', 'Ning J', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Kadia TM', 'DiNardo CD', 'Wang SA', 'Jabbour E', 'Popat U', 'Oran B', 'Cortes J', 'Konopleva M', 'Yilmaz M', 'Issa GC', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2020/12/22 12:37'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 12:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31880-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002811 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 22;4(24):6117-6126. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002811.,20210512,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Department of Leukemia.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Biostatistics.', 'Department of Biostatistics.', 'Department of Hematopathology, and.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Hematopathology, and.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.']",,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR003167/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7757010,,,,,,,['Blood Adv. 2021 Jan 26;5(2):366.

The tyrosine kinase Lyn is a key modulator of BCR signaling and shows increased expression and activity in CLL. To evaluate the functional relevance of Lyn for CLL, we generated a conditional knockin mouse model harboring a gain-of-function mutation of the Lyn gene (LynY508F), which was specifically expressed in the B-cell lineage (Lynup-B). Kinase activity profiling revealed an enhanced responsiveness to BCR stimulation in Lynup-B B cells. When crossing Lynup-B mice with Emicro-TCL1 mice (TCL1tg/wt), a transgenic mouse model for CLL, the resulting TCL1tg/wt Lynup-B mice showed no significant change of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration, or overall survival when compared with TCL1tg/wt mice. Our data also suggested that TCL1 expression has partially masked the effect of the Lynup-B mutation, because the BCR response was only slightly increased in TCL1tg/wt Lynup-B compared with TCL1tg/wt. In contrast, TCL1tg/wt Lynup-B were protected at various degrees against spontaneous apoptosis in vitro and upon treatment with kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR. Collectively, and consistent with our previous data in a Lyn-deficient CLL model, these data lend further suggest that an increased activation of Lyn kinase in B cells does not appear to be a major driver of leukemia progression and the level of increased BCR responsiveness induced by Lynup-B is insufficient to induce clear changes to CLL pathogenesis in vivo.","['Kohlhas, Viktoria', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Nguyen, Phuong-Hien']","['Kohlhas V', 'Hallek M', 'Nguyen PH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/12/22 12:37'],"['2020/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 12:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31878-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002584 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 22;4(24):6106-6116. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002584.,20210519,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']","['Animals', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,PMC7756995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the validity of the IWG 2006 response criteria in a large cohort of higher-risk MDS patients (pts) treated at centers from the MDS Clinical Research Consortium. The best overall response rate (ORR) by IWG 2006 criteria to first-line therapy among 597 evaluable pts was 38% and include complete response (CR) 16%, marrow CR (mCR) 2%, partial response (PR) 10%, hematological improvement (HI) 10%, stable disease (SD) 33%, and progressive disease (PD) 24%. CR was associated with a better overall survival (OS) compared to all other response groups (P < 0.001). Among 470 pts treated with hypomethylating agent (HMA) as first-line therapy, the overall Response Rate, defined as HI or better was 39%. The median OS from time of best response was 21 mo, 8 mo, 14 mo, 12 mo, 13 mo, and 8 mo for CR, mCR, PR, HI, SD, and PD, respectively (P < 0.001). We validated those results in a separate cohort of 539 higher-risk MDS pts treated at Moffitt Cancer Center who received first-line HMA therapy, particularly addressing the value of mCR and mCR+HI. mCR alone without HI, SD, and PD outcomes were inferior to CR, PR, mCR+HI, and HI. In conclusion, CR by IWG 2006 response criteria can be used as a surrogate endpoint for OS in higher-risk MDS pts. Any response associated with restoration of effective hematopoiesis is associated with better outcome.","['Komrokji, Rami S', 'Al Ali, Najla H', 'Sallman, David', 'Padron, Eric', 'DeZern, Amy E', 'Barnard, John', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'List, Alan', 'Steensma, David P', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Komrokji RS', 'Al Ali NH', 'Sallman D', 'Padron E', 'DeZern AE', 'Barnard J', 'Roboz GJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'List A', 'Steensma DP', 'Sekeres MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1876-5269', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0504-8233']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20201222,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*high-risk disease', '*international working group', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*response criteria']",2020/12/23 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/12/22 05:52'],"['2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 05:52 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3608 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2021 Jan;10(2):447-453. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3608.

We aimed to evaluate the outcomes and prognostic factors of the second HSCT (HSCT2) in acute leukemia patients relapsed after the first HSCT (HSCT1). We analyzed 80 patients who received HSCT2 for relapsed acute leukemia in two Korean institutes. All but four patients received HSCT2 from a donor other than matched sibling donor: an unrelated donor (URD) in 30 and a familial haploidentical donor (FHD) in 46. Forty-four patients (55.0%) were in complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) at HSCT2, and the median time from HSCT1 to relapse was 9 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 21.0% and 17.5%, respectively. The outcomes were similar between URD and FHD. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that disease status (active disease vs. CR/CRi) at HSCT2 and remission duration after HSCT1 were independent prognostic factors for OS and EFS after HSCT2. HSCT2 from URD or FHD was feasible in patients with acute leukemia relapsed after allogeneic HSCT. Also, our study confirmed two critical prognostic factors; disease status at HSCT2 and remission duration after HSCT1.","['Choi, Yunsuk', 'Choi, Eun-Ji', 'Lee, Jung-Hee', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Jo, Jae-Cheol', 'Park, Han-Seung', 'Lee, Yoo Jin', 'Seol, Miee', 'Lee, Young-Shin', 'Kang, Young-Ah', 'Jeon, Mijin', 'Lee, Je-Hwan']","['Choi Y', 'Choi EJ', 'Lee JH', 'Lee KH', 'Jo JC', 'Park HS', 'Lee YJ', 'Seol M', 'Lee YS', 'Kang YA', 'Jeon M', 'Lee JH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7983-8089'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210103,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute', '*leukemia', '*outcomes', '*prognostic factors', '*relapse', '*second allogeneic stem cell transplantation']",2020/12/23 06:00,2021/07/02 06:00,['2020/12/22 05:48'],"['2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 05:48 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ctr.14199 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2021 Mar;35(3):e14199. doi: 10.1111/ctr.14199.

While SF3B1 mutations are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, SRSF2(P95) mutations are found in different disease categories, including MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify molecular determinants of this phenotypic heterogeneity, we explored molecular and clinical features of a prospective cohort of 279 SRSF2(P95)-mutated cases selected from a population of 2663 patients with myeloid neoplasms. Median number of somatic mutations per subject was 3. Multivariate regression analysis showed associations between co-mutated genes and clinical phenotype, including JAK2 or MPL with myelofibrosis (OR = 26.9); TET2 with monocytosis (OR = 5.2); RAS-pathway genes with leukocytosis (OR = 5.1); and STAG2, RUNX1, or IDH1/2 with blast phenotype (MDS or AML) (OR = 3.4, 1.9, and 2.1, respectively). Within patients with SRSF2-JAK2 co-mutation, JAK2 dominance was invariably associated with clinical feature of MPN, whereas SRSF2 mutation was dominant in MDS/MPN. Within patients with SRSF2-TET2 co-mutation, clinical expressivity of monocytosis was positively associated with co-mutated clone size. This study provides evidence that co-mutation pattern, clone size, and hierarchy concur to determine clinical phenotype, tracing relevant genotype-phenotype associations across disease entities and giving insight on unaccountable clinical heterogeneity within current WHO classification categories.","['Todisco, Gabriele', 'Creignou, Maria', 'Galli, Anna', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Roncador, Marco', 'Rizzo, Ettore', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Pietra, Daniela', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Bono, Elisa', 'Molteni, Elisabetta', 'Rosti, Vittorio', 'Catricala, Silvia', 'Sarchi, Martina', 'Dimitriou, Marios', 'Ungerstedt, Johanna', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Malcovati, Luca']","['Todisco G', 'Creignou M', 'Galli A', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Rumi E', 'Roncador M', 'Rizzo E', 'Nannya Y', 'Pietra D', 'Elena C', 'Bono E', 'Molteni E', 'Rosti V', 'Catricala S', 'Sarchi M', 'Dimitriou M', 'Ungerstedt J', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Ogawa S', 'Cazzola M', 'Malcovati L']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6583-3829', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4039-3756', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1809-284X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7572-9504', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6575-8766', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8362-2099', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7778-5374', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6984-8817', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1460-1611']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201221,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2020/12/22 05:43'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 05:43 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01106-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01106-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Aug;35(8):2371-2381. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01106-z.

Here we identify the histone methyltransferase Mll1 as a regulator of Wnt-driven intestinal cancer. Mll1 is highly expressed in Lgr5(+) stem cells and human colon carcinomas with increased nuclear beta-catenin. High levels of MLL1 are associated with poor survival of colon cancer patients. The genetic ablation of Mll1 in mice prevents Wnt/beta-catenin-driven adenoma formation from Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells. Ablation of Mll1 decreases the self-renewal of human colon cancer spheres and halts tumor growth of xenografts. Mll1 controls the expression of stem cell genes including the Wnt/beta-catenin target gene Lgr5. Upon the loss of Mll1, histone methylation at the stem cell promoters switches from activating H3K4 tri-methylation to repressive H3K27 tri-methylation, indicating that Mll1 sustains stem cell gene expression by antagonizing gene silencing through polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation. Transcriptome profiling of Wnt-mutated intestinal tumor-initiating cells reveals that Mll1 regulates Gata4/6 transcription factors, known to sustain cancer stemness and to control goblet cell differentiation. Our results demonstrate that Mll1 is an essential epigenetic regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin-induced intestinal tumorigenesis and cancer stemness.","['Grinat, Johanna', 'Heuberger, Julian', 'Vidal, Ramon Oliveira', 'Goveas, Neha', 'Kosel, Frauke', 'Berenguer-Llergo, Antoni', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Wulf-Goldenberg, Annika', 'Behrens, Diana', 'Melcher, Balint', 'Sauer, Sascha', 'Vieth, Michael', 'Batlle, Eduard', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Birchmeier, Walter']","['Grinat J', 'Heuberger J', 'Vidal RO', 'Goveas N', 'Kosel F', 'Berenguer-Llergo A', 'Kranz A', 'Wulf-Goldenberg A', 'Behrens D', 'Melcher B', 'Sauer S', 'Vieth M', 'Batlle E', 'Stewart AF', 'Birchmeier W']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0152-4941', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7205-732X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4217-2014', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2531-5514', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3742-8161', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4794-3693', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1173-0829']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201221,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,IM,,,2020/12/23 06:00,2021/01/16 06:00,['2020/12/22 05:41'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-20222-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-20222-z [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 21;11(1):6422. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20222-z.,20210115,,"['Cancer Research Program, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in the Helmholtz Society, 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Cancer Research Program, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in the Helmholtz Society, 13125, Berlin, Germany. julian.heuberger@charite.de.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical Department, Charite University Medicine, 13353, Berlin, Germany. julian.heuberger@charite.de.', 'Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Nutrigenomics and Systems Biology, Scientific Genomics Platforms, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (BIMSB/BIH), 13092, Berlin, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Cancer Research Program, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in the Helmholtz Society, 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit, Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Experimental Pharmacology & Oncology (EPO), 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental Pharmacology & Oncology (EPO), 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, Klinikum Bayreuth, 95445, Bayreuth, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Nutrigenomics and Systems Biology, Scientific Genomics Platforms, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (BIMSB/BIH), 13092, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, Klinikum Bayreuth, 95445, Bayreuth, Germany.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'ICREA, Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Cancer Research Program, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in the Helmholtz Society, 13125, Berlin, Germany. wbirch@mdc-berlin.de.']","['0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (LGR5 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']","['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestines/pathology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,,PMC7752919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elderly patients have more chemoresistant disease, and this is partly due to decreased frequencies of favorable and increased frequencies of adverse genetic abnormalities. However, aging-dependent differences may also contribute. We therefore compared AML cell proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles for (i) elderly low-risk and younger low-risk patients with favorable genetic abnormalities; and (ii) high-risk patients with adverse genetic abnormalities and a higher median age against all low-risk patients with lower median age. Elderly low-risk and younger low-risk patients showed mainly phosphoproteomic differences especially involving transcriptional regulators and cytoskeleton. When comparing high-risk and low-risk patients both proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies showed differences involving cytoskeleton and immunoregulation but also transcriptional regulation and cell division. The age-associated prognostic impact of cyclin-dependent kinases was dependent on the cellular context. The protein level of the adverse prognostic biomarker mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) showed a similar significant upregulation both in elderly low-risk and elderly high-risk patients. Our results suggest that molecular mechanisms associated with cellular aging influence chemoresistance of AML cells, and especially the cytoskeleton function may then influence cellular hallmarks of aging, e.g. mitosis, polarity, intracellular transport and adhesion.","['Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Berven, Frode', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Aasebo E', 'Berven F', 'Selheim F', 'Bruserud O']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201220,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALDH2', '*acute myeloid leukenia', '*age', '*cytogenetics', '*risk']",2020/12/23 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2020/12/22 05:40'],"['2020/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 05:40 [entrez]']","['202361 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.202361 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Dec 20;12(24):24734-24777. doi: 10.18632/aging.202361.

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of EPO levels and JAK2-V617F mutation, we constructed a receiver-operated characteristic curve of sensitivity versus 1-specificity for serum EPO levels and JAK2-V617F mutation as predictive markers for differentiating PV from other causes of erythrocytosis. RESULTS: We surveyed 577 patients with erythrocytosis. Median patient age was 59.2 years, 57.72% (n = 329) were male, 86.3% (n = 491) were white, and only 3.3% (n = 19) were African American. A total of 80.88% (n = 351) of those diagnosed with PV had a JAK2-V617F mutation compared to only 1.47% (n = 2) whose primary diagnosis was secondary polycythemia. When comparing JAK2-V617 mutation to the EPO level, the area under the curve of JAK2-V617 (0.8970) was statistically larger than that of EPO test (0.6765). Therefore, the PV diagnostic methodology using JAK2-V617 is better than the EPO test. An EPO level of < 2 mIU/mL was > 99% specific to predict PV but was only 12% sensitive. CONCLUSION: In the appropriate clinical setting, cytogenetic and molecular studies such as JAK2 mutation status prevail as the most useful tools for PV case identification. The use of isolated EPO to screen patients with erythrocytosis is not a good diagnostic approach.","['Davila-Gonzalez, Daniel', 'Barrios-Ruiz, Alanna', 'Fountain, Eric', 'Cheng, Lee', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Rojas-Hernandez, Cristhiam M']","['Davila-Gonzalez D', 'Barrios-Ruiz A', 'Fountain E', 'Cheng L', 'Masarova L', 'Verstovsek S', 'Rojas-Hernandez CM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201105,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Diagnosis', '*Erythrocytosis', '*Erythropoietin', '*JAK2-V617F', '*Polycythemia']",2020/12/23 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2020/12/22 05:40'],"['2020/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/22 05:40 [entrez]']","['S2152-2650(20)30615-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2020.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2021 Apr;21(4):224-229. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2020.11.002.

PBML has been a rare presentation of malignant lymphoma, and most of the cases have a poor prognosis and require rapid diagnoses and treatments. Among all PBMLs, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common pathological subtype. Over 25 years and from 7 institutions, the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group retrospectively collected PBML cases and, in 2012, published these 21 cases, including 19 cases of B-cell lymphoma and 2 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Among the B-cell types, DLBCL accounted for 79% and follicular lymphoma (FL) for 21%. DLBCLs were characterized by the existence of large cells. In this article, we present a rare case of high-grade aggressive type with P53 mutation, intermediate-sized B-cell lymphoma, excluded FL by the absence of FL lymphoma markers, presented as PBML. Our patient had rapid progression and succumbed to the disease shortly after diagnosis. Upon literature review, 62 B-cell lymphoma cases were identified that presented as PBML (51 high-grade and 11 low-grade)-mostly case reports. Among these, only one case was reported as intermediate-sized DLBCL-like lymphoma but not with aggressive features. Our case represents the first case of aggressive intermediate-sized lymphoma, not a FL, with P53 mutation, highly elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and Ki-67 presented as PBML. Such a profile would need to be quickly recognized and aggressive treatment applied, such as CART (chimeric antigen receptor T-cells) therapy or DA-EPOCH-R (dose-adjusted EPOCH [etoposide-prednisone-oncovin-cyclophosphamide-hydroxydaunorubicin] and rituximab) with or without venetoclax.","['Chen, Pei Ting', 'Jorsan, Karan', 'Avezbakiyev, Boris', 'Akhtar, Cheema', 'Wang, Jen Chin']","['Chen PT', 'Jorsan K', 'Avezbakiyev B', 'Akhtar C', 'Wang JC']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9623-6645'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,101624758,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*P53 mutation', '*PBML', '*cytopenia', '*primary bone marrow lymphoma']",2020/12/23 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2020/12/22 05:31'],"['2020/12/22 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/2324709620982765 [doi]'],ppublish,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep. 2020 Jan-Dec;8:2324709620982765. doi: 10.1177/2324709620982765.,20211015,,"['Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.', 'Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.']",['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/therapeutic use']",,,,PMC7758647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long non-coding RNAs have recently emerged as promising disease-specific biomarkers for the clinic. Here, we identified pediatric B-ALL-specific lncRNAs and associated mRNAs by comparing the transcriptomic signatures of tumoral and non-tumoral samples. We identified 48 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed between pediatric B-ALL and healthy bone marrow samples. The most relevant lncRNA/mRNA pair was AL133346.1/CCN2 (previously known as RP11-69I8.3/CTGF), whose expression was positively correlated and increased in B-ALL samples. Their differential expression pattern and their strong correlation were validated in external B-ALL datasets (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia). Survival curve analysis demonstrated that patients with ""high"" expression levels of CCN2 had higher overall survival than those with ""low"" levels (p = 0.042), and this gene might be an independent prognostic biomarker in pediatric B-ALL. These findings provide one of the first detailed descriptions of lncRNA expression profiles in pediatric B-ALL and indicate that these potential biomarkers could help in the classification of leukemia subtypes and that CCN2 expression could predict the survival outcome of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.","['Cuadros, Marta', 'Garcia, Daniel J', 'Andrades, Alvaro', 'Arenas, Alberto M', 'Coira, Isabel F', 'Balinas-Gavira, Carlos', 'Peinado, Paola', 'Rodriguez, Maria I', 'Alvarez-Perez, Juan Carlos', 'Ruiz-Cabello, Francisco', 'Camos, Mireia', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Medina, Pedro P']","['Cuadros M', 'Garcia DJ', 'Andrades A', 'Arenas AM', 'Coira IF', 'Balinas-Gavira C', 'Peinado P', 'Rodriguez MI', 'Alvarez-Perez JC', 'Ruiz-Cabello F', 'Camos M', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Medina PP']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5611-534X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9042-8964', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5995-2968', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3368-4691', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6396-311X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2247-3293', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7834-7093']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201217,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['AL133346.1', 'CCN2', 'CTGF', 'biomarker', 'lncRNA expression', 'pediatric B-ALL']",2020/12/23 06:00,2020/12/23 06:01,['2020/12/22 01:03'],"['2020/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123803 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123803 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 17;12(12). pii: cancers12123803. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123803.,,,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology III and Immunology, University of Granada, Av. de la Investigacion 11, 18016 Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer/University of Granada/Andalusian Regional Government, Av. de la Ilustracion 114, 18016 Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria (ibs.

A recent ""two-hit"" model for the occurrence of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia propose that this disease arises through a two-step process, including predisposing genetic mutation and exposure to infections. While several genetic mutations are proposed, no infection category has been suggested. We have isolated a certain Aspergillus Flavus from residence of an ALL patient. This organism contains mycovirus and does not produce aflatoxin. The supernatant of culture of this mycovirus containing Aspergillus Flavus (SAF) was tested on the PBMCs of ALL patients in remission and controls. Cell surface phenotypes and genetic markers were examined. The effects of its combination with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was also investigated. For the SAF, positive and negative controls were aflatoxin and culture of Mycocladus corymbifer, respectively. Controls for ALL were sickle cell patients undergoing exchange transfusion. Incubation of the PMBCs from ALL patients in remission, or controls, with SAF resulted in re-development of ALL cell surface phenotypes and genetic markers in ALL patients in remission and not controls. These differentiating effects were not seen with aflatoxin or culture of Mycocladus Corymbifer. Addition of EBV did not alter effects of SAF. Currently, there are no techniques to discriminately reproduce characteristic leukemic genetic markers and cell surface phenotypes in cells from ALL patients in remission and not controls. These studies may provide a test for recognition of ALL patients in remission and new prospects for the investigation of leukemogenesis.","['Tebbi, Cameron K', 'Badiga, Aruna', 'Sahakian, Eva', 'Powers, John J', 'Achille, Alex N', 'Patel, Saumil', 'Migone, Felicia']","['Tebbi CK', 'Badiga A', 'Sahakian E', 'Powers JJ', 'Achille AN', 'Patel S', 'Migone F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20201211,England,Cancer Treat Res Commun,Cancer treatment and research communications,101694651,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Aspergillus flavus', '*Cell surface phenotype', '*Genetics', '*Leukemogenesis', '*Mycovirus']",2020/12/22 06:00,2022/01/01 06:00,['2020/12/21 20:16'],"['2020/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 20:16 [entrez]']","['S2468-2942(20)30114-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctarc.2020.100279 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Res Commun. 2021;26:100279. doi: 10.1016/j.ctarc.2020.100279.

However, some concerns have emerged regarding rare and delayed adverse events including cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia, for which data are scarce. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia related to PARP inhibitors, via a systematic review and safety meta-analysis, and to describe clinical features of PARP inhibitor-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia cases reported in WHO's pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase). METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PARP inhibitor therapy versus control treatments (placebo and non-placebo) in adults (age >/=18 years) treated for cancer in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry with ongoing surveillance up to May 31, 2020. The date range for included studies was not restricted. By a stepwise method to capture all available adverse events, we first extracted data on myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia cases from ClinicalTrials.gov. If cases were not available, we extracted them from published manuscripts, or subsequently contacted corresponding authors or sponsors to provide data. RCTs without available data from ClinicalTrials.gov, publications, or corresponding authors or sponsors were excluded. The primary outcome was the summary risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia related to PARP inhibition versus placebo treatment in RCTs. We used a fixed-effects meta-analysis to obtain Peto odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. In a separate observational, retrospective, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study of VigiBase, cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia related to PARP inhibitor therapy were extracted on May 3, 2020, and clinical features summarised with a focus on median duration of PARP inhibitor exposure, median latency period between first drug exposure and diagnosis, and proportion of cases resulting in death. Our systematic review and safety meta-analysis were registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020175050. Our retrospective pharmacovigilance study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04326023. FINDINGS: For our safety meta-analysis, initial searches identified 1617 citations, and 31 RCTs were systematically reviewed for eligibility. 28 RCTs with available adverse events were analysed (18 placebo and ten non-placebo RCTs), with 5693 patients in PARP inhibitor groups and 3406 patients in control groups. Based on the 18 placebo RCTs (n=7307 patients), PARP inhibitors significantly increased the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia compared with placebo treatment (Peto OR 2.63 [95% CI 1.13-6.14], p=0.026) with no between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=0%, chi(2) p=0.91). The incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia across PARP inhibitor groups was 0.73% (95% CI 0.50-1.07; I(2)=0%, chi(2) p=0.87; 21 events out of 4533 patients) and across placebo groups was 0.47% (0.26-0.85; I(2)=0%, chi(2) p=1.00; three events out of 2774 patients). All 28 RCTs were rated as having unclear risk of bias. In VigiBase, 178 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (n=99) and acute myeloid leukaemia (n=79) related to PARP inhibitor therapy were extracted. In cases with available data, median treatment duration was 9.8 months (IQR 3.6-17.4; n=96) and median latency period since first exposure to a PARP inhibitor was 17.8 months (8.4-29.2; n=58). Of 104 cases that reported outcomes, 47 (45%) resulted in death. INTERPRETATION: PARP inhibitors increased the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia versus placebo treatment. These delayed and often lethal adverse events should be studied further to improve clinical understanding, particularly in the front-line maintenance setting.

Venetoclax is a promising new therapy approved for use in combination with a hypomethylating agent or with low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed older AML patients or those ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. (225) Actinium-lintuzumab ((225) Ac-lintuzumab) is a clinical stage radioimmunotherapy targeting CD33 that has shown evidence of single-agent activity in relapsed/refractory AML. Increased expression of MCL-1 is a mediator of resistance to venetoclax in cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we investigated the potential for (225) Ac-lintuzumab-directed DNA damage to suppress MCL-1 levels as a possible mechanism of reversing resistance to venetoclax in two preclinical in vivo models of AML. RESULTS: We demonstrated that (225) Ac-lintuzumab in combination with venetoclax induced a synergistic increase in tumor cell killing compared to treatment with either drug alone in venetoclax-resistant AML cell lines through both an induction of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) and depletion of MCL-1 protein levels. Further, this combination led to significant tumor growth control and prolonged survival benefit in venetoclax-resistant in vivo AML models. CONCLUSIONS: There results suggest that the combination of (225) Ac-lintuzumab with venetoclax is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with venetoclax-resistant AML. Clinical trial of this combination therapy (NCT03867682) is currently ongoing.","['Garg, Ravendra', 'Allen, Kevin J H', 'Dawicki, Wojciech', 'Geoghegan, Eileen M', 'Ludwig, Dale L', 'Dadachova, Ekaterina']","['Garg R', 'Allen KJH', 'Dawicki W', 'Geoghegan EM', 'Ludwig DL', 'Dadachova E']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7300-6479'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201221,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*225Ac-lintuzumab', '*Bcl-2', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*radioimmunotherapy', '*venetoclax']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/12/21 17:14'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3665 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2021 Feb;10(3):1128-1140. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3665.

L-asparaginase (Asp), a clinical drug for leukemia, has been shown to induce cell apoptosis in leukemia cells. No available information concerning GEN combined with Asp increased the cell apoptosis compared to GEN or Asp treatment alone. The objective of this study is to evaluate the anti-leukemia activity of GEN combined with Asp on human leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro. The cell viability, the distribution of cell cycle, apoptotic cell death, and the level of DeltaPsim were examined by flow cytometric assay. The expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins were measured by western blotting. GEN combined with Asp revealed a more significant decrease in total viable cells and induced a higher percentage of G2/M phase arrest, DNA damage, and cell apoptosis than that of GEN or Asp treatment only in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, the combined treatments (GEN and Asp) showed a higher decrease in the level of DeltaPsim than that of GEN or Asp treatment only. These results indicated that GEN combined with Asp induced mitochondria dysfunction by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential. The results from western blotting demonstrated that the treatment of GEN combined with Asp showed a higher increase in the levels of Bax and Bak (pro-apoptotic proteins) and an active form of caspase-3 and a higher decrease in Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) than that of GEN or Asp treatment alone. GEN significantly enhances the efficiency of Asp on cytotoxic effects (the induction of apoptosis) in HL-60 cells.","['Hsiao, Yin-Chen', 'Chueh, Fu-Shin', 'Ma, Yi-Shih', 'Lien, Jin-Cherng', 'Hsia, Te-Chun', 'Huang, Wen-Wen', 'Chou, Yu-Cheng', 'Chen, Po-Yuan', 'Chung, Jing-Gung', 'Chen, Hung-Yi', 'Liu, Kuo-Ching']","['Hsiao YC', 'Chueh FS', 'Ma YS', 'Lien JC', 'Hsia TC', 'Huang WW', 'Chou YC', 'Chen PY', 'Chung JG', 'Chen HY', 'Liu KC']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2359-9883', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2129-2586', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7303-2287']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201221,United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Genistein', 'L-asparaginase', 'apoptosis', 'human leukemia cancer HL-60 cells', 'mitochondria dysfunction']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/12/21 17:14'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.23078 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2021 May;36(5):764-772. doi: 10.1002/tox.23078.

Nonetheless, the significance of lncRNAs in AML prognosis remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic indicators of abnormally expressed lncRNAs in AML. Methods: Literature was searched using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases up to November 10, 2018. Results: Thirteen studies with 2755 individuals were included. The abnormal expression of lncRNAs was associated with worse overall survival (OS) in AML patients, especially in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), and was associated with shorter disease-free survival and event-free survival. Subgroup analysis showed that high levels of HOTAIR and TUG1 were associated with poor OS. Discussion: Overexpression of lncRNA HOTAIR and TUG1 were reported in two separate studies, and correlated with worse AML prognoses. Conclusion: Abnormally expressed lncRNAs are significantly related to worse prognoses of AML patients and might serve as potential prognostic markers to predict the prognosis of AML patients.","['Shi, Jie', 'Shi, Xin', 'Dai, Rong-Qin']","['Shi J', 'Shi X', 'Dai RQ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['LncRNA', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytogenetics', 'diagnostics', 'gene expression', 'meta-analysis', 'prognosis']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/12/21 12:08'],"['2020/12/21 12:08 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1779480 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):219-228. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1779480.,20210504,,"[""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhengzhou Central Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Critical Care Medicine, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HOTAIR long untranslated RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human)']","['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 23 mutations were revealed in theNRAS(n=9),KRAS(n=12), andFLT3(n=2) genes, according to statistics that was significantly more frequent than withBCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL, these genes mutations were not identified in patients (p=0.007). The frequency of mutations detection inKRASandNRASgenes in patients withBCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL was comparable as 12.9% (12 of 93) to 9.7% (9 of 93), respectively (p=0.488). One patient was simultaneously revealed 2 mutations in theKRASgene (in codons 13 and 61).FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 3.5% (2 of 57) cases ofBCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL. In patients withBCR-ABL1-positive B-ALLFLT3-ITD mutations were not assessed. Violations in the JAK/STAT signaling cascade were detected in 4 (4.3%) patients withBCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL. They were represented by the missense mutations ofJAK2gene (n=3) and the overexpression of CRLF2 (n=2); in one patient were detected the overexpression of CRLF2 and a mutation inJAK2gene simultaneously. No mutations were found inCRLF2gene. In patients withBCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL noJAK2mutations were detected. As long as analyzing demographic and clinical laboratory parameters between groups of patients with and without mutations, there were no statistically significant differences obtained. In the analyzed groups of patients, long-term therapy results did not differentiate according to the mutations presence inNRAS,KRAS,FLT3,JAK2genes. Also, substantive differences were not shown in the rate of the negative status achievement of the minimum residual disease between patients with and without activating mutations in the control points of the protocol (on the 70th, 133rd and 190th days). CONCLUSION: NRAS,KRAS,FLT3,JAK2activating mutations do not affect the long-term results of the therapy and the rate of the negative status achievement of the minimum residual disease in patients withBCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL treated by the Russian multicenter clinical trials.","['Zarubina, K I', 'Parovichnikova, E N', 'Surin, V L', 'Pshenichnikova, O S', 'Gavrilina, O A', 'Isinova, G A', 'Troitskaia, V V', 'Sokolov, A N', ""Gal'tseva, I V"", 'Kapranov, N M', 'Davydova, I O', 'Obukhova, T N', 'Sudarikov, A B', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Zarubina KI', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Surin VL', 'Pshenichnikova OS', 'Gavrilina OA', 'Isinova GA', 'Troitskaia VV', 'Sokolov AN', ""Gal'tseva IV"", 'Kapranov NM', 'Davydova IO', 'Obukhova TN', 'Sudarikov AB', 'Savchenko VG']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2947-6398', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6177-3566', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1890-4492', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5752-8146', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9969-8482', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2763-5391', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4827-8947', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1494-7978', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8490-6066', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6512-910X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5932-0285', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1613-652X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9463-9187', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8188-5557']",['rus'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200901,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL', 'BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL', 'CRLF2 genes', 'FLT3', 'JAK2', 'KRAS', 'activating mutations of NRAS', 'signaling pathways']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/12/21 08:47'],"['2020/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/21 08:47 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26442/00403660.2020.07.000772 [doi]'],epublish,Ter Arkh. 2020 Sep 1;92(7):31-42. doi: 10.26442/00403660.2020.07.000772.,20201222,,"['National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.', 'National Research Center for Hematology.']",['EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)'],"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Mutation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Russia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DG and its derivatives displayed significant pharmacological activities against inflammatory, hyperlipidemia, and various cancers. DG was selected to modify the cancer chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine (Ara-C) due to its anti-tumor activities as well as lipophilicity. After characterization, the biomembrane affinity and the kinetic thermal processes of the obtained DG-Ara-C conjugate were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thin hydration method with sonication was applied to prepare the DG-Ara-C liposomes without cholesterol since the DG moiety has the similar basic structure with cholesterol with more advantages. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis and cytotoxic analysis were employed to characterize the DG-Ara-C liposomes and investigate their biological activities, respectively. The results indicated that DG changed the biomembrane affinity of Ara-C and successfully replaced the cholesterol during the liposome preparation. The DG-Ara-C liposomes have an average particle size of around 116 nm with a narrow size distribution and revealed better anti-cancer activity against leukemia cells and solid tumor cells than that of free DG or Ara-C. Therefore, it can be concluded that DG displayed the potential application as an anti-cancer drug carrier to improve the bio-activities, since DG counted for a critical component in modulating the biomembrane affinity, preparation of liposome, and release of hydrophilic Ara-C from lipid vesicles.","['Liao, Ai-Mei', 'Cai, Bangrong', 'Huang, Ji-Hong', 'Hui, Ming', 'Lee, Kyung-Ku', 'Lee, Kwang Youl', 'Chun, ChangJu']","['Liao AM', 'Cai B', 'Huang JH', 'Hui M', 'Lee KK', 'Lee KY', 'Chun C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201218,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-cancer', 'Biomembrane affinity', 'Cytarabine', 'Diosgenin', 'Liposome']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/21 08:44'],"['2020/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 08:44 [entrez]']","['S0278-6915(20)30810-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2020.111920 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2021 Feb;148:111920. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2020.111920.

We retrospectively analyzed data from 295 adults with MDS or AML with mutational analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and examined differences in functional grouping of mutations and relation between morphologic blast count and variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations. Our analysis showed the distribution of mutations differed in MDS and AML. However, these differences largely disappeared when we compared MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB) and sAML. VAF of mutations generally did not correlate with morphologic blast count and the distribution of VAF was similar above and below the 20% cutpoint. Complete remission (CR) rate was similar in MDS-EB and sAML following high intensity therapy and survival was also similar. These results support that MDS-EB and sAML have overlapping features and may represent a spectrum of the same disease.Key pointsThe distribution of genetic mutations is similar in myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts (MDS-EB) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) regardless of morphologic blast count.Variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of gene mutations do not correlate well with morphologic blast counts, particularly in MDS-EB and sAML.Complete remission (CR) rate was similar in MDS-EB and sAML following high intensity or low intensity therapy.","['Chen, Xueyan', 'Othus, Megan', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Percival, Mary-Elizabeth', 'Abkowitz, Janis L', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Chen X', 'Othus M', 'Wood BL', 'Walter RB', 'Becker PS', 'Percival ME', 'Abkowitz JL', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Estey EH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201219,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*genetic mutations', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*variant allele frequency']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/12/21 08:42'],"['2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 08:42 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1861267 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 May;62(5):1226-1233. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1861267.

Flow cytometry (FCM) can identify both physical and fluorescent properties of cells together, and by using fluorescent nucleic-acid-binding dyes, FCM can identify variations in total nucleic-acid content of cells. FxCycle(TM) Violet dye (FxCV) is a selective DNA-binding dye which permits simultaneous multiparametric immunophenotyping and cell-cycle/ploidy assessment in a single assay. To date, only two studies have demonstrated the feasibility of FxCV-aided FCM-ploidy analysis in B-ALL patients and only one of these studies have compared their results with CG-ploidy. METHODOLOGY: Blast size-specific FCM-ploidy was prospectively analyzed using FxCV-dye in 109 pediatric B-ALL patients, and the results were compared with concurrent CG-ploidy status. RESULTS: FCM-ploidy categorization was feasible in 98% of samples tested and the results were 82% concordant with CG-ploidy status. We observed significant correlation between DNA content and blast size (r = .823, P < .001) and could demonstrate size differences between diploid vs low-hyperdiploid (P = .025), diploid vs high-hyperdiploid (P < .001) and low- vs high-hyperdiploid blasts (P = .007). CONCLUSION: FCM-ploidy assessment using FxCV dye is a reliable assay and the results closely concur with CG-based ploidy stratification and risk assessment. Using blast size-assisted DNA content analysis, the results of FCM-ploidy analysis can be further fine-tuned.","['Bommannan, Karthik', 'Arumugam, Jhansi Rani', 'Koshy, Teena', 'Radhakrishnan, Venkatraman', 'Sagar, Tenali Gnana', 'Sundersingh, Shirley']","['Bommannan K', 'Arumugam JR', 'Koshy T', 'Radhakrishnan V', 'Sagar TG', 'Sundersingh S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0851-886X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201220,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'DNA Index', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'blast size index', 'flow cytometric ploidy', 'pediatric']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/12/21 06:14'],"['2020/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 06:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13436 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Aug;43(4):760-770. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13436.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of histopathology, IHC, and clonality testing to differentiate between IBD and LSA and agreement of diagnostic results for endoscopic biopsy (EB) samples from the upper (USI) and lower small intestine (LSI). ANIMALS: Fifty-seven cats with IBD or LSA. METHODS: All cases were categorized as definitive IBD (DefIBD), possible LSA (PossLSA), probable LSA (ProbLSA), or definitive LSA (DefLSA) based on histopathology alone. Results from IHC and clonality testing were integrated. RESULTS: Based on histopathology alone, 24/57 (42.1%), 15/57 (26.3%), and 18/57 (31.6%) cats were diagnosed with DefIBD, PossLSA or ProbLSA, and DefLSA, respectively. After integrating IHC and clonality testing, 11/24 cases (45.8%) and 15/15 cases (100%) previously categorized as DefIBD and PossLSA or ProbLSA, respectively, were reclassified as LSA. A final diagnosis of IBD and LSA was reported in 13/57 (22.8%) and 44/57 (77.2%) cats, respectively. Agreement between USI and LSI samples was moderate based on histopathology alone (kappa = 0.66) and after integrating IHC and clonality testing (kappa = 0.70). However, only 1/44 (2.3%) of the LSA cases was diagnosed based on LSI biopsy alone.

DNA has been the presumptive target of the front-line prodrug for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cytarabine (ara-C), since the 1980s. Here, the biomolecular targeting of ara-C was evaluated in primary white blood cells using the ara-C mimic ""AzC"" and azide-alkyne ""click"" reactions. Fluorescent staining and microscopy revealed that metabolic incorporation of AzC into primary white blood cells was unexpectedly enhanced by the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicholine. According to RNaseH digestion and pull-down-and-release experiments, AzC was incorporated into short RNA fragments bound to DNA in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) collected from all six healthy human donors tested. Samples from 22 AML patients (French-American-British classes M4 and M5) exhibited much more heterogeneity, with 27% incorporating AzC into RNA and 55% into DNA. The overall survival of AML patients whose samples incorporated AzC into RNA was approximately 3-fold higher as compared to that of the DNA cohort (p </= 0.056, chi(2) = 3.65). These results suggest that the RNA primers of DNA synthesis are clinically favorable targets of ara-C, and that variable incorporation of nucleoside drugs into DNA versus RNA may enable future patient stratification into treatment-specific subgroups.","['Messikommer, Alessandra', 'Seipel, Katja', 'Byrne, Stephen', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Luedtke, Nathan W']","['Messikommer A', 'Seipel K', 'Byrne S', 'Valk PJM', 'Pabst T', 'Luedtke NW']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201012,United States,ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,ACS pharmacology & translational science,101721411,,,,2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:10'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/21 06:10 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsptsci.0c00120 [doi]'],epublish,ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci. 2020 Oct 12;3(6):1225-1232. doi: 10.1021/acsptsci.0c00120. eCollection 2020 Dec 11.,,,"['Department of Chemistry, University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Inselspital and University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Inselspital and University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1A3, Canada.']",,,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,PMC7737216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PLB played anticancer activity via many molecular mechanisms, such as targeting apoptosis, autophagy pathway, cell cycle arrest, antiangiogenesis pathway, anti-invasion, and antimetastasis pathway. Among these signaling pathways, the key regulatory genes regulated by PLB were NF-kbeta, STAT3, and AKT. PLB also acted as a potent inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppressor of cellular glutathione, and novel proteasome inhibitor, causing DNA double-strand break by oxidative DNA base damage.

Intensive therapy is typically used as salvage treatment for those with R/R AML. No data are currently available about the use of the CLAG-M protocol as salvage therapy in paediatric patients with R/R AML. CASE SUMMARY: An 8-year-old patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia by bone marrow morphology and immunophenotype. The patient showed poor response to two cycles of induction therapy with 60% blast cells in the bone marrow after the second induction cycle. The patient achieved complete remission after being treated with the CLAG-M protocol as salvage therapy before undergoing umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation. Morphological complete remission with haematological recovery has hitherto been maintained over 4 mo. Abnormal gene mutations detected at diagnosis were undetectable after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: Here we present a paediatric patient with primary refractory acute myeloid leukaemia who was successfully treated with the CLAG-M protocol. Given the positive results of the presented patient, large-scale clinical studies are required to assess the role of the CLAG-M protocol in the salvage treatment of refractory or relapsed AML in childhood.","['Huang, Jie', 'Yang, Xiao-Yun', 'Rong, Liu-Cheng', 'Xue, Yao', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Fang, Yong-Jun']","['Huang J', 'Yang XY', 'Rong LC', 'Xue Y', 'Zhu J', 'Fang YJ']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'CLAG-M protocol', 'Case report', 'Refractory', 'Salvage therapy', 'child']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:09'],"['2020/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:09 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v8.i22.5603 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2020 Nov 26;8(22):5603-5610. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v8.i22.5603.,,"['(c)The Author(s) 2020.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the serous effusions of hematopoietic malignancies over an 11-year period, along with ancillary studies, clinical and histological data. We compared cytological along with histological diagnosis to evaluate the value of cytology itself. Furthermore, the discrepant cases were reviewed. Results: In this study, a total of 242 cases were identified as hematopoietic malignancies. Ancillary technologies were performed: in 24 cases FCM, 242 cases ICC, 35 cases ISH, 81 cases PCR and 10 cases FISH. Cyto-histological correlation was available for 122 cases. The subtyping of hematopoietic malignancies was achieved using cytological material in 65/122 cases (53.3%). Of the 65 cases, T-Acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (22.1%) was the leading subtype, followed by Burkitt lymphoma (5.7%), plasmacytoma (5.7%). Cyto-histological correlation showed a 100% concordant rate of diagnosis for hematopoietic malignancies and a high degree of agreement on sub-classification (51.6%). In this regard, T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, plasmacytoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, myeloid sarcoma, and follicular lymphoma showed the highest degree of agreement (100%). The sub-classification on cytology was achieved in 53 out of the remaining 120 cases without histological diagnosis (44.2%). T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (20.8%) was again the most frequently encountered subtype, followed by plasmacytoma (5.8%) and Burkitt lymphoma (4.2%). Conclusions: This large series study provided evidence that combining cytology and ancillary studies enabled the accurate serous effusions cytological diagnoses and subsequent sub-classification for the described malignancies.","['Li, Jinnan', 'Zhao, Sha', 'Zhang, Wenyan', 'Jiang, Yong', 'Zhu, Xianglan', 'Den, Xueqin', 'Liu, Weiping', 'Su, Xueying']","['Li J', 'Zhao S', 'Zhang W', 'Jiang Y', 'Zhu X', 'Den X', 'Liu W', 'Su X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201203,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,['NOTNLM'],"['ancillary studies', 'cyto-histological correlation', 'cytology', 'hematopoietic malignancies', 'serous effusions']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:08'],"['2020/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:08 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2020.615080 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2020 Dec 3;7:615080. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2020.615080. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Li, Zhao, Zhang, Jiang, Zhu, Den, Liu and Su.']","['Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7744785,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A promising approach to meet the need for improved cancer treatment is drug repurposing. Dasatinib, a second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), is a potent treatment agent for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) approved by FDA, however, its off-targets and the underlying mechanisms in lung cancer have not been elucidated yet. LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) is a serine/threonine kinase, which is highly upregulated in human cancers. Herein, we demonstrated that dasatinib dose-dependently blocked lung cancer cell proliferation and repressed LIMK1 activities by directly targeting LIMK1. It was confirmed that knockdown of LIMK1 expression suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation. From the in silico screening results, dasatinib may target to LIMK1. Indeed, dasatinib significantly inhibited the LIMK1 activity as evidenced by kinase and binding assay, and computational docking model analysis. Dasatinib inhibited lung cancer cell growth, while induced cell apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Meanwhile, dasatinib also suppressed the expression of markers relating cell cycle, cyclin D1, D3, and CDK2, and increased the levels of markers involved in cell apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-7 by downregulating phosphorylated LIMK1 (p-LIMK1) and cofilin (p-cofilin). Furthermore, in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), dasatinib (30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the growth of tumors in SCID mice which highly expressed LIMK1 without changing the bodyweight. In summary, our results indicate that dasatinib acts as a novel LIMK1 inhibitor to suppress the lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, which suggests evidence for the application of dasatinib in lung cancer therapy.","['Zhang, Man', 'Tian, Jie', 'Wang, Rui', 'Song, Mengqiu', 'Zhao, Ran', 'Chen, Hanyong', 'Liu, Kangdong', 'Shim, Jung-Hyun', 'Zhu, Feng', 'Dong, Zigang', 'Lee, Mee-Hyun']","['Zhang M', 'Tian J', 'Wang R', 'Song M', 'Zhao R', 'Chen H', 'Liu K', 'Shim JH', 'Zhu F', 'Dong Z', 'Lee MH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201204,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['LIMK1', 'dasatinib', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'off-targets', 'patient-derived xenografts']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:08'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:08 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.556532 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Dec 4;8:556532. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.556532. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang, Tian, Wang, Song, Zhao, Chen, Liu, Shim, Zhu, Dong and', 'Lee.']","['China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam, South Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, South Korea.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7746816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated a flow cytometric assay (CD160-ROR1FCA) targeting the tumor-specific antigens CD160 and receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), along with CD2, CD5, CD19, CD45. CD160-ROR1FCA was compared with the originally published 8-colour European Research Initiative for CLL (ERIC) gold-standard assay for CLL MRD detection. CD160-ROR1FCA had a limit of detection of 0.001% and showed strong correlation with ERIC (R = 0.98, p < 0.01) with negligible differences in MRD detection (bias -0.3152 95%CI 5.586 to -6.216). Using CD160-ROR1FCA, increased expression of both CD160 and ROR1 was found in Monoclonal B cell Lymphocytosis (MBL) compared to low-level polyclonal B-cell expansions (p < 0.01). Patients in CR and with undetectable MRD had a longer EFS (not reached) than those in CR but with detectable MRD (756 days, p < 0.01) versus 113 days in patients with partial remission (p < 0.01). Patients with MRD levels of >0.01 to 0.1% had a longer EFS (2,333 days), versus levels between 0.1 to 1% (1,049 days). CD160-ROR1FCA is a novel assay for routine CLL MRD measurement and for MBL detection. MRD status assessed by CD160-ROR1FCA after CLL treatment correlated with EFS.","['Farren, Timothy W', 'Sadanand, Kaushik S', 'Agrawal, Samir G']","['Farren TW', 'Sadanand KS', 'Agrawal SG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201203,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD160', 'ROR-1', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'immunophenotyping', 'minimal/measurable residual disease', 'monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:08'],"['2020/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:08 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.597730 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Dec 3;10:597730. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.597730. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Farren, Sadanand and Agrawal.']","['Department of Haemato-Oncology and Immunophenotyping (SIHMDS), Barts Health NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haemato-Oncology and Immunophenotyping (SIHMDS), Barts Health NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7744938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This study of the Hellenic MDS Study Group included 687 consecutive patients with higher-risk MDS and oligoblastic AML treated with 5-AZA. Results: The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) revised version (IPSS-R), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (0 or 1 versus 2) and baseline serum ferritin (SF) levels > 520 ng/ml were shown to independently predict response to 5-AZA. In the survival analysis, the IPSS and IPSS-R risk classification systems along with the ECOG PS and SF levels > 520 ng/ml proved to be independent prognosticators for overall survival (OS), as well as for leukemia-free survival (LFS). Next, we built new multivariate models for OS and LFS, incorporating only ECOG PS and SF levels besides IPSS or IPSS-R risk classification systems. Thereby, the new modified IPSS and IPSS-R risk classification systems (H-PSS, H-PSS-R) could each discriminate a low, an intermediate and a high-risk patient group regarding OS and LFS. The H-PSS and H-PSS-R proved to be better predictors of OS than their previous counterparts as well as the French prognostic score, while the most powerful OS predictor was the new, H-PSS-R system. Conclusions: ECOG PS and SF levels > 520 ng/ml independently predict response to 5-AZA, OS and LFS. Their incorporation in the IPSS and IPSS-R scores enhances these scores' predictive power in 5-AZA-treated higher-risk MDS and oligoblastic AML patients.","['Papageorgiou, Sotirios G', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Bouchla, Anthi', 'Symeonidis, Argyris', 'Galanopoulos, Athanasios', 'Viniou, Nora-Athina', 'Hatzimichael, Eleftheria', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Gogos, Dimitrios', 'Megalakaki, Aikaterini', 'Zikos, Panagiotis', 'Diamantopoulos, Panagiotis', 'Kourakli, Alexandra', 'Giannoulia, Panagiota', 'Papoutselis, Menelaos', 'Poulakidas, Elias', 'Arapaki, Maria', 'Vardi, Anna', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Mparmparousi, Despoina', 'Papaioannou, Maria', 'Bouronikou, Eleni', 'Dimou, Maria', 'Papadaki, Helen', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Pappa, Vasiliki']","['Papageorgiou SG', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Bouchla A', 'Symeonidis A', 'Galanopoulos A', 'Viniou NA', 'Hatzimichael E', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Gogos D', 'Megalakaki A', 'Zikos P', 'Diamantopoulos P', 'Kourakli A', 'Giannoulia P', 'Papoutselis M', 'Poulakidas E', 'Arapaki M', 'Vardi A', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Mparmparousi D', 'Papaioannou M', 'Bouronikou E', 'Dimou M', 'Papadaki H', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Pappa V']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3376-837X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201208,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'outcome', 'prognosis', 'risk classification system', 'survival']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:06'],"['2020/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:06 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620720966121 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720966121 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Dec 8;11:2040620720966121. doi: 10.1177/2040620720966121. eCollection 2020.,,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']","['Consultant of Hematology, Second Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", 1 Rimini St., Haidari, Athens, 12462, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', 'The Hellenic (Greek) MDS Study Group, Greece.', 'The Hellenic (Greek) MDS Study Group, Greece.', 'The Hellenic (Greek) MDS Study Group, Greece.', 'University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'General Hospital ""Bostanio"" Mytilini, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Metaxa"" Piraeus Cancer Hospital, Piraeus, Greece.', 'General Hospital of Patras ""Agios Andreas"", Patras, Greece.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'General University Hospital of Patras, Rio Patron, Patras, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Evangelismos"" Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', '""401"" Army General Hospital of Athens, Mesogeion and Kanellopoulou 1, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Hematology Department, General Hospital of Thessaloniki ""George Papanikolaou"", Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hematology Department, General Hospital of Thessaloniki ""George Papanikolaou"", Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Hematology Department, University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'University General Hospital of Larissa, Mezourlo, Larissa, Greece.', 'First Propaedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'University General Hospital of Heraklion, Voutes, Heraklion, Greece.', 'First Propaedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.']",,,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,PMC7727043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify different diseases, e.g., leukemia. Leukemia is a white blood cells- (WBC-) related illness affecting the bone marrow and/or blood. A quick, safe, and accurate early-stage diagnosis of leukemia plays a key role in curing and saving patients' lives. Based on developments, leukemia consists of two primary forms, i.e., acute and chronic leukemia. Each form can be subcategorized as myeloid and lymphoid. There are, therefore, four leukemia subtypes. Various approaches have been developed to identify leukemia with respect to its subtypes. However, in terms of effectiveness, learning process, and performance, these methods require improvements. This study provides an Internet of Medical Things- (IoMT-) based framework to enhance and provide a quick and safe identification of leukemia. In the proposed IoMT system, with the help of cloud computing, clinical gadgets are linked to network resources. The system allows real-time coordination for testing, diagnosis, and treatment of leukemia among patients and healthcare professionals, which may save both time and efforts of patients and clinicians. Moreover, the presented framework is also helpful for resolving the problems of patients with critical condition in pandemics such as COVID-19. The methods used for the identification of leukemia subtypes in the suggested framework are Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet-121) and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-34). Two publicly available datasets for leukemia, i.e., ALL-IDB and ASH image bank, are used in this study. The results demonstrated that the suggested models supersede the other well-known machine learning algorithms used for healthy-versus-leukemia-subtypes identification.","['Bibi, Nighat', 'Sikandar, Misba', 'Ud Din, Ikram', 'Almogren, Ahmad', 'Ali, Sikandar']","['Bibi N', 'Sikandar M', 'Ud Din I', 'Almogren A', 'Ali S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3586-7363', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2695-8546', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8896-547X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8253-9709', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2753-8615']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201203,England,J Healthc Eng,Journal of healthcare engineering,101528166,IM,,,2020/12/22 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/12/21 06:06'],"['2020/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:06 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/6648574 [doi]'],epublish,J Healthc Eng. 2020 Dec 3;2020:6648574. doi: 10.1155/2020/6648574. eCollection 2020.,20210104,['Copyright (c) 2020 Nighat Bibi et al.'],"['Department of Information Technology, TheUniversity of Haripur, Haripur 22620, Pakistan.', 'Department of Information Technology, TheUniversity of Haripur, Haripur 22620, Pakistan.', 'Department of Information Technology, TheUniversity of Haripur, Haripur 22620, Pakistan.', 'Department of Computer Science, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11633, Saudi Arabia.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Petroleum Data Mining, China University of Petroleum-Beijing, Beijing 102249, China.']",,"['Algorithms', 'COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Cloud Computing', 'Databases, Factual', '*Deep Learning', '*Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Humans', '*Internet of Things', 'Leukemia/*classification/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Neural Networks, Computer', '*Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Telemedicine']","['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this work.']",,,PMC7732373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of the innate-like T cells, particularly gammadelta T (gammadeltaT) cells and MR1-restricted T lymphocytes, is incompletely explored, mainly through animal models, or by use of surrogate lineage markers, respectively. Here, we used case-control settings, multiparameter flow cytometry, 5-OP-RU-loaded MR1-tetramers, Luminex technology and targeted qRT-PCR to dissect the cellular and transcriptional landscape of gammadelta and MR1-restricted blood T cells in untreated PV cases (n=21, 22 matched controls). High interpersonal differences in cell composition were observed, fueling transcriptional variability at healthy baseline. A minor subset of canonical CD4(+)CD8(+)MR1-tet(+)TCRValpha7.2(+) and CD4(+)CD8(-)MR1-tet(+)TCRValpha7.2(+) T cells was the most significantly underrepresented community in male PV individuals, whereas Vdelta2(+) gammadelta T cells expressing high levels of TCR and Vdelta1(-)delta2(-) gammadelta T cells expressing intermediate levels of TCR were selectively enriched in affected males, partly reflecting disease severity. Our findings highlight a formerly unappreciated skewing of human circulating MAIT and gammadelta cytomes during PV, and reveal their compositional changes in relation to sex, CMV exposure, serum cytokine content, BMI, and inflammatory burden. Complementing numerical alterations, we finally show that flow-sorted, MAIT and gammadelta populations exhibit divergent transcriptional changes in mild type I psoriasis, consisting of differential bulk expression for signatures of cytotoxicity/type-1 immunity (EOMES, RUNX3, IL18R), type-3 immunity (RORC, CCR6), and T cell innateness (ZBTB16).","['Pluzaric, Vera', 'Stefanic, Mario', 'Mihalj, Martina', 'Tolusic Levak, Maja', 'Mursic, Ivanka', 'Glavas-Obrovac, Ljubica', 'Petrek, Martin', 'Balogh, Peter', 'Tokic, Stana']","['Pluzaric V', 'Stefanic M', 'Mihalj M', 'Tolusic Levak M', 'Mursic I', 'Glavas-Obrovac L', 'Petrek M', 'Balogh P', 'Tokic S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201203,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*MR1', '*cytokines', '*gammadelta T lymphocytes', '*mucosal associated invariant T cells', '*psoriasis']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/12/21 06:04'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.572924 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Dec 3;11:572924. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.572924. eCollection 2020.,20210614,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Pluzaric, Stefanic, Mihalj, Tolusic Levak, Mursic,', 'Glavas-Obrovac, Petrek, Balogh and Tokic.']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University Hospital Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University Hospital Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University Hospital Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University Hospital Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.', 'Department of Pathological Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.']","['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (MR1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']","['Adult', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*metabolism', 'Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Psoriasis/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Young Adult']","['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7744298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the virulence factors and the molecular mechanisms of Chlamydia psittaci are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of the plasmid-encoded protein CPSIT_P7 of C. psittaci in regulating the inflammatory response in THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line). Based on cytokine arrays, CPSIT_P7 induces the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in THP-1 cells. Moreover, the expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 stimulated by CPSIT_P7 declined after silencing of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene using small interfering RNA and transfection of a dominant negative plasmid encoding TLR4 (pZERO-hTLR4). We further demonstrated that transfection with the dominant negative plasmid encoding MyD88 (pDeNy-hMyD88) and the dominant negative plasmid encoding Mal (pDeNy-hMal) could also abrogate the expression of the corresponding proteins. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay results showed that CPSIT_P7 could activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways in THP-1 cells. Altogether, our results indicate that the CPSIT_P7 induces the TLR4/Mal/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling axis and therefore contributes to the inflammatory cytokine response.","['Chen, Qian', 'Li, Yumeng', 'Yan, Xiaoliang', 'Sun, Zhenjie', 'Wang, Chuan', 'Liu, Shuangquan', 'Xiao, Jian', 'Lu, Chunxue', 'Wu, Yimou']","['Chen Q', 'Li Y', 'Yan X', 'Sun Z', 'Wang C', 'Liu S', 'Xiao J', 'Lu C', 'Wu Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201203,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,['NOTNLM'],"['CPSIT_P7', 'Chlamydia psittaci', 'TLR4', 'human monocytes', 'inflammation']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:04'],"['2020/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.578009 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Dec 3;11:578009. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.578009. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Chen, Li, Yan, Sun, Wang, Liu, Xiao, Lu and Wu.']","['Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Research, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens Prevention and Control, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7744487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar CAR-T clinical trials have also been carried out in patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, no systematic review has evaluated the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapy in RRMM. The purpose of this study was to fill this literature gap. Methods: Eligible studies were searched in PUBMED, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CNKI, and WanFang from data inception to December 2019. For efficacy assessment, the overall response rate (ORR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, strict complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) were calculated. The incidence of any grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs) were calculated for safety analysis. The effect estimates were then pooled using an inverse variance method. Results: Overall, 27 studies involving 497 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled ORR and MRD negativity rate were 89% (95% Cl: 83-94%) and 81% (95% Cl: 67-91%), respectively. The pooled sCR, CR, VGPR, and PR were 14% (95% Cl: 5-27%), 13% (95% Cl: 4-26%), 23% (95% Cl: 14-33%), and 15% (95% Cl: 10-21%), respectively. Subgroup analyses of ORR by age, proportion of previous autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and target selection of CAR-T cells revealed that age </= 55 years (</=55 years vs. > 55 years, p = 0.0081), prior ASCT </=70% (</=70% vs. > 70%, p = 0.035), and bispecific CAR-T cells (dual B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)/BCMA + CD19 vs specific BCMA, p = 0.0329) associated with higher ORR in patients. Subgroup analyses of remission depth by target selection suggested that more patients achieved a better response than VGPR with dual BCMA/BCMA + CD19 CAR-T cells compared to specific BCMA targeting (p = 0.0061). In terms of safety, the pooled incidence of any grade and grade >/= 3 CRS was 76% (95% CL: 63-87%) and 11% (95% CL: 6-17%). The most common grade >/= 3 AEs were hematologic toxic effects. Conclusion: In heavily treated patients, CAR-T therapy associates with promising responses and tolerable AEs, as well as CRS in RRMM. However, additional information regarding the durability of CAR-T cell therapy, as well as further randomized controlled trials, is needed.","['Xiang, Xinrong', 'He, Qiao', 'Ou, Yang', 'Wang, Wen', 'Wu, Yu']","['Xiang X', 'He Q', 'Ou Y', 'Wang W', 'Wu Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201203,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer immunotherapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'efficacy', 'meta-analysis', 'multiple myeloma', 'safety']",2020/12/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:01,['2020/12/21 06:04'],"['2020/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2020.544754 [doi]', '544754 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Dec 3;11:544754. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.544754. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Xiang, He, Ou, Wang and Wu.']","['Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Chinese Evidence-based Medicine Center and Cochrane China Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Chinese Evidence-based Medicine Center and Cochrane China Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",,,"['The authors state that the research was performed in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7744881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The continuous state of uncertainty the survivors might go through can lead to a serious impact on their quality of life (QoL), which is collectively referred to as Damocles syndrome. Given the increasing numbers of cancer survivors, it is crucial to understand the different psychological issues that face them, including Damocles syndrome. Herein, we review the current literature of Damocles syndrome specifically in hematologic cancer survivors. Although with inconsistent terms, current literature demonstrates the impact and the prevalence of Damocles syndrome on QoL of survivors of leukemia, lymphoma, and hematopoietic cell transplant. Interventional studies are very limited in this area. Moreover, hematologic malignancy survivors can also meet the diagnostic criteria of other psychiatric diseases, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, wherein they should be managed accordingly. It is important to increase the awareness about Damocles syndrome and screen patients for it and other related psychological disorders. Additionally, this review has shown the need for standardization of Damocles syndrome definitions. Finally, the lack of interventional studies that target survivors' psychosocial challenges calls for prospective research to better address this rising problem.","['Alabdaljabar, Mohamad S', 'Muhsen, Ibrahim N', 'Knight, Jennifer M', 'Syrjala, Karen L', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K']","['Alabdaljabar MS', 'Muhsen IN', 'Knight JM', 'Syrjala KL', 'Hashmi SK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20201201,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Damocles', '*Hematologic malignancy', '*Survivors', '*Sword']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2020/12/21 05:36'],"['2020/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 05:36 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(20)30133-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2020.100783 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2021 Jul;48:100783. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2020.100783.

As a mitochondrial quality control process, mitophagy is greatly inhibited in AD; increasing evidence shows that the induction of mitophagy is an effective therapeutic intervention strategy. However, the lack of more safe, effective, and clear mechanisms for mitophagy inducers has limited the clinical application. In recent studies, we have identified a small molecule compound, UMI-77, that can safely and effectively induce mitophagy. UMI-77 is an established BH3-mimetic for MCL1 and was developed to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. We found that UMI-77 can bind MCL1 and enhance its function as a mitophagy receptor protein, thus enhancing its interaction with LC3A to induce mitophagy. UMI-77 effectively improves the cognitive decline seen in an AD mouse model. Our findings shed light on the novel mechanisms of mitophagy, reveal that MCL1 is a mitophagy receptor that can be targeted to induce mitophagy, and identify MCL1 as a drug target for therapeutic intervention in AD.","['Cen, Xufeng', 'Xu, Xiaoyan', 'Xia, Hongguang']","['Cen X', 'Xu X', 'Xia H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20201220,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Alzheimer disease', '*MCL1', '*UMI-77', '*mitophagy', '*neurodegeneration']",2020/12/22 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/12/21 05:30'],"['2020/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 05:30 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2020.1860542 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2021 Mar;17(3):818-819. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2020.1860542.

Such signal artifacts are known as spillover effects and can substantially limit the accuracy of cell population clustering. Current approaches reduce these effects by using additional beads for normalization purposes known as single-stained controls. While effective in compensating for spillover effects, incorporating single-stained controls can be costly and require customized panel design. This is especially evident when executing large-scale immune profiling studies. We present a novel statistical method, named CytoSpill that independently quantifies and compensates the spillover effects in CyTOF data without requiring the use of single-stained controls. Our method utilizes knowledge-guided modeling and statistical techniques, such as finite mixture modeling and sequential quadratic programming, to achieve optimal error correction. We evaluated our method using five publicly available CyTOF datasets obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow, healthy human bone marrow, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient, and healthy human cord blood samples. In the PBMCs with known ground truth, our method achieved comparable results to experiments that incorporated single-stained controls. In datasets without ground-truth, our method not only reduced spillover on likely affected markers, but also led to the discovery of potentially novel subpopulations expressing functionally meaningful, cluster-specific markers.

However, the molecular determinants driving these long-term responses remain elusive. To address this issue, we performed an integrative analysis of genomic and transcriptomic features of long-term immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-associated responders. We assembled a cohort of 47 patients with NSCLC receiving ICIs that was enriched in long-term responders [>18 months of progression-free survival (PFS)]. We performed whole-exome sequencing from tumor samples, estimated the tumor mutational burden (TMB), and inferred the somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). We also obtained gene transcription data for a subset of patients using Nanostring, which we used to assess the tumor immune infiltration status and PD-L1 expression. Our results indicate that there is an association between TMB and benefit to ICIs, which is driven by those patients with long-term response. Additionally, high SCNAs burden is associated with poor response and negatively correlates with the presence of several immune cell types (B cells, natural killers, regulatory T cells or effector CD8 T cells). Also, CD274 (PD-L1) expression is increased in patients with benefit, mainly in those with long-term response. In our cohort, combined assessment of TMB and SCNAs burden enabled identification of long-term responders (considering PFS and overall survival). Notably, the association between TMB, SCNAs burden, and PD-L1 expression with the outcomes of ICIs treatment was validated in two public datasets of ICI-treated patients with NSCLC. Thus, our data indicate that TMB is associated with long-term benefit following ICIs treatment in NSCLC and that TMB, SCNAs burden, and PD-L1 are complementary determinants of response to ICIs.","['Frigola, Joan', 'Navarro, Alejandro', 'Carbonell, Caterina', 'Callejo, Ana', 'Iranzo, Patricia', 'Cedres, Susana', 'Martinez-Marti, Alex', 'Pardo, Nuria', 'Saoudi-Gonzalez, Nadia', 'Martinez, Debora', 'Jimenez, Jose', 'Sansano, Irene', 'Mancuso, Francesco M', 'Nuciforo, Paolo', 'Montuenga, Luis M', 'Sanchez-Cespedes, Montse', 'Prat, Aleix', 'Vivancos, Ana', 'Felip, Enriqueta', 'Amat, Ramon']","['Frigola J', 'Navarro A', 'Carbonell C', 'Callejo A', 'Iranzo P', 'Cedres S', 'Martinez-Marti A', 'Pardo N', 'Saoudi-Gonzalez N', 'Martinez D', 'Jimenez J', 'Sansano I', 'Mancuso FM', 'Nuciforo P', 'Montuenga LM', 'Sanchez-Cespedes M', 'Prat A', 'Vivancos A', 'Felip E', 'Amat R']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8284-2540'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210106,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*NSCLC', '*PD-L1', '*chromosomal alterations burden', '*copy number alterations', '*immune checkpoint inhibitors', '*long-term benefit', '*tumor mutational burden']",2020/12/21 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2020/12/20 20:33'],"['2020/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/20 20:33 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12891 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2021 Apr;15(4):887-900. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12891.

METHOD: We analyzed 159 alloHCT recipients with 4409 quantitative CMV viral loads to determine pre-transplant predictors of CMV reactivation, clinically significant CMV infection (cs-CMVi, defined as CMV viral load >1000 IU/mL), CMV disease, kinetics of spontaneous clearance of CMV, and survival using a standardized pre-emptive therapy approach to identify at-risk groups to target prevention strategies. RESULTS: Cs-CMVi was most common in D-/R+ unrelated donor transplants (URD). Spontaneous CMV clearance occurred in 26% of patients who reached a viral load of 56-137 IU/mL, 6% at 138-250 IU/mL and in one patient >250 IU/mL. Median time between the first CMV reactivation (>56 IU/mL) and a viral load >250 IU/mL was 13 days, whereas the time from the first viral load >250 IU/mL to reach a vial load >1000 IU/mL was 4 days. Cs-CMVi was associated with a significant increase in non-relapse mortality (NRM) on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study indicates that D-/R+ URD recipients are at high-risk for cs-CMVi- and CMV-related mortality, and are potential candidates for targeted CMV prophylaxis. Spontaneous clearance of CMV beyond a viral load of 250 IU/mL is uncommon, suggesting that this could be used as an appropriate threshold to initiate pre-emptive therapy.","['Lindsay, Julian', 'Othman, Jad', 'Kerridge, Ian', 'Fay, Keith', 'Stevenson, William', 'Arthur, Chris', 'Chen, Sharon C-A', 'Kong, David C M', 'Pergam, Steven A', 'Liu, Catherine', 'Slavin, Monica A', 'Greenwood, Matthew']","['Lindsay J', 'Othman J', 'Kerridge I', 'Fay K', 'Stevenson W', 'Arthur C', 'Chen SC', 'Kong DCM', 'Pergam SA', 'Liu C', 'Slavin MA', 'Greenwood M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7086-538X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6333-5196']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210105,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['cytomegalovirus', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'pre-emptive therapy', 'viremia']",2020/12/21 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/12/20 20:32'],"['2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/20 20:32 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.13548 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2021 Jun;23(3):e13548. doi: 10.1111/tid.13548.

It has been risk-stratified on the basis of clinical (age, metastasis and extent of resection) and histological subtypes (classic, desmoplastic and anaplastic). However, recently medulloblastoma has been sub-grouped by using a variety of different genomic approaches, such as gene expression profiling, micro-ribonucleic acid profiling and methylation array into 4 groups, namely Wingless, Sonic hedgehog, Group 3 and Group 4. This new sub-grouping has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. After acute leukaemia, brain tumour is the second most common malignancy in the paediatric age group. The improvement in outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in low- and middle-income countries reflects the relative simplicity of diagnostic procedures and management. Unlike leukaemia, the management of brain tumours requires a complex multidisciplinary approach, including neuro-radiologists, neurosurgeons with a paediatric expertise, neuropathologists, radiation oncologists and neuro-oncologists. In addition, the equipment required for the diagnosis (magnetic resonance imaging scan, histological, molecular and genetic techniques) and the management (operating room, radiation facilities) is a limiting factor in countries with limited resources.

Screening of an in-house compound library, constructed at Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, identified a novel compound designated ""31"" that was found to be an inhibitor of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The compound inhibited T-cell factor (TCF) activity in a TCF firefly luciferase-reporter assay and suppressed the proliferation of several human AML cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 31 arrested the cell cycle of AML cells at the G1 stage and induced apoptosis. Decrease in protein and mRNA expression level of Wnt pathway-related molecules was confirmed by the analyses of western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, compound 31 combined with idarubicin synergistically inhibited the proliferation of AML cells. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that compound 31 has potential as a novel anti-AML agent targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.","['Wakabayashi, Ryosuke', 'Hattori, Yasunao', 'Hosogi, Shigekuni', 'Toda, Yuki', 'Takata, Kazuyuki', 'Ashihara, Eishi']","['Wakabayashi R', 'Hattori Y', 'Hosogi S', 'Toda Y', 'Takata K', 'Ashihara E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201218,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelogenous leukemia', '*Dipeptide type inhibitor', '*SURVIVIN', '*Wnt/beta-catenin pathway', '*c-MYC', '*beta-catenin']",2020/12/21 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/12/20 20:29'],"['2020/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/20 20:29 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(20)32199-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2021 Jan 8;535:73-79. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.027.

Our previous study showed (S)-erypoegin K selectively exhibits potent anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity against human leukemia HL-60 cells. To identify the target molecule of (S)-erypoegin K, we employed the human cancer cell panel analysis (termed JFCR39) coupled with a drug sensitivity database of pharmacologically well-characterized drugs for comparison using the COMPARE algorithm. (S)-erypoegin K exhibited a similar profile to that of etoposide, suggesting the molecular target for erypoegin K may be topoisomerase II (Topo II). Subsequent experiments using purified human Topo IIalpha established that the (S)-isomer selectively stabilizes the cleavage complex composed of double-stranded plasmid DNA and the enzyme. Moreover, (S)-erypoegin K inhibited decatenation of kinetoplast DNA. Molecular docking studies clearly indicated specific binding of the (S)-isomer to the active site of Topo IIalpha involving hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the cleavage complex. (S)-erypoegin K displayed potent cytotoxic activity against two human gastric cancer cells GCIY and MKN-1 with IC50 values of 0.270 and 0.327 muM, respectively, and induced enzyme activities of caspase 3 and 9. Cell cycle analysis showed marked cell cycle arrest at G2 phase in both cell lines. (S)-erypoegin K also displayed significant antitumor activity toward GCIY xenografted mice. The present study suggests (S)-erypoegin K acts as a Topo II inhibitor to block the G2/M transition of cancer cells.","['Hikita, Kiyomi', 'Yamakage, Yuko', 'Okunaga, Honoka', 'Motoyama, Yui', 'Matsuyama, Haruka', 'Matsuoka, Kenta', 'Murata, Tomiyasu', 'Nakayoshi, Tomoki', 'Oda, Akifumi', 'Kato, Kuniki', 'Tanaka, Hitoshi', 'Asao, Naoki', 'Dan, Shingo', 'Kaneda, Norio']","['Hikita K', 'Yamakage Y', 'Okunaga H', 'Motoyama Y', 'Matsuyama H', 'Matsuoka K', 'Murata T', 'Nakayoshi T', 'Oda A', 'Kato K', 'Tanaka H', 'Asao N', 'Dan S', 'Kaneda N']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201205,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antitumor agent', '*Erypoegin K', '*G2 cell cycle arrest', '*Human gastric cancer cells', '*JFCR39 panel assay', '*Topoisomerase II inhibitor']",2020/12/21 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/12/20 20:25'],"['2020/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/20 20:25 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(20)30734-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2020.115904 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2021 Jan 15;30:115904. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2020.115904.

One of the major metabolites isolated from Pulicaria undulata, 2alpha-hydroxyalantolactone (PU-1), has not been investigated in detail yet. Multidrug resistance (MDR) represents a major obstacle for cancer chemotherapy and the capability of novel natural products to overcoming MDR is of great interest. PURPOSE: Exploring the molecular modes of action for potent natural product metabolites. METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of PU-1 on sensitive and their corresponding drug-resistant cell lines (overexpressing P-glycoprotein, BCRP, ABCB5, DeltaEGFR, or TP53 knockout). Gene expression profiling was performed by transcriptome-wide mRNA microarray in the human CCRF-CEM leukemic cells after treatment with PU-1. The top significantly up- or down-regulated genes were identified by Chipster program and analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Finally, flow cytometry and Western blotting were performed for cell cycle analyses and apoptosis detection. RESULTS: The sesquiterpene lactone, PU-1, showed potent cytotoxicity towards the drug-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Transcriptome-wide mRNA expression profiling and pathway analysis pointed to genes involved in DNA damage response and G2/M cell cycle arrest. G2/M arrest was verified by flow cytometry and further confirmed by the upregulation of p21 and downregulation of p-CDC25C expression in Western blotting. Moreover, the suggested DNA damage checkpoint regulation was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting by upregulation of pS345 Chk1, p-H3 and gamma-H2AX. Furthermore, PU-1 inhibited PI3K/AKT pathway, which is involved in signaling DNA damage and G2/M arrest. Cells ultimately induced apoptosis upon PU-1 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PU-1 is a potent natural product inhibiting otherwise drug-resistant human tumor cell growth through DNA damage, G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","['Hegazy, Mohamed-Elamir F', 'Dawood, Mona', 'Mahmoud, Nuha', 'Elbadawi, Mohamed', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu', 'Klauck, Sabine M', 'Mohamed, Nagla', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Hegazy MF', 'Dawood M', 'Mahmoud N', 'Elbadawi M', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Klauck SM', 'Mohamed N', 'Efferth T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201117,Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['2alpha-Hydroxyalantolactone', 'Cytotoxicity', 'DNA damage', 'G2/M cell cycle arrest', 'Mode of action', 'Pulicaria undulata']",2020/12/21 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/12/20 20:21'],"['2020/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/20 20:21 [entrez]']","['S0944-7113(20)30240-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153409 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2021 Jan;81:153409. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153409.

Following immune attack, many tumors upregulate inhibitory ligands which bind to inhibitory receptors on T cells. For example, the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on activated T cells and its ligands (widely known as PD-L1) on a target tumor limits the efficacy of CAR T cells therapy against poorly responding tumors. Here, we use mesothelin (MSLN)-expressing human ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3) and human colon cancer cells (HCT116) to investigate whether PD-1-mediated T cell exhaustion affects the anti-tumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells. We utilized cell-intrinsic PD-1-targeting shRNA overexpression strategy, resulting in a significant PD-1 silencing in CAR T cells. The reduction of PD-1 expression on T cell surface strongly augmented CAR T cell cytokine production and cytotoxicity towards PD-L1-expressing cancer cells in vitro.

Cancer patients are frequently immunocompromised and subject to refractory infection and relapse of leukemia, due to the cytotoxic agents and immunosuppressive glucocorticoids in the chemotherapy regimens. Bu Shen Hui Yang Fang (BSHY), a traditional Chinese compound, was widely used in China to enhance the immune system of leukemia patients combined with chemotherapy and effectively lowered their risk of infection, with specific mechanism unknown yet. Thus, we investigated the effects of BSHY on the immune system using immunosuppressive mouse models. By analyzing the immune system of immunosuppressed BALB/C mice induced by hydrocortisone, we found an increase of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes in the spleens of mice after BSHY treatment. Furthermore, we found the enhanced immune system in BSHY treated group was due to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of lymphocytes. Cytokine array analysis revealed that interleukin 4 (IL-4) was reduced in the plasma of immunosuppressed mice but returned to a normal level after BSHY treatment. Moreover, we found IL-4 was an adverse prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia patients and part of them could be elevated by BSHY. Mechanistically, we found BSHY enhances the proliferation of lymphocytes in a Stat6-dependent manner. In summary, our current study demonstrates that BSHY enhances the proliferation of lymphocytes in the immunosuppressed mice via upregulating IL-4 signaling.","['Wang, Yajie', 'Tan, Jiabin', 'Hu, Peng', 'Pei, Qiang', 'Wen, Yan', 'Ma, Wenqing', 'Shi, Keqian', 'Li, Zengzheng', 'Li, Huiyuan', 'Cheng, Fengyu', 'Gu, Xuezhong', 'Yao, Xiangmei', 'Man, Yan', 'Zhao, Renbin', 'Feng, Shuai', 'Ding, Xiao', 'Yang, Tonghua']","['Wang Y', 'Tan J', 'Hu P', 'Pei Q', 'Wen Y', 'Ma W', 'Shi K', 'Li Z', 'Li H', 'Cheng F', 'Gu X', 'Yao X', 'Man Y', 'Zhao R', 'Feng S', 'Ding X', 'Yang T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201216,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Bu Shen Hui Yang Fang (BSHY)', 'Cytokine', 'IL-4', 'Immunoenhancement', 'Lymphocytes', 'Proliferation']",2020/12/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/12/19 20:16'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/19 20:16 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(20)31300-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2020.111107 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2021 Feb;134:111107. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2020.111107.

Laboratory findings that favor BL (e.g., surface expression of mu heavy chain and/or one of the light chains of immunoglobulin, FAB L3 morphology of blasts, MYC gene rearrangements) are not always present simultaneously. Our previous work demonstrated that BL differed from Ig(+) BCP-ALL by expression of Ig and other surface markers. In the current study, we have evaluated additional flow cytometric markers for reliable differentiation between BL and BCP-ALL. Among three studied surface antigens (CD44, CD38, CD58), only CD58 demonstrated significantly higher expression in BL as compared to BCP-ALL. Moreover, BL cases were associated with an increased level of Ki-67 and a higher percentage of cells in the S-phase of cell cycle. These two features reflect an aggressive proliferative potential of BL. Thus, when BL is suspected and results of surface Ig evaluation are controversial, the flow cytometric analysis of CD58, Ki-67 and cell cycle could assist in the differential diagnosis.","['Demina, Irina', 'Voropayev, Alexander', 'Semchenkova, Alexandra', 'Zerkalenkova, Elena', 'Olshanskaya, Yulia', 'Samochatova, Elena', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Miakova, Natalia', 'Maschan, Alexey', 'Popov, Alexander']","['Demina I', 'Voropayev A', 'Semchenkova A', 'Zerkalenkova E', 'Olshanskaya Y', 'Samochatova E', 'Novichkova G', 'Miakova N', 'Maschan A', 'Popov A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201208,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCP-ALL', '*Burkitt lymphoma', '*Differential diagnosis', '*Flow cytometry']",2020/12/20 06:00,2021/03/12 06:00,['2020/12/19 20:11'],"['2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/19 20:11 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(20)30196-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2020.106491 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2021 Jan;100:106491. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2020.106491.

However, investigations into the physiological roles of CCDC26 are rare. Previously, we reported that CCDC26 regulated proliferation and cell death of leukemia cells through KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase, by using K562 leukemia cells and their derivative CCDC26-knockdown (KD) cells. Here we propose a new role of CCDC26 in the differentiation of erythroid cells. We showed that expression of embryonic (epsilon- and zeta-) globins was markedly upregulated in CCDC26-KD cells compared with K562 control cells during hemin-induced differentiation. In contrast, expression of fetal-type gamma-globin, a major globin expressed in original K562 cells, was decreased. These changes in the expression of globin genes mainly took place at the transcriptional level, with significant suppression of transcription of adult (beta-, delta-) globins in CCDC26-KD cells. Re-introduction of exogenous CCDC26 into the CCDC26-KD cells recovered low-level expression of the embryonal globins. These results suggest CCDC26 has a role in switching transcription of globin genes in the differentiation of erythroid cells. The expression profile of the CCDC26-KD cells and control cells suggests FOG-2, a transcriptional modulator, as a candidate for a mediator of the CCDC26-associated regulation. We showed that both embryonic globins were transcriptionally activated in FOG-2-KD K562 cells. The KIT inhibitor ISCK03 suppressed the production of hemoglobin in K562 cells but did not affect transcription of globin genes. To summarize, FOG-2, but not KIT, is responsible for globin transcriptional regulation by CCDC26.","['Hirano, Tetsuo', 'Tsuruda, Tomomi', 'Tanaka, Yuka', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Yamazaki, Takeshi', 'Ishida, Atsuhiko']","['Hirano T', 'Tsuruda T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Harada H', 'Yamazaki T', 'Ishida A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201217,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Ultimately, these both result in the clonal overgrowth of blast cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and other tissues. As a consequence of this, normal hematopoietic stem cell function is severely hampered. Technologies allowing for the early detection of genetic alterations and understanding of these varied molecular pathologies have helped to advance our treatment regimens toward personalized targeted therapies. In spite of this, both AML and ALL continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, in part because molecular therapies for the plethora of genetic abnormalities have not been developed. This underscores the current need for better model systems for therapy development. This article reviews the current zebrafish models of AML and ALL and discusses how novel gene editing tools can be implemented to generate better models of acute leukemias.

The impact of FLT3 mutation clearance and the achievement of composite complete remission (CRc) and complete remission/complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CR/CRh) on overall survival (OS) in patients with FLT3(mut+) R/R AML treated with single-agent gilteritinib in a phase 1/2 trial were evaluated. Using next-generation sequencing, a FLT3-ITD variant allele frequency of </=10(-4) was used to define FLT3-ITD clearance in patients with no morphologic leukemia (ie, CRc). A total of 108 patients with FLT3-ITD-positive (FLT3-ITD+) R/R AML were analyzed; 95 of these patients had received >/=80-mg/day gilteritinib. Ten of the 95 patients had FLT3-ITD clearance; eight of these 10 patients achieved CRc and were considered negative for measurable residual disease. There was a trend toward longer OS in patients who attained CRc with FLT3-ITD clearance (131.4 weeks) versus those who achieved CRc and did not have FLT3-ITD clearance (n = 41; 43.3 weeks; HR = 0.416; p = 0.066). Among patients treated with >/=80-mg/day gilteritinib who achieved CR/CRh (n = 24), seven had FLT3-ITD clearance. Among patients who received 120-mg/day gilteritinib, those who achieved CR/CRh had a longer median OS (70.6 weeks) and higher 52-week survival probability (66.7%) than patients who did not achieve CR/CRh (n = 71; median OS, 41.7 weeks; 52-week survival probability, 20.2%). Overall, these data suggest that gilteritinib can induce deep molecular responses in patients with FLT3-ITD+ R/R AML, and in the setting of CRc or CR/CRh, these responses may be associated with prolonged survival.","['Altman, Jessica K', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Hill, Jason E', 'Rosales, Matt', 'Bahceci, Erkut', 'Levis, Mark J']","['Altman JK', 'Perl AE', 'Hill JE', 'Rosales M', 'Bahceci E', 'Levis MJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201219,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3 inhibitor', '*Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3', '*internal tandem duplication', '*morphologic remission']",2020/12/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/12/19 08:36'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/19 08:36 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3652 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2021 Feb;10(3):797-805. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3652.

Our objective is to study the impact of a comprehensive geriatric assessment on hematological treatment decision in older patients and the factors associated with change in treatment plan. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of patients aged 65 years and above with hematological malignancies, hospitalized between 2008 and 2019 at the University Cancer Institute of Toulouse. They were assessed by a geriatrician/nurse team using a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). A penalized logistic regression model with elastic net regularization was used to identify factors associated with change in hematological treatment plan. RESULTS: A total of 424 patients were included. Main hematological malignancies were lymphoma (36.1 %), acute myeloid leukemia (26.9 %) and myelodysplastic syndrome (19.8%). Change in hematological treatment plan was suggested after CGA for 92 patients (21.7%). Factors associated with change in treatment plan were functional impairment according to ADL and IADL scale, mobility impairment, the presence of comorbidity defined by the Charlson score >1 and increasing age. CONCLUSION: A CGA has a significant impact on hematological treatment decision in older patients. Functional and mobility impairment, comorbidities and age are predictive factors of change in treatment plan.","['Garric, Marie', 'Sourdet, Sandrine', 'Cabarrou, Bastien', 'Steinmeyer, Zara', 'Gauthier, Martin', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Gerard, Stephane', 'Lozano, Stephanie', 'Brechemier, Delphine', 'Filleron, Thomas', 'Mourey, Loic', 'Balardy, Laurent']","['Garric M', 'Sourdet S', 'Cabarrou B', 'Steinmeyer Z', 'Gauthier M', 'Ysebaert L', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Gerard S', 'Lozano S', 'Brechemier D', 'Filleron T', 'Mourey L', 'Balardy L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4551-6620'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210214,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['geriatric assessment', 'hematological malignancies', 'older patients', 'oncogeriatric']",2020/12/20 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/19 08:35'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/19 08:35 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13570 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 May;106(5):616-626. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13570.

Although many murine studies of Dectin-1 have been performed, its human analog has not been studied well in terms of being a drug delivery target. We thus analyzed human Dectin-1 cDNA obtained from chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived cells, CML-1, and confirmed the findings of previous studies that there are many isoforms of human Dectin-1 due to exon skipping, although murine Dectin-1 has only two forms. When we transfected the Dectin-1 gene into a non-Dectin-1-expressing cell line and examined cellular uptake of the antisense DNA/beta-glucan complex, we confirmed that expression of the target gene was effectively suppressed through beta-glucan/Dectin-1-mediated uptake. The present results suggest that the beta-glucan complex would be an effective tool to deliver antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) to Dectin-1-expressing cells not only for mice but also for humans.","['Fujiwara, Nobuaki', 'Izumi, Hiroto', 'Kira, Ryoma', 'Morimoto, Yasuo', 'Mochizuki, Shinichi', 'Sakurai, Kazuo']","['Fujiwara N', 'Izumi H', 'Kira R', 'Morimoto Y', 'Mochizuki S', 'Sakurai K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201213,Netherlands,Carbohydr Res,Carbohydrate research,0043535,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Active-targeting delivery', 'Antisense', 'Dectin-1', 'Immunocyte', 'Schizophyllan']",2020/12/20 06:00,2021/10/06 06:00,['2020/12/19 05:20'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/19 05:20 [entrez]']","['S0008-6215(20)30590-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.carres.2020.108219 [doi]']",ppublish,Carbohydr Res. 2021 Feb;500:108219. doi: 10.1016/j.carres.2020.108219.

Sequence variants in genes coding for TLR4, MBL, and IL-1Ra were investigated in relation to clinical utility of identifying severe episodes of febrile neutropenia (FN) in a cohort of children undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The study included 122 children, where data on FN and microbiological findings were retrospectively collected from medical records. Sequence variants in genes coding for MBL, TLR4, and IL-1Ra were identified by pyrosequencing, TaqMan SNP genotyping assay, and gel electrophoresis. A total of 380 episodes of FN were identified and in 139 episodes, there was a microbiological defined infection. Age and treatment intensity were all associated with the risk of developing FN. No sequence variant was associated to increased numbers of FN episodes. Two sequence variants in the TLR4 gene increased the risk of viral infection, whilst sequence variants in the IL-1Ra gene were associated to a decreased risk of bacterial blood-stream infection (BSI). The investigated sequence variants did not associate with increased risk for FN or to severe infections, as to why the clinical utility as a risk-stratification tool is low. Most episodes of FN were classified as fever with unknown origin, emphasizing the need for improved microbial detection methods.","['Wahlund, Martina', 'Lindqvist Appell, Malin', 'Hed Myrberg, Ida', 'Berggren, Anna', 'Nilsson, Anna']","['Wahlund M', 'Lindqvist Appell M', 'Hed Myrberg I', 'Berggren A', 'Nilsson A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2809-7591', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8297-2238', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5885-7101']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201216,Switzerland,Children (Basel),"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",101648936,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-1Ra', 'MBL', 'TLR4', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'febrile neutropenia']",2020/12/20 06:00,2020/12/20 06:01,['2020/12/19 01:02'],"['2020/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/20 06:01 [medline]']","['children7120296 [pii]', '10.3390/children7120296 [doi]']",epublish,Children (Basel). 2020 Dec 16;7(12). pii: children7120296. doi: 10.3390/children7120296.,,,"['Department of Medicine Solna, Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institutet, 171 64 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, 171 64 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Division of Drug Research, Linkoping University, 581 83 Linkoping, Sweden.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65 Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Medicine Solna, Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institutet, 171 64 Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65 Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, 171 64 Stockholm, Sweden.""]",,,,,"['NA/Barncancerfonden', 'NA/Svenska Lakaresallskapet']",PMC7766164,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The upregulated activity of these proteins is linked to the development of disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders (ND) and cancer. Although various chemical inhibitors of these enzymes restore the brain functions in models of ND such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and reduce the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, the particular contribution of each paralog to these effects remains unclear as these molecules downregulate the activity of both paralogs with a similar efficacy. Moreover, given that GSK3 paralogs phosphorylate more than 100 substrates, the simultaneous inhibition of both enzymes has detrimental effects during long-term inhibition. Although the GSK3beta kinase function has usually been taken as the global GSK3 activity, in the last few years, a growing interest in the study of GSK3alpha has emerged because several studies have recognized it as the main GSK3 paralog involved in a variety of diseases. This review summarizes the current biological evidence on the role of GSK3alpha in AD and various types of cancer. We also provide a discussion on some strategies that may lead to the design of the paralog-specific inhibition of GSK3alpha.","['Silva-Garcia, Octavio', 'Cortes-Vieyra, Ricarda', 'Mendoza-Ambrosio, Francisco N', 'Ramirez-Galicia, Guillermo', 'Baizabal-Aguirre, Victor M']","['Silva-Garcia O', 'Cortes-Vieyra R', 'Mendoza-Ambrosio FN', 'Ramirez-Galicia G', 'Baizabal-Aguirre VM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201216,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,IM,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Alzheimer's disease"", '*GSK3', '*GSK3 structure', '*GSK3alpha', '*GSK3beta', '*cancer']",2020/12/20 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2020/12/19 01:01'],"['2020/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10121683 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10121683 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Dec 16;10(12). pii: biom10121683. doi: 10.3390/biom10121683.,20210913,,"['Departamento de Quimica Teorica, Universidad del Papaloapan, Oaxaca 68301, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Michoacan, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Michoacan 58000, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Quimica Teorica, Universidad del Papaloapan, Oaxaca 68301, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Quimica Teorica, Universidad del Papaloapan, Oaxaca 68301, Mexico.', 'Centro Multidisciplinario de Estudios en Biotecnologia, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo, Michoacan 58893, Mexico.']","['EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha)']","['Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/enzymology', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Male', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,PMC7765659,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with HAM/TSP exhibit significant changes in their immune response, and HTLV-1 infection can interfere in cytokine production and perhaps in T cell production. The aims of this study were to evaluate thymic function in HAM/TSP patients and HTLV-1 healthy carriers (HCs) and correlate it to age and interleukin 7 (IL-7) gene expression. Thymic function in 21 HAM/TSP patients and 12 HCs was evaluated by quantifying T cell receptor rearrangement excision circle (TREC) particles and IL-7 gene expression, both measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HAM/TSP patients presented lower TREC particle counts (p = 0.0112) and lower IL-7 expression (p = 0.0102) than HCs. Both TREC particles and IL-7 gene expression were separately analyzed in two age groups: </= 59 years and >/=60 years, The </=59-year-old HAM/TSP patients had a lower TREC count compared with the </=59-year-old HCs (p = 0.0476). In conclusion, HAM/TSP development could interfere with thymic function because the results showed TREC particle reduction in HAM/TSP patients in relation to HCs, and it could be associated with a concomitant reduction in IL-7 expression.","['Gomes, Jessica Antonia Nunes', 'da Silva Dias, George Alberto', 'Fujihara, Satomi', 'Yoshikawa, Gilberto Toshimitsu', 'Koyama, Roberta Vilela Lopes', 'Sousa, Rita Catarina Medeiros', 'Quaresma, Juarez Antonio Simoes', 'Fuzii, Hellen Thais']","['Gomes JAN', 'da Silva Dias GA', 'Fujihara S', 'Yoshikawa GT', 'Koyama RVL', 'Sousa RCM', 'Quaresma JAS', 'Fuzii HT']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201203,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*Thymic function']",2020/12/19 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2020/12/18 20:17'],"['2020/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 20:17 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(20)30572-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2020.152050 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2021 Jan;226(1):152050. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2020.152050.

Nowadays, developing selective CDK9 inhibitors has been extremely challenging as its ATP-binding sites are similar with other CDKs. Here, we report that the CDK9 inhibitor BAY-1143572 is converted into a series of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) which leads to several compounds inducing the degradation of CDK9 in acute myeloid leukemia cells at a low nanomolar concentration. In addition, the most potent PROTAC molecule B03 could inhibit cell growth more effectively than warhead alone, with little inhibition of other kinases. This enhanced antiproliferative activity is mediated by a slight increase in kinase inhibitory activity and an increase in the level of apoptosis induction. Moreover, B03 could induce the degradation of CDK9 in vivo. Our work provides evidence that B03 represents a lead for further development and that CDK9 degradation is a potential valuable therapeutic strategy in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Qiu, Xiaqiu', 'Li, Yuanqing', 'Yu, Bin', 'Ren, Jie', 'Huang, Huidan', 'Wang, Min', 'Ding, Hong', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Wang, Jubo', 'Bian, Jinlei']","['Qiu X', 'Li Y', 'Yu B', 'Ren J', 'Huang H', 'Wang M', 'Ding H', 'Li Z', 'Wang J', 'Bian J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Antitumor', 'CDK9', 'Degrader', 'PROTAC']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/12/18 20:14'],"['2020/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 20:14 [entrez]']","['S0223-5234(20)31063-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.113091 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2021 Feb 5;211:113091. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.113091.

Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) could promote Ras/MAPK activation by integrating growth factor signals. Thus, SHP2 inhibitors had become a hot topic in the treatment of cancer. SHP2(F285S), mutation in SHP2, was detected in leukemia variants. The compound 2 (3-benzyl-8-chloro-2-hydroxy-4H-benzo[4,5]thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one) had been reported that it was a potent allosteric inhibitor of both SHP2 wild type (SHP2(WT)) and the F285S mutant (SHP2(F285S)). However, the mechanism of inhibition remained to be further discovered. Herein, molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation were performed to explain the inhibition mechanism of compound 2 on SHP2(WT) and SHP2(F285S). Overall, the molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 2 maintained the ""close"" structure of SHP2 protein probably by locking the C-SH2 and PTP domain. Next, post-analysis demonstrated that compound 2 might make TYR66-GLU76 of D'E-loop in N-SH2 and GLU258-LYS266 of B'C-loop, HIS458-ARG465 of P-loop, VAL497-THR507 of Q-loop in PTP domain regions tightly connect and much easier maintain ""self-inhibited"" conformation of SHP2(F285S-compound2) than that of SHP2(WT-compound2). Importantly, GLU76 of D'E-loop could play a vital role in inhibition of SHP2(WT-compound2) and SHP2(F285S-compound2). This work provided a reliable clue to develop novel inhibitors for leukemia related to SHP2(F285S).","['Zhou, Liang', 'Feng, Yong', 'Ma, Yang-Chun', 'Zhang, Zhao', 'Wu, Jing-Wei', 'Du, Shan', 'Li, Wei-Ya', 'Lu, Xin-Hua', 'Ma, Ying', 'Wang, Run-Ling']","['Zhou L', 'Feng Y', 'Ma YC', 'Zhang Z', 'Wu JW', 'Du S', 'Li WY', 'Lu XH', 'Ma Y', 'Wang RL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201203,United States,J Mol Graph Model,Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,9716237,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allosteric inhibitor', '*Cancer', '*Molecular docking', '*Molecular dynamic simulation', '*Post-analysis', '*SHP2(F285S)', '*SHP2(WT)']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/18 20:14'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 20:14 [entrez]']","['S1093-3263(20)30596-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmgm.2020.107807 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Graph Model. 2021 Mar;103:107807. doi: 10.1016/j.jmgm.2020.107807.

In the human genome, several have been found to originate from retroviruses, and some of which are involved in the progression of various cancers. Hence, to investigate whether retroviral-like genes are associated with AML development, we conducted a transcriptome sequencing analysis of 12 retroviral-like genes of 150 AML patients and 32 healthy donor samples, of which RNA sequencing data were obtained from public databases. We found high expression of ERV3-1, an envelope gene of endogenous retrovirus group 3 member 1, in all AML patients examined in this study. In particular, blood and bone marrow cells of the myeloid lineage in AML patients, exhibited higher expression of ERV3-1 than those of the monocytic AML lineage. We also examined the protein expression of ERV3-1 by immunohistochemical analysis and found expression of the ERV3-1 protein in all 12 myeloid-phenotype patients and 7 out of 12 monocytic-phenotype patients, with a particular concentration observed at the membrane of some leukemic cells. Transcriptome analysis further suggested that upregulated ERV3-1 expression may be associated with chromosome 8 trisomy as anomaly was found to be more common among the high expression group than the low expression group. However, this finding was not corroborated by the immunohistochemical data. This discrepancy may have been caused, in part, by the small number of samples analyzed in this study. Although the precise associated molecular mechanisms remain unclear, our results suggest that ERV3-1 may be involved in AML development.","['Nakagawa, So', 'Kawashima, Masaharu', 'Miyatake, Yuji', 'Kudo, Kai', 'Kotaki, Ryutaro', 'Ando, Kiyoshi', 'Kotani, Ai']","['Nakagawa S', 'Kawashima M', 'Miyatake Y', 'Kudo K', 'Kotaki R', 'Ando K', 'Kotani A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201216,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'Cancer development', 'Endogenous retrovirus', 'Envelope', 'Immunosuppression']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/12/18 20:09'],"['2020/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 20:09 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(20)31032-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2020.145363 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2021 Mar 20;773:145363. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2020.145363.

As a germline disorder, why the hematopoietic hierarchy is specifically affected is not fully understood. We find that reprogramming transcription during hematopoietic differentiation results in an overload of genotoxic stress, which causes aborted differentiation and depletion of FA mutant progenitor cells. DNA damage onset most likely arises from formaldehyde, an obligate by-product of oxidative protein demethylation during transcription regulation. Our results demonstrate that rapid and extensive transcription reprogramming associated with hematopoietic differentiation poses a major threat to genome stability and cell viability in the absence of the FA pathway. The connection between differentiation and DNA damage accumulation reveals a novel mechanism of genome scarring and is critical to exploring therapies to counteract the aplastic anemia for the treatment of FA patients.","['Shen, Xi', 'Wang, Rui', 'Kim, Moon Jong', 'Hu, Qianghua', 'Hsu, Chih-Chao', 'Yao, Jun', 'Klages-Mundt, Naeh', 'Tian, Yanyan', 'Lynn, Erica', 'Brewer, Thomas F', 'Zhang, Yilei', 'Arun, Banu', 'Gan, Boyi', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Takeda, Shunichi', 'Chen, Junjie', 'Park, Jae-Il', 'Shi, Xiaobing', 'Chang, Christopher J', 'Jung, Sung Yun', 'Qin, Jun', 'Li, Lei']","['Shen X', 'Wang R', 'Kim MJ', 'Hu Q', 'Hsu CC', 'Yao J', 'Klages-Mundt N', 'Tian Y', 'Lynn E', 'Brewer TF', 'Zhang Y', 'Arun B', 'Gan B', 'Andreeff M', 'Takeda S', 'Chen J', 'Park JI', 'Shi X', 'Chang CJ', 'Jung SY', 'Qin J', 'Li L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA damage', '*Fanconi anemia', '*bone marrow failure', '*differentiation', '*formaldehyde', '*hematopoiesis', '*transcription reprogramming']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/01/16 06:00,['2020/12/18 20:08'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 20:08 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1097-2765(20)30840-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2020.11.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2020 Dec 17;80(6):1013-1024.e6. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.11.040.,20210115,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The role of metabolic imaging with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) has been increasingly recognized in optimizing the diagnosis of invasive infection, monitoring the response to therapy and guiding the duration of antimicrobial therapy or need to escalate to surgical intervention. METHODS: Two distinct cases of pulmonary co-infection of rare fungal and bacterial pathogens are explored in severely immunocompromised individuals where FDG PET/CT aided both patients to make a full recovery and transition to HCT. The first case explores mixed Scedosporium apiospermum and Rhizomucor pulmonary infection on a background of T cell/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia ultimately warranting long-term antifungal therapy and lobectomy prior to HCT. The second case explores Fusarium and Nocardia pulmonary infection on a background of relapsed AML also warranting surgical resection with lobectomy and long-term antimicrobials prior to transition to HCT. DISCUSSION: The cases highlight the utility of FDG PET/CT to support the diagnosis of infections, including the presence or absence of disseminated infection, and to provide highly sensitive monitoring of the infection over time. FDG PET/CT played a key role in directing therapy duration decisions and prompted the necessity for surgical intervention. Ultimately, the use of FDG PET/CT allowed for a successful transition to HCT highlighting its value in this clinical setting. CONCLUSION: FDG PET/CT has an emerging role in the diagnostic and monitoring pathway for complex infections in high-risk immunocompromised patients.","['Longhitano, Anthony', 'Alipour, Ramin', 'Khot, Amit', 'Bajel, Ashish', 'Antippa, Phillip', 'Slavin, Monica', 'Thursky, Karin']","['Longhitano A', 'Alipour R', 'Khot A', 'Bajel A', 'Antippa P', 'Slavin M', 'Thursky K']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1597-2083'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201228,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['FDG PET/CT', 'fusarium', 'hematopoietic cell transplant', 'invasive fungal infection', 'mucormycosis', 'nocardia', 'opportunistic infection', 'scedosporium']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/12/18 17:12'],"['2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.13547 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2021 Jun;23(3):e13547. doi: 10.1111/tid.13547.

Although the prognostic value of BCR-ABL1 isoforms in Ph+ ALL patients has been investigated in numerous studies in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era, the results were still conflicting. Hence we performed herein the meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the impact of BCR-ABL1 isoforms on the clinical outcomes of Ph+ ALL patients. Systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases with the data access date up to June 15, 2020. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with fixed-effects or random-effects models. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the associations. Nine studies with a total number of 1582 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. Combined HRs suggested that p210 was slightly associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS) (HR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.05-1.72). The overall survival (OS) was not significantly affected (HR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.92-1.45). In subgroup analyses, the HRs showed a trend toward adverse impact of p210 on clinical outcomes. However, the confidence intervals were not crossing the null value only in a minority of subgroups including Caucasian studies, first-generation TKI treated cohort and transplant cohort. Our findings suggested that p210 might pose a mild adverse impact on the EFS of Ph+ ALL patients. This effect might be compromised by the use of second- or third-generation TKIs.

We analyzed immunophenotyping and hematological findings, as the risk of relapse, of pediatric ALL patients at diagnosis and relapse. METHODS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 30 pediatric ALL patients were collected at diagnosis and at relapse. The latter was evaluated for immunophenotyping and cytochemical staining (Periodic Acid Schiff stain (PAS)), while hematological findings were assessed in the former one. RESULTS: The percentage of PAS-positive patients, TdT, and CD4 expression were significantly higher at diagnosis than relapse (p = 0.027, 0.004, and 0.043, respectively), whereas the platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were significantly lower at diagnosis (p = 0.004 and 0.032, respectively). There were correla-tions between immunophenotyping and hematology data, including: a) a negative correlation between CD4 expression with blast percentage (r = -0.927, p = 0.003) and hemoglobin level (r = -0.991, p < 0.001) at diagnosis and TdT expression with platelet count (r = -0.441, p = 0.017) at relapse, and b) a positive correlation between CD3 expression with PLR (r = 0.367, p = 0.046) at relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that changes in immunophenotyping and hematology findings could be applied as relapse prognostic factors in ALL.","['Gatavizadeh, Zahra', 'Faranoush, Mohammad', 'Shokouhian, Mohammad', 'Azad, Vahid F', 'Saki, Najmaldin', 'Mousavei, Somaieh', 'Bagheri, Marziye']","['Gatavizadeh Z', 'Faranoush M', 'Shokouhian M', 'Azad VF', 'Saki N', 'Mousavei S', 'Bagheri M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,IM,,,2020/12/19 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/12/18 16:32'],"['2020/12/18 16:32 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200340 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2020 Dec 1;66(12). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200340.,20210527,,,,"['Child', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the published significance of this molecular biomarker, routine monitoring for mutant NPM1 levels has not been widely adopted in academic clinical laboratories. Therefore, our objective was to validate a quantitative, reverse transcription-PCR assay for the detection of NPM1 Type A mutant transcripts for use in the clinical laboratory. METHODS: A quantitative, real-time, reverse-transcription PCR-based method for the detection of NPM1 Type A mutant transcripts was validated for use in routine clinical practice. Results from this assay were compared to results from orthogonal methods, including next generation sequencing and digital droplet PCR. RESULTS: This real-time, reverse-transcription PCR-based method is sensitive (limit of detection: 0.0150% NCN and reproducible (</= 0.5 log10-fold variation). We summarize the rigorous validation results and share observations that will help other clinical laboratories that may wish to implement this testing. We show the superior sensitivity of this assay compared to other assays (e.g., 45 gene Myeloid Next Generation Sequencing panel) and present a representative case which highlights the assay's utility in the pathologic assessment of cases with borderline morphologic or flow cytometric findings. CONCLUSIONS: As molecular testing for residual disease in AML continues to expand, this sensitive and reproducible method will be an appropriate testing option for the detection of NPM1 Type A mutant transcripts in clinical practice.","['Racchumi, Joelle', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Kluk, Michael J']","['Racchumi J', 'Tam W', 'Kluk MJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,IM,,,2020/12/19 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/12/18 16:32'],"['2020/12/18 16:32 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200104 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2020 Dec 1;66(12). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200104.,20210527,,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']","['Humans', 'Laboratories', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review we summarise the recent findings in the field of epitranscriptomics related to m6A and its relevance in AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have focused on the role of m6A regulators in the development of AML and their potential as translational targets. The writer Methyltransferase Like 3 and its binding partner Methyltransferase Like 14, as well as the reader YTH domain-containing family protein 2, were shown to be vital for LSC survival, and their loss has detrimental effects on AML cells. Similar observations were made with the demethylases fat mass and obesity-associated protein and AlkB homologue 5 RNA demethylase. Of importance, loss of any of these genes has little to no effect on normal hemopoietic stem cells, suggesting therapeutic potential. SUMMARY: The field of epitranscriptomics is still in its infancy and the importance of m6A and other RNA-modifications in AML will only come into sharper focus. The development of therapeutics targeting RNA-modifying enzymes may open up new avenues for treatment of such malignancies.","['Yankova, Eliza', 'Aspris, Demetrios', 'Tzelepis, Konstantinos']","['Yankova E', 'Aspris D', 'Tzelepis K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,,2020/12/19 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2020/12/18 13:14'],"['2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 13:14 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000636 [doi]', '00062752-202103000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2021 Mar 1;28(2):80-85. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000636.,20210810,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Histone modifying enzymes and large multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complexes and their cell type-specific plasticity remain the central defining features of gene regulation and establishment of tissue identity. Modulation of transcription factor expression gradient ex vivo and concomitant flexibility of higher order chromatin architecture in response to signaling cues are exciting approaches to regulate MSC activity and tissue rejuvenation. Being an important constituent of the adult bone marrow microenvironment/niche, pathophysiological perturbation in MSC homeostasis also causes impaired hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell function in a non-cell autonomous mechanism. In addition, pluripotent MSCs can function as immune regulatory cells, and they reside at the crossroad of innate and adaptive immune response pathways. Research in the past few years suggest that MSCs/stromal fibroblasts significantly contribute to the establishment of immunosuppressive microenvironment in shaping antitumor immunity. Therefore, it is important to understand mesenchymal stromal epigenome and transcriptional regulation to leverage its applications in regenerative medicine, epigenetic memory-guided trained immunity, immune-metabolic rewiring, and precision immune reprogramming. In this review, we highlight the latest developments and prospects in chromatin biology in determining MSC function in the context of lineage commitment and immunomodulation.","['Chakraborty, Sayan', 'Sinha, Sayantani', 'Sengupta, Amitava']","['Chakraborty S', 'Sinha S', 'Sengupta A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2804-1774'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cell differentiation', '*chromatin remodeling', '*epigenetics', '*gene regulation', '*hematopoiesis', '*inflammation', '*innate immunity', '*mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)', '*tumor microenvironment']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/12/18 12:13'],"['2020/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 12:13 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1096/fj.202002232R [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2021 Jan;35(1):e21234. doi: 10.1096/fj.202002232R.,20210615,['(c) 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['Stem Cell & Leukemia Laboratory, Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Translational Research Unit of Excellence (TRUE), Kolkata, India.', 'Stem Cell & Leukemia Laboratory, Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Translational Research Unit of Excellence (TRUE), Kolkata, India.', 'Stem Cell & Leukemia Laboratory, Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.', 'Translational Research Unit of Excellence (TRUE), Kolkata, India.']",['0 (Histones)'],"['Animals', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Histones/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*immunology', 'Stem Cell Niche/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renewed interest has occurred in part due to widespread adoption of next-generation sequencing panels that help render the diagnosis in the absence of morphologic dysplasia. Although most CMML patients exhibit somatic mutations in epigenetic modifiers, spliceosome components, transcription factors and signal transduction genes, it is increasingly clear that a small subset harbors an inherited predisposition to CMML and other myeloid neoplasms. More intriguing is the fact that the mutational spectrum observed in CMML is found in other types of myeloid leukemias, begging the question of how similar genetic backgrounds can lead to such divergent clinical phenotypes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CLL patients who received treatment in our hospital were enrolled in this study as the disease group. Meanwhile, healthy subjects were taken as the control group. Peripheral blood samples were collected to detect TP53 gene polymorphisms at rs8068934 and rs218698, and the haplotype analysis was performed. The expression of TP53 was detected via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, the survival conditions were analyzed. RESULTS: The allele distribution at rs8068934 (p=0.046) and rs218698 (p=0.028) of TP53 gene was different between control group and disease group. A allele frequency at rs8068934 and T allele frequency at rs218698 were significantly higher in disease group (p<0.05). The genotype distribution at rs218698 of TP53 gene in disease group was also different from that in control group (p=0.038). The results demonstrated that CC genotype frequency in disease group was significantly lower than that in control group (p<0.05). Besides, the distribution of dominant model at rs8068934 (p=0.042) and recessive model at rs218698 (p=0.033) in disease group exhibited remarkable differences from control group, in which AA+AG frequency (dominant model) at rs8068934 and CC+CT frequency (recessive model) at rs218698 in disease group were significantly higher. Meanwhile, the distribution of AT (p=0.029) and GC (p=0.007) haplotypes at rs8068934 and rs218698 in disease group was evidently different from that in control group. The results indicated that disease group showed significantly higher frequency of AT haplotype and lower frequency of GC haplotype (p<0.05). Moreover, TP53 gene polymorphisms at rs8068934 were significantly associated with the levels of white blood cells (WBC) (p=0.000) and platelets (PLT) (p=0.035). Patients with GG genotype had significantly higher level of WBC, while those with AG genotype showed significantly lower level of PLT (p<0.05). TP53 gene polymorphisms at rs218698 were associated with the level of red blood cells (RBC) (p=0.000). Patients with CT genotype had a remarkably lower level of RBC (p<0.05). There were significant correlations of TP53 gene polymorphisms at rs8068934 (p=0.000) and rs218698 (p=0.000) with the expression of TP53. The expression of TP53 was lower in people with AA genotype at rs8068934 but higher in people with TT genotype at rs218698 (p<0.05).

The therapeutic effect of the mercaptopurine limits its severe side effects like other cytotoxic (anti-cancer) drugs. Nanostructures or nanoparticles can be widely used as potential drug carriers for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In the current study, the boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) and carbon nanotube (CNT) were studied as the delivery carriers of MCP using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation studies. To further understand the electronic properties of mercaptopurine, the partial density of states (PDOS) was calculated. The PDOS results depicted that the electronic features of the MCP do not change after the adsorption on the surface of the nanotubes. More stability of the MCP/BNNT complexes may be attributed to the existence of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between the hydrogen atoms of the MCP molecule and the N atoms of the BNNT. The results of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) confirmed the presence of H-bonds in these complexes. Moreover, MD simulation studies were done in the presence of five drug molecules. The results revealed that the strongest van der Waals (vdW) interaction energy was found between the BNNT and MCP among the studied nanotubes, indicating the BNNT is a better nanocarrier than carbon nanotube for delivery of the MCP drug within the biological systems. In general, the obtained results may present helpful information on the nature of the interactions between mercaptopurine anticancer drug with BNNT and/or CNT.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases by decitabine (DAC) can demethylate and activate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. Epigenetic therapy using DAC should be an attractive strategy for lung cancer therapy. FBW7 is a tumor suppressor that functions as an Mcl-1 E3 ligase to degrade Mcl-1 by ubiquitination. Here we discovered that treatment of various human lung cancer cells with DAC resulted in activation of FBW7 expression, decreased levels of Mcl-1 protein, and growth inhibition. DAC-activated FBW7 expression promoted Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation leading to a significant reduction in the half-life of Mcl-1 protein. Mechanistically, treatment of lung cancer cells or lung cancer xenografts with DAC induced the conversion of the FBW7 gene from a methylated form to an unmethylated form, which was associated with the increased expression of FBW7 and decreased expression of Mcl-1 in vitro and in vivo. DAC suppressed lung cancer growth in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. Combined treatment with DAC and a Bcl2 inhibitor, venetoclax, exhibited strong synergistic potency against lung cancer without normal tissue toxicity. These findings uncover a novel mechanism by which DAC suppresses tumor growth by targeting the FBW7/Mcl-1 signaling pathway. Combination of DAC with Bcl2 inhibitor venetoclax provides more effective epigenetic therapy for lung cancer.","['Kim, Mi Jeong', 'Chen, Guo', 'Sica, Gabriel L', 'Deng, Xingming']","['Kim MJ', 'Chen G', 'Sica GL', 'Deng X']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201218,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl2 inhibitor', '*Epigenetic therapy', '*FBW7', '*Mcl-1', '*decitabine', '*demethylation', '*lung cancer', '*ubiquitination']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/18 08:36'],"['2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 08:36 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2020.1856756 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2021 Jan 2;22(1):55-65. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2020.1856756.

Carfilzomib, a second-generation proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, shows efficacy against osteosarcoma. However, drug resistance remains a major challenge. What is the role of carfilzomib-induced changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to the proapoptotic effects of the drug? What is the main finding and its importance? The dose-dependent antiapoptotic effects in osteosarcoma are associated with activation of MAPK signalling. Combinational targeting of MAPK signalling pathways can synergistically enhance carfilzomib-induced cell apoptosis, suggesting that MAPK inhibitors in combination with proteasome inhibitors can serve as a novel therapeutic tool for osteosarcoma. ABSTRACT: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy. Despite efforts to improve outcomes, the overall survival rates for osteosarcoma have remained unchanged over the past three decades. In this study, we assessed the proapoptotic effects of the second-generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib on osteosarcoma and investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the synergistic proapoptotic action when combined with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors. We found that carfilzomib alone significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, characterized by the induction of cleaved caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. More importantly, focusing on the changes of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members and signalling pathways, we found a striking induction of myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl-1) and the activation of MAPK pathways. Furthermore, we observed that combinational targeting of the MAPK pathways using the specific inhibitors U0126, SP600125 or SB203580 synergistically enhanced carfilzomib-induced cell apoptosis. Notably, we found that the combinational inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAPK pathways significantly decreased the expression of the three antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, and in particular this reversed induction of Mcl-1 by carfilzomib. Collectively, our findings show that activation of the MAPK pathways contributes to the mechanisms of drug resistance to carfilzomib. In addition, the synergistic proapoptotic action of MAPK and proteasome inhibitors in osteosarcoma cells suggests that combinational therapy with both drug types may serve as a novel strategy for the clinical management of osteosarcoma.","['Lei, Li', 'Zhang, Yuchen', 'Jian, Qiang', 'Lei, Lei', 'Lv, Nan', 'Williamson, Ramone A', 'Chen, Ping', 'Zhang, Dan', 'Hu, Jinsong']","['Lei L', 'Zhang Y', 'Jian Q', 'Lei L', 'Lv N', 'Williamson RA', 'Chen P', 'Zhang D', 'Hu J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4794-8523', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0565-4567']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201217,England,Exp Physiol,Experimental physiology,9002940,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*MAPK', '*apoptosis', '*carfilzomib', '*osteosarcoma', '*synergy']",2020/12/19 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2020/12/18 05:58'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 05:58 [entrez]']",['10.1113/EP088762 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Physiol. 2021 Feb;106(2):438-449. doi: 10.1113/EP088762.

Despite new targeted therapies such as ibrutinib and venetoclax, disease progression and relapse remain an issue. CLL cell interactions with the supportive tissue microenvironment play a critical role in disease pathogenesis. We used a platform for drug discovery based on systems biology and artificial intelligence, to identify drugs targeting key proteins described to have a role in the microenvironment. The selected compounds were screened in CLL cell lines in the presence of stromal cells to mimic the microenvironment and validated the best candidates in primary CLL cells. Our results showed that the commercial drug simvastatin was the most effective and selective out of the tested compounds. Simvastatin decreased CLL cell survival and proliferation as well as cell adhesion. Importantly, this drug enhanced the antitumor effect of venetoclax and ibrutinib. We proposed that systems biology approaches combined with pharmacological screening could help to find new drugs for CLL treatment and to predict new combinations with current therapies. Our results highlight the possibility of repurposing widely used drugs such as statins to target the microenvironment and to improve the efficacy of ibrutinib or venetoclax in CLL cells.","['Gimenez,

Despite this, very little improvement in survival rates has been achieved over the past few decades. This is partially due to the heterogeneity of AML and the need for more targeted therapeutics than the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies that have been a mainstay in therapy for the past 50 years. In the past 20 years, research has been diversifying the approach to treating AML by investigating molecular pathways uniquely relevant to AML cell proliferation and survival. Here we review the development of novel therapeutics in targeting apoptosis, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, hedgehog (HH) pathway, mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and c-Myc signaling. There has been an impressive effort into better understanding the diversity of AML cell characteristics and here we highlight important preclinical studies that have supported therapeutic development and continue to promote new ways to target AML cells. In addition, we describe clinical investigations that have led to FDA approval of new targeted AML therapies and ongoing clinical trials of novel therapies targeting AML survival pathways. We also describe the complexity of targeting leukemia stem cells (LSCs) as an approach to addressing relapse and remission in AML and targetable pathways that are unique to LSC survival. This comprehensive review details what we currently understand about the signaling pathways that support AML cell survival and the exceptional ways in which we disrupt them.","['Carter, Jenna L', 'Hege, Katie', 'Yang, Jay', 'Kalpage, Hasini A', 'Su, Yongwei', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Huttemann, Maik', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Carter JL', 'Hege K', 'Yang J', 'Kalpage HA', 'Su Y', 'Edwards H', 'Huttemann M', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5700-4884', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8748-716X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201218,England,Signal Transduct Target Ther,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,101676423,IM,,,2020/12/19 06:00,2021/10/14 06:00,['2020/12/18 05:42'],"['2020/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/18 05:42 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41392-020-00361-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41392-020-00361-x [pii]']",epublish,Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2020 Dec 18;5(1):288. doi: 10.1038/s41392-020-00361-x.,20211013,,"['Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'MD/PhD Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, The Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. jtaub@med.wayne.edu.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. jtaub@med.wayne.edu.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA. jtaub@med.wayne.edu."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. jtaub@med.wayne.edu.', 'Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. gey@karmanos.org.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. gey@karmanos.org.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA. gey@karmanos.org.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,['T32 CA009531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7746731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Akt is a serine/threonine kinase which was originally discovered as an oncogene. The prognostic value of Akt activation in some types of cancers and its effect on tumor suppressor genes remains to be fully elucidated. In the current research we have investigated the Akt-mediated downregulation of Btg2 that increased cells proliferation and cells survival. Human leukemia HL-60, THP-1 and colon cancer DLD-1 cells were used in this study. Inhibition of Akt with LY294002 significantly increased Btg2 mRNA expression while activation of Akt with insulin decreased Btg2 expression. Contrary to this, treatment of cells with U0126, a MAPK kinase inhibitor, significantly abrogated Btg2 expression. Moreover, LY294002 treatment increased Erk1/2 activation, decreased cells proliferation and cells viability while activation of Akt by insulin led to an increase in cells survival and cells division. Exogenous expression of Btg2 decreased cells proliferation both in the presence and absence of insulin and arrested cells at G1 phase. Akt negatively regulates Btg2 via Erk1/2 inhibition that lead to an increase in cells survival and cells proliferation. This elucidates a new mechanism for Btg2 regulation and Akt mediated tumorgenicity.","['Zubair, Hina', 'Lim, In Kyoung', 'Safi, Sher Zaman', 'Rehman, Fozia', 'Imran, Muhammad']","['Zubair H', 'Lim IK', 'Safi SZ', 'Rehman F', 'Imran M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'Btg2/TIS21/Pc3', 'Cancer Cells', 'Cells Proliferation', 'pErk1/2']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/12/18 05:40'],"['2020/12/18 05:40 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['50/6/711 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2020 Nov;50(6):711-716.,20210611,"['(c) 2020 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Biochemistry Section, Institute of Chemical Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Molecular Medicine, Ajou University School of Medicine and Graduate School, Suwon, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Research Center in Biomedical Materials (IRCBM), COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Interdisciplinary Research Center in Biomedical Materials (IRCBM), COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Biochemistry Section, Institute of Chemical Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan imrancl@uop.edu.pk.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Molecular Medicine, Ajou University School of Medicine and Graduate School, Suwon, Korea.']","['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']","['B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through increased understanding of the complex interactions between immunity and cancer, immunotherapy has emerged as a treatment modality for different types of cancer. Promising activity with immunotherapy has been reported in numerous malignancies, but challenges such as limited response rates and treatment resistance remain. Furthermore, outcomes with this therapeutic approach in hematologic malignancies are even more limited than in solid tumors. T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) has emerged as a potential immune checkpoint target in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. TIM-3 has been shown to promote immune tolerance, and overexpression of TIM-3 is associated with more aggressive or advanced disease and poor prognosis. AREAS COVERED: This review examines what is currently known regarding the biology of TIM-3 and clinical implications of targeting TIM-3 in cancer. Particular focus is given to myeloid malignancies. EXPERT OPINION: The targeting of TIM-3 is a promising therapeutic approach in cancers, including hematologic cancers such as myeloid malignancies which have not benefited much from current immunotherapeutic treatment approaches. We anticipate that with further clinical evaluation, TIM-3 blockade will emerge as an important treatment strategy in myeloid malignancies.","['Zeidan, Amer M', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Brunner, Andrew M']","['Zeidan AM', 'Komrokji RS', 'Brunner AM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210119,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'TIM-3', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'immunotherapy', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'myeloid malignancies']",2020/12/19 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2020/12/18 05:27'],"['2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/18 05:27 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2021.1865814 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2021 May;21(5):523-534. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2021.1865814.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center study of 125 children diagnosed with ALL between 2010 and 2016. Standard forms were used for data collection of variate clinical and paraclinical parameters. RESULTS: The children were predominantly male (64.8%) and their median age at diagnosis was 5 years. A total of 107 patients were diagnosed with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP)-ALL and 18 with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL. Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR assay for ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, KMT2A-AFF1, and STIL-TAL1 fusion genes was performed in 111 patients. ETV6-RUNX1 translocation was detected in 18.9% of patients, while BCR-ABL1 and E2A-PBX1 rearrangements were seen in 2.7% and 3.6%, respectively. Complete remission at the end of induction phase was obtained in 89.6% of patients. The overall relapse rate was 11.2%, with 11 early and 3 late relapses. The 5-year overall survival rate in BCP-ALL was 81.6% and in T-ALL 71.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year overall and event-free survival rates in our study were slightly lower than those reported in developed countries, so the patients' outcomes are encouraging.","['Alecsa, Mirabela-Smaranda', 'Moscalu, Mihaela', 'Trandafir, Laura-Mihaela', 'Ivanov, Anca-Viorica', 'Rusu, Cristina', 'Miron, Ingrith-Crenguta']","['Alecsa MS', 'Moscalu M', 'Trandafir LM', 'Ivanov AV', 'Rusu C', 'Miron IC']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8899-8594'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201215,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'childhood', 'molecular biology', 'outcomes']",2020/12/19 06:00,2020/12/19 06:01,['2020/12/18 01:02'],"['2020/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9124052 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9124052 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Dec 15;9(12). pii: jcm9124052. doi: 10.3390/jcm9124052.,,,"['Department Mother and Child Care, Division of Neonatology, Grigore T.

Here, we show that, despite continuous repression of HPV16 E6/E7 oncogenes, p53 did not instantly recover but instead showed a biphasic regulation marked by further depletion within 24 h followed by an increase at 72 h. Of note, during E6/E7 oncogene suppression, lysosomal degradation antagonizes p53 reconstitution. Consequently, the transcription of p53 responsive genes associated with senescence (e.g., PML and YPEL3) cannot be upregulated. In contrast, downstream genes involved in autophagy (e.g., DRAM1 and BNIP3) were activated, allowing the evasion of senescence under hypoxic conditions. Hence, dynamic regulation of p53 along with its downstream network of responsive genes favors cellular adaptation and enhances cell survival, although the expression of the viral E6/E7-oncogenes as drivers for proliferation remained inhibited under hypoxia.","['Zhuang, Linhan', 'Ly, Regina', 'Rosl, Frank', 'Niebler, Martina']","['Zhuang L', 'Ly R', 'Rosl F', 'Niebler M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1006-5911'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201215,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['autophagy', 'cervical cancer', 'human papillomavirus', 'hypoxia', 'p53', 'senescence']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/12/18 01:01'],"['2020/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249533 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249533 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 15;21(24). pii: ijms21249533. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249533.,20210319,,"['Division of Viral Transformation Mechanisms, Research Program Infection, Inflammation & Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Viral Transformation Mechanisms, Research Program Infection, Inflammation & Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Viral Transformation Mechanisms, Research Program Infection, Inflammation & Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Viral Transformation Mechanisms, Research Program Infection, Inflammation & Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']","['0 (BNIP3 protein, human)', '0 (DRAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (YPEL3 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']","['Autophagy/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Hypoxia/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Human papillomavirus 16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Papillomavirus Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/virology']",,,['not applicable/China Scholarship Council Graduate Student Fellowship'],PMC7765197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an attractive molecular target exploited in the immunotherapy of B cell-derived lymphomas and leukemia. Currently, several monoclonal antibodies targeting CD37 as well as chimeric antigen receptor-based immunotherapies are being developed and investigated in clinical trials. Given the unique role of CD37 in the biology of B cells, it seems that CD37 constitutes more than a docking point for monoclonal antibodies, and targeting this molecule may provide additional benefit to relapsed or refractory patients. In this review, we aimed to provide an extensive overview of the function of CD37 in B cell malignancies, providing a comprehensive view of recent therapeutic advances targeting CD37 and delineating future perspectives.","['Bobrowicz, Malgorzata', 'Kubacz, Matylda', 'Slusarczyk, Aleksander', 'Winiarska, Magdalena']","['Bobrowicz M', 'Kubacz M', 'Slusarczyk A', 'Winiarska M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9078-5168'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201215,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CD20', 'CD37', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'monoclonal antibodies', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'tetraspanin']",2020/12/19 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/12/18 01:01'],"['2020/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249531 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249531 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 15;21(24). pii: ijms21249531. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249531.,20210319,,"['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Tetraspanins)']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Tetraspanins/*immunology/*metabolism']",,,"['2015/18/E/NZ6/00702, 2019/35/D/NZ5/01191/Narodowe Centrum Nauki']",PMC7765243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Patients who were admitted to the Department of Hematology in a tertiary-care general hospital from March 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 and underwent chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy comprised the intervention group. They were screened for intestinal CRE at least thrice. From December 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017, patients who underwent chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy without active intestinal CRE screening in the Department of Hematology formed the control group. Both the patient groups were monitored for CRE infection in real time. The chi(2) test was used to compare the changes in the CRE infection rate and mortality in high-risk patients before and after the active screening. Results: During the intervention period, the CRE colonization rate of patients was 16.46% (66/401) ; in terms of disease distribution, the colonization rate of acute leukemia was the highest 23.03% (26/113) . Of the 66 colonized patients, 27 (40.9%) patients were identified as positive for CRE at the first screening, 15 (22.7%) were identified at the time of the second screening, and the remaining 24 (36.4%) were identified at the third or subsequent screening; Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRPK) strains were dominant among the pathogens, accounting for 54.55% (36/66) . During the active screening period, the CRE infection rate (2.49%) and mortality rate (50.00%) of high-risk patients were significantly lower than those of the controls (11.30% and 69.23%, respectively) . The pathogens of 10 CRE infection patients during the intervention period were exactly the same as the previous active screening pathogens, and the coincidence rate was 100%. Conclusion: The CRE colonization rate was the highest in patients with acute leukemia who were admitted in the hematology wards. CRPK is the main pathogen of CRE colonization, infection, and death. Increasing the frequency of screening can significantly raise the positive rate of screening, Active screening can effectively reduce the incidence and subsequent mortality of CRE in high-risk patients admitted in the hematological wards. High coincidence rate between CRE screening positive pathogens and subsequent CRE infection pathogens. Intestinal CRE screening can serve as an indicator of CRE bloodstream infection in patients with hematological diseases as well as provide information for antibiotics therapy.","['Huang, X L', 'Wu, S H', 'Shi, P F', 'Xu, L H', 'Chen, C', 'Xie, Y P', 'Gao, D Q', 'Chen, K', 'Tan, J F', 'Liu, L R', 'Xu, Y', 'Yang, F', 'Yu, M X', 'Wang, S Y', 'Qian, S X']","['Huang XL', 'Wu SH', 'Shi PF', 'Xu LH', 'Chen C', 'Xie YP', 'Gao DQ', 'Chen K', 'Tan JF', 'Liu LR', 'Xu Y', 'Yang F', 'Yu MX', 'Wang SY', 'Qian SX']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Active screening', 'Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'Evaluation of effect']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/12/17 22:10'],"['2020/12/17 22:10 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.11.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Nov 14;41(11):932-936. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.11.009.,20210204,,"[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Microbiology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Microbiology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hospital Infection Prevention and Control, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, China.""]",['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology', '*Enterobacteriaceae Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology', '*Hematology', 'Humans']",,,"['LGF18H260009/Zhejiang Basic Public Welfare Research Project', '2018A05/Hangzhou Medical and Health Plan', '20142013A61/Hangzhou Science and Technology Development Plan']",PMC7767815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: One hundred and seventy-eight patients newly diagnosed with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia with ETV6-RUNX1 rearrangement from April 2008 to April 2015 were enrolled in CCLG-ALL-2008. The follow up period ended in July 2018; we performed retrospective analyses of their data to determine the efficacy of the regimen and the prognostic factors. Results: The median age of the study population (178 pediatric patients) , including 100 boys and 78 girls was 4 (1-13) y, and the median white blood cell count at diagnosis was 9.46 (1.25-239.83) x10(9)/L. Three patients died, and 1 was lost to follow up by the end of the first induction chemotherapy, resulting in an induced remission rate of 97.8% (174/178) . The cumulative incidence of relapse was 15.9% with a median follow up of 73.5 mon. Total 83.3% of the relapse cases were those of isolated bone marrow relapse, while 79.2% of the cases were those of late relapse. The median interval time between relapse and first complete remission was 35.5 mon (range, 1-62 months) . One of the 5 patients with early recurrence and 7 of the 19 with late recurrence cases survived. The 5-year-OS and 5-year-EFS of ETV6-RUNX1 positive children was (89.4+/-2.4) % and (82.1+/-6.9) %, respectively. The estimated 10-year-OS and 10-year-EFS of ETV6-RUNX1 positive children was (88.6+/-2.5) % and (77.3+/-4.0) %, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test were used to estimate and compare the survival. Univariate statistical analysis showed that poor prognostic factors that influenced survival included central nervous system state 2 at diagnosis, poor prednisone response, high risk, gene positivity after induction chemotherapy, as well as MRD positivity and gene positivity at the 12(th) week. In the multivariate analysis, only the central nervous system state 2 at diagnosis and MRD positivity at the 12(th) week were associated with the outcome. Conclusion: ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL is a subgroup with a favorable prognosis as per the CCLG-ALL-2008 protocol. Patients with ETV6-RUNX1 should be given more intensive therapy, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation when they are CNS2 at diagnosis or have high level of MRD at the 12(th) week after treatment.","['Liu, F', 'Chen, X J', 'Guo, Y', 'Yang, W Y', 'Chen, X', 'Zhang, X Y', 'Zhang, R R', 'Ren, Y Y', 'Zhu, X F']","['Liu F', 'Chen XJ', 'Guo Y', 'Yang WY', 'Chen X', 'Zhang XY', 'Zhang RR', 'Ren YY', 'Zhu XF']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CCLG-ALL-2008 protocol', 'ETV6-RUNX1 rearrangement', 'Leukemia, lymphoblastic, acute', 'Pediatric', 'Prognosis']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/12/17 22:10'],"['2020/12/17 22:10 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.11.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Nov 14;41(11):896-902. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.11.003.,20210204,,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology; National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases; Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']","['Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,['81421002/National Natural Science Fund of China'],PMC7767800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To detect histamine directly, we immobilized oxygen-independent histamine dehydrogenase (HmDH) onto the surface of cup-stacked carbon nanofibers (CSCNFs), which work both as an electrical nanowire and an enzyme support, and investigated the direct electron transfer reaction from HmDH reduced by histamine to CSCNF. Current responses of histamine oxidation at the HmDH-modified CSCNF electrode showed a linear relationship between 0.3 microM and 300 microM with detection limit of 0.1 microM in a Briton Robinson buffer (pH 9.4) and was about 25 times larger than those at a flat glassy carbon electrode modified with HmDH because of its three-dimensional network. Using the HmDH-modified CSCNF electrode, we successfully observed histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 after stimulation with degranulation agents, such as antigen 2,4-dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin and calcium ionophore A23187.

Mcl-1 expression plays a key role in survival of cancer cells and therefore serves as a promising target in cancer therapy. Besides, its importance as a cancer target, various peptides and small-molecule inhibitors have been successfully designed and synthesized, yet no Mcl-1 inhibitor is approved for clinical use. However, recent development on the understanding of Mcl-1's role in key cellular processes in cancer and an upsurge of reports highlighting its association in various anticancer drug resistance supports the view that Mcl-1 is a key target in various cancers, especially hematological cancers. This review compiles structures of a variety of inhibitors of Mcl-1 reported to date. These include inhibitors based on a diverse range of heterocycles (e.g. indole, imidazole, thiophene, nicotinic acid, piperazine, triazine, thiazole, isoindoline), oligomers (terphenyl, quaterpyridine), polyphenol, phenalene, anthranilic acid, anthraquinone, macrocycles, natural products, and metal-based complexes. In addition, an effort has been made to summarize the structure activity relationships, based on a variety of assays, of some important classes of Mcl-1 inhibitors, giving affinities and selectivities for Mcl-1 compared to other Bcl-2 family members. A focus has been placed on categorizing the inhibitors based on their core frameworks (scaffolds) to appeal to the chemical biologist or medicinal chemist.","['Negi, Arvind', 'Murphy, Paul V']","['Negi A', 'Murphy PV']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201124,France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/04/23 06:00,['2020/12/17 20:13'],"['2020/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/17 20:13 [entrez]']","['S0223-5234(20)31010-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.113038 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2021 Jan 15;210:113038. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.113038.

One hundred and thirteen newly diagnosed Chinese adults with AML, divided into groups of younger and older patients, were enrolled in this study. Bone marrow samples from the patients were analyzed using targeted next-generation sequencing with a panel of 141 genes. Ninety-eight mutated genes were detected and the top 10 mutated genes were KMT2D, FLT3, FAT1, ASXL1, NRAS, DNMT3A, RELN, TET2, JAK2, and KRAS. The top five functional groups were the tyrosine kinase pathway, transcription factors, DNA methylation, chromatin modifiers, and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Younger patients exhibited higher incidences of KMT2D (33.8% vs 10.4%, P = 0.004) and KRAS (15.4% vs 2.1%, P = 0.042) mutations than older patients; whereas, older patients harbored more SRSF2 (20.8% vs 0%, P = 0.002), transcription factor (85.4% vs 67.7%, P = 0.031), DNA methylation (58.3% vs 36.9%, P = 0.024), and RNA splicing (31.3% vs 12.3%, P = 0.013) mutations than younger patients. Moreover, patients with SRSF2 mutations exhibited a lower rate of overall survival (P < 0.001) and relapse-free survival (P < 0.001) than patients carrying wild-type SRSF2. In conclusion, rarely reported KMT2D, FAT1, and RELN mutations were detected at high frequencies in our cohort. The gene mutation spectrum of older patients was different to that of younger patients. Moreover, older patients harbored more SRSF2 mutations, which predicted lower rates of overall and relapse-free survival.","['Zhong, Wei-Jie', 'Liu, Xiu-Dan', 'Zhong, Li-Ye', 'Li, Kang-Bao', 'Sun, Qi-Xin', 'Xu, Xin', 'Wei, Ting', 'Li, Qing-Shan', 'Zhu, Zhi-Gang']","['Zhong WJ', 'Liu XD', 'Zhong LY', 'Li KB', 'Sun QX', 'Xu X', 'Wei T', 'Li QS', 'Zhu ZG']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20201214,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Gene mutation', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'Older patients', 'SRSF2']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/12/17 20:11'],"['2020/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/17 20:11 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(20)31013-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2020.145344 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2021 Feb 20;770:145344. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2020.145344.

However, even after an initial favorable response, almost all patients relapse, with the exact mechanisms underlying primary or secondary 5-AZA resistance remaining largely unknown. Several reports have previously demonstrated the significance of hypoxia in the regulation of both physiological and malignant hematopoiesis. In MDS, high hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (Hif-1alpha) expression has been correlated with poor overall survival and disease progression, while its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis was recently reported. We herein investigated the possible association of the Hif-1alpha signaling pathway with response to 5-AZA therapy in MDS/AML patients. Our data demonstrated that 5-AZA-responders present with higher Hif-1alpha mRNA and protein expression compared to 5-AZA-non-responders/stable disease patients, before the initiation of therapy, while, interestingly, no significant differences in Hif-1alpha mRNA expression at the 6-month follow-up were observed. Moreover, we found that 5-AZA-responders exhibited elevated mRNA levels of the Hif-1alpha downstream targets lactate dehydrogenase a (LDHa) and BCL2 interacting protein 3 like (BNIP3L), a further indication of an overactivated Hif-1a signaling pathway in these patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant correlation between high Hif-1alpha mRNA expression and better survival rates, while logistic regression analysis showed that Hif-1alpha mRNA expression is an independent predictor of response to 5-AZA therapy. From the clinical point of view, apart from proposing Hif-1alpha mRNA expression as a significant predictive factor for response to 5-AZA, our data offer new perspectives on MDS combinational therapies, suggesting a potential synergistic activity of 5-AZA and Hif-1alpha inducers, such as propyl hydroxylases inhibitors (PHDi).","['Mpakou, Vassiliki', 'Spathis, Aris', 'Bouchla, Anthi', 'Tsakiraki, Zoi', 'Kontsioti, Frieda', 'Papageorgiou, Sotirios', 'Bazani, Efthymia', 'Gkontopoulos, Konstantinos', 'Thomopoulos, Thomas', 'Glezou, Irene', 'Galanopoulos, Athanasios', 'Symeonidis, Argiris', 'Diamantopoulos, Panagiotis T', 'Viniou, Nora-Athina', 'Kontandreopoulou, Christina-Nefeli', 'Zafeiropoulou, Kalliopi', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Lamprianidou, Eleftheria', 'Foukas, Periklis', 'Mpamias, Aristoteles', 'Pappa, Vasiliki']","['Mpakou V', 'Spathis A', 'Bouchla A', 'Tsakiraki Z', 'Kontsioti F', 'Papageorgiou S', 'Bazani E', 'Gkontopoulos K', 'Thomopoulos T', 'Glezou I', 'Galanopoulos A', 'Symeonidis A', 'Diamantopoulos PT', 'Viniou NA', 'Kontandreopoulou CN', 'Zafeiropoulou K', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Lamprianidou E', 'Foukas P', 'Mpamias A', 'Pappa V']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3376-837X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2692-5944', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0421-9424']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210101,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine (5-AlphaZetaAlpha)', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif-1alpha) signaling pathway', 'immunohistochemistry (IHC)', 'myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)', 'quantitative real-time PCR', 'treatment response']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/12/17 17:20'],"['2020/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/17 17:20 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2834 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr;39(2):231-242. doi: 10.1002/hon.2834.

A 6-month-old girl was evaluated with recurrent fever, failure to thrive, skin lesions and anaemia. She received blood transfusions and empirical antibiotics. Skin lesions, previously interpreted as insect bites, consisted of numerous firm asymptomatic erythematous papules and nodules, distributed over trunk and limbs. Skin histopathology revealed an intense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate extending to the subcutaneous, with numerous atypical myeloid cells, requiring the diagnosis of leukaemia cutis, to be ruled out. Over the follow-up, she developed herpetic stomatitis, tonsillitis, lobar pneumonia and Metapneumovirus tracheitis, and also deeper skin lesions, resembling panniculitis. Hypogammaglobulinaemia was diagnosed. An autoinflammatory disease was confirmed by whole exome sequencing: heterozygous mutations for TRNT1 NM_182916 c.495_498del, p.F167Tfs * 9 and TRNT1 NM_182916 c.1246A>G, p.K416E. The patient has been treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin and etanercept. She presented with developmental delay and short stature for age. The fever, anaemia, skin neutrophilic infiltration and the inflammatory parameters improved. We describe a novel mutation in SIFD and the first to present skin manifestations, namely neutrophilic dermal and hypodermal infiltration.","['Bardou, Maine Luellah Demaret', 'Rivitti-Machado, Maria Cecilia', 'Michalany, Nilceo Schwery', 'de Jesus, Adriana Almeida', 'Goldbach-Mansky, Raphaela', 'Barros, Joao Coriolano Rego', 'Terreri, Maria Teresa de Sande E Lemos Ramos Ascensao', 'Grumach, Anete Sevciovic']","['Bardou MLD', 'Rivitti-Machado MC', 'Michalany NS', 'de Jesus AA', 'Goldbach-Mansky R', 'Barros JCR', 'Terreri MTSELRA', 'Grumach AS']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9831-4080', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2910-7330', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9300-163X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2352-909X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7865-5769', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5803-6274', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2496-4296', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9803-0309']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20201217,Australia,Australas J Dermatol,The Australasian journal of dermatology,0135232,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['TRNT1', 'autoinflammatory disease', 'leukaemia cutis', 'neutrophilic dermatosis', 'periodic fever']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/17 17:19'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/17 17:19 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajd.13527 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas J Dermatol. 2021 May;62(2):e276-e279. doi: 10.1111/ajd.13527.

We investigated whether preparative combination chemotherapy could replace TBI in such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: FORUM is a randomized, controlled, open-label, international, multicenter, phase III, noninferiority study. Patients </= 18 years at diagnosis, 4-21 years at HSCT, in complete remission pre-HSCT, and with an HLA-compatible related or unrelated donor were randomly assigned to myeloablative conditioning with fractionated 12 Gy TBI and etoposide versus fludarabine, thiotepa, and either busulfan or treosulfan. The noninferiority margin was 8%. With 1,000 patients randomly assigned in 5 years, 2-year minimum follow-up, and one-sided alpha of 5%, 80% power was calculated. A futility stopping rule would halt random assignment if chemoconditioning was significantly inferior to TBI (EudraCT: 2012-003032-22; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01949129). RESULTS: Between April 2013 and December 2018, 543 patients were screened, 417 were randomly assigned, 212 received TBI, and 201 received chemoconditioning. The stopping rule was applied on March 31, 2019. The median follow-up was 2.1 years. In the intention-to-treat population, 2-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher following TBI (0.91; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.95; P < .0001) versus chemoconditioning (0.75; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81). Two-year cumulative incidence of relapse and treatment-related mortality were 0.12 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.17; P < .0001) and 0.02 (95% CI, < 0.01 to 0.05; P = .0269) following TBI and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.40) and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.14) following chemoconditioning, respectively. CONCLUSION: Improved OS and lower relapse risk were observed following TBI plus etoposide compared with chemoconditioning. We therefore recommend TBI plus etoposide for patients > 4 years old with high-risk ALL undergoing allogeneic HSCT.","['Peters, Christina', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Poetschger, Ulrike', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Buechner, Jochen', 'Shaw, Peter J', 'Staciuk, Raquel', 'Ifversen, Marianne', 'Pichler, Herbert', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Svec, Peter', 'Aleinikova, Olga', 'Stein, Jerry', 'Gungor, Tayfun', 'Toporski, Jacek', 'Truong, Tony H', 'Diaz-de-Heredia, Cristina', 'Bierings, Marc', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Essa, Mohammed', 'Burkhardt, Birgit', 'Schultz, Kirk', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Lankester, Arjan', 'Ansari, Marc', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Corbacioglu, Selim', 'Bader, Peter']","['Peters C', 'Dalle JH', 'Locatelli F', 'Poetschger U', 'Sedlacek P', 'Buechner J', 'Shaw PJ', 'Staciuk R', 'Ifversen M', 'Pichler H', 'Vettenranta K', 'Svec P', 'Aleinikova O', 'Stein J', 'Gungor T', 'Toporski J', 'Truong TH', 'Diaz-de-Heredia C', 'Bierings M', 'Ariffin H', 'Essa M', 'Burkhardt B', 'Schultz K', 'Meisel R', 'Lankester A', 'Ansari M', 'Schrappe M', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Balduzzi A', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Bader P']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201217,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/12/17 17:15'],"['2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/17 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.02529 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Feb 1;39(4):295-307. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.02529.

33332067,,Publisher,,,,,2020 Aug 5,,,,"Myeloproliferative disorders, also known as myeloproliferative neoplasms, are stem cell disorders, which encompass a heterogenous group of blood cancers such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), essential thrombocythemia (ET), myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia.(1)(,)(2) Myeloproliferative disorders are chronic conditions characterized by an abnormal overproduction of white cells, red cells, or platelets in the bone marrow.(2) Patients living with myeloproliferative disorders may experience stable or slowly progressing disease, and clinical manifestations may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, splenomegaly, bone pain, bleeding disorders, and stroke.(2) In 2016, the prevalence of Canadians living with or who were in remission from leukemia (all types), PV, ET, and MF was estimated to be 22,510, 14,300, 8,700, and 1,800, respectively.(3) With various treatment options for CML depending on factors such as patient age, phase of disease, blood cell counts, and availability of stem cell donors, targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., imatinib) may be used for most patients with CML as first-line therapy.(4) For patients with resistant CML or who are intolerant to targeted therapy, biological therapy with interferon alfa may be considered.(4) Treatment options for PV, ET, and MF may include chemotherapy (e.g., hydroxyurea [HU]), targeted therapy (e.g., ruxolitinib), or biological therapy (e.g., interferon alfa).(5) Currently, various pegylated interferons are approved in Canada for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C and for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. None has received a Health Canada Notice of Compliance for an oncology indication. In spite of this, pegylated interferon has been used off-label in Canadian jurisdictions for the treatment of some cancers and some hospitals may choose to provide funding for this treatment. The aim of this report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pegylated interferon alfa 2a (Peg-IFNalpha-2a) therapy in patients with myeloproliferative disorders.","['Li, Yan', 'Ford, Caitlyn']","['Li Y', 'Ford C']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book']",,Ottawa (ON),,,,,,,2020/12/18 06:01,2020/12/18 06:01,,,['NBK565476 [bookaccession]'],,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20201218,['Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health'],['CADTH Rapid Response Reports'],"['Pegylated Interferon Alfa 2a Therapy in Patients with Myeloproliferative', 'Disorders: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness']",['2020/12/18 06:01'],,

However, the role of specialty palliative care for improving the QOL and care for this population is currently unknown. Objective: To assess the effect of integrated palliative and oncology care (IPC) on patient-reported and EOL outcomes in patients with AML. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a multisite randomized clinical trial of IPC (n = 86) vs usual care (UC) (n = 74) for patients with AML undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Data were collected from January 2017 through July 2019 at 4 tertiary care academic hospitals in the United States. Interventions: Patients assigned to IPC were seen by palliative care clinicians at least twice per week during their initial and subsequent hospitalizations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients completed the 44-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia scale (score range, 0-176) to assess QOL; the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), with subscales assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression (score range, 0-21); and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version to assess posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (score range, 17-85) at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24. The primary end point was QOL at week 2. We used analysis of covariance adjusting and mixed linear effect models to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. We used Fisher exact test to compare patient-reported discussion of EOL care preferences and receipt of chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life. Results: Of 235 eligible patients, 160 (68.1%) were enrolled; of the 160 participants, the median (range) age was 64.4 (19.7-80.1) years, and 64 (40.0%) were women. Compared with those receiving UC, IPC participants reported better QOL (adjusted mean score, 107.59 vs 116.45; P = .04), and lower depression (adjusted mean score, 7.20 vs 5.68; P = .02), anxiety (adjusted mean score, 5.94 vs 4.53; P = .02), and PTSD symptoms (adjusted mean score, 31.69 vs 27.79; P = .01) at week 2. Intervention effects were sustained to week 24 for QOL (beta, 2.35; 95% CI, 0.02-4.68; P = .048), depression (beta, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.82 to -0.02; P = .04), anxiety (beta, -0.38; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.01; P = .04), and PTSD symptoms (beta, -1.43; 95% CI, -2.34 to -0.54; P = .002). Among patients who died, those receiving IPC were more likely than those receiving UC to report discussing EOL care preferences (21 of 28 [75.0%] vs 12 of 30 [40.0%]; P = .01) and less likely to receive chemotherapy near EOL (15 of 43 [34.9%] vs 27 of 41 [65.9%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of patients with AML, IPC led to substantial improvements in QOL, psychological distress, and EOL care. Palliative care should be considered a new standard of care for patients with AML.

Surprisingly, clonal hematopoiesis is also recognized as a new cardiovascular risk factor. Specific patient categories may be at higher risk for the consequences of clonal hematopoiesis. For future risk stratification, there is a need to distinguish high-risk clonal hematopoiesis from 'physiological' ageing processes.

In the present study, Trdmt1 was up-regulated and miR-181a was down-regulated significantly during human leukemia HL-60 cell differentiation after TAT-CT3 fusion protein treatment. Accordingly, miR-181a overexpression in HL-60 cells inhibited granulocytic maturation. In addition, our ""rescue"" assay demonstrated that Trdmt1 3'-untranslated region promoted myeloid differentiation of HL-60 cells by sequestering miR-181a and up-regulating C/EBPalpha (a critical factor for normal myelopoiesis) via its competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity on miR-181a. These findings revealed an unrecognized role of Trdmt1 as a potential ceRNA for therapeutic targets in AML.","['Xu, Sha', 'Xiong, Jun', 'Wu, Minjuan', 'Yang, Yu', 'Jiang, Junfeng', 'Ni, Haitao', 'Zhao, Yunpeng', 'Wang, Yue']","['Xu S', 'Xiong J', 'Wu M', 'Yang Y', 'Jiang J', 'Ni H', 'Zhao Y', 'Wang Y']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4155-9284', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9856-6130', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6734-5618', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7234-7113', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2696-2032', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8899-4246', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3339-5139', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0564-3019']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/12/17 08:42'],"['2020/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 08:42 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2021000200608 [pii]', '10.1590/1414-431X20209869 [doi]']",epublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2020 Dec 9;54(2):e9869. doi: 10.1590/1414-431X20209869. eCollection 2020.,20210202,,"['Institute of Translational Medicine, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Embryology and Histology, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Embryology and Histology, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Embryology and Histology, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Embryology and Histology, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Embryology and Histology, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Embryology and Histology, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Embryology and Histology, Navy Medical University, Shanghai, China.']","[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (TRDMT1 protein, human)']","[""*3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*MicroRNAs/genetics']",,,,PMC7727116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow samples were collected from 176 AML patients and 40 healthy donors, and KIF2A expression was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Treatment response, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed in AML patients. In vitro, KIF2A expression in AML cell lines and CD34+ cells (from healthy donors) was measured, and the effect of KIF2A knockdown on AML cell proliferation and apoptosis in HL-60 and KG-1 cells was detected. KIF2A expression was greater in AML patients compared to healthy donors, and receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that KIF2A expression predicted increased AML risk (area under curve: 0.793 (95%CI: 0.724-0.826)). In AML patients, KIF2A expression positively correlated with white blood cells, monosomal karyotype, and high risk stratification. Furthermore, no correlation of KIF2A expression with complete remission or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was found. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that KIF2A expression was negatively correlated with EFS and OS. In vitro experiments showed that KIF2A was overexpressed in AML cell lines (KG-1, HL-60, ME-1, and HT-93) compared to CD34+ cells, moreover, cell proliferation was reduced but apoptosis was increased by KIF2A knockdown in HL-60 and KG-1 cells.

No validated pediatric CIPN patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures exist. Purpose: To test sensitivity, internal consistency reliability, content and convergent validity, and feasibility of the Pediatric Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy (P-CIN), an electronic PRO measure for assessing CIPN in children who received neurotoxic chemotherapy. Method: Five experts evaluated content validity of the 14-item P-CIN. Children 5 to 17 years old with CIPN (N = 79) completed the P-CIN via tablet computer; a subset (n = 26) also underwent neurological examinations using the Pediatric-Modified Total Neuropathy Score. Following preliminary analyses, one item was deleted and three others modified. The revised P-CIN was retested with patients (n = 6) who also completed the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency motor function assessment. Means, item response ranges, standard deviations, content validity indexes, Cronbach's alphas, and correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Mean participant age was 11.25 (SD = 4.0) years. Most had acute leukemia (62.5%) and received vincristine (98.7%). Content validity index coefficients ranged from .80 to 1.0 (p = .05). For 9 of 14 items, responses ranged from 0 to 4 or 5; response ranges for toe numbness, pick up a coin, and three of four pain items were 0 to 3. After deleting one item, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .83. P-CIN scores were strongly associated with Pediatric-Modified Total Neuropathy Score (r = .52, p < .01) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (r = -.83, p = .04) scores. Sixty-eight percent of children 6 to 17 years old completed P-CIN independently. Discussion: Preliminary evidence suggests that the 13-item P-CIN is internally consistent, is valid, and can be completed independently by children >/= 6 years. However, we recommend additional testing.","['Smith, Ellen M Lavoie', 'Kuisell, Clare', 'Kanzawa-Lee, Grace', 'Bridges, Celia M', 'Cho, Youmin', 'Swets, Jenna', 'Renbarger, Jamie L', 'Gilchrist, Laura S']","['Smith EML', 'Kuisell C', 'Kanzawa-Lee G', 'Bridges CM', 'Cho Y', 'Swets J', 'Renbarger JL', 'Gilchrist LS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201217,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'pediatric', 'psychometrics', 'side effects of treatment']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2020/12/17 08:40'],"['2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/17 08:40 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1043454220980253 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2021 Mar-Apr;38(2):131-141. doi: 10.1177/1043454220980253.

Thus, to reach a similar maternal tolerance as in conventional breeding by artificial insemination (AI) would be the key to ET-success. For this reason, we studied the expression of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine and its receptor in the pig endometrium during the implantation period (days 18 and 24) in sows subjected to ET (AL group) vs. post-cervical-AI controls (Hemi-AL group). Quantification of expression was performed at both mRNA (rt-qPCR) and protein (WB) levels. The expression of endometrial LIF on day 24 was considerably lower in ET than in AI pregnancies. Correlations between endometrial mRNA levels of LIF and LIF-R showed that, contrary to early AI-pregnancies, ET-pregnancies lack an inverse relation between cytokine and receptor levels. In conclusion, ET-pregnancies lack sufficient endometrial levels of LIF to develop adequate immunotolerance mechanisms to prevent the rejection of allogeneic ET-embryos.","['Cambra, Josep M', 'Jauregi-Miguel, Amaia', 'Alvarez-Rodriguez, Manuel', 'Parrilla, Inmaculada', 'Gil, Maria A', 'Martinez, Emilio A', 'Cuello, Cristina', 'Rodriguez-Martinez, Heriberto', 'Martinez, Cristina A']","['Cambra JM', 'Jauregi-Miguel A', 'Alvarez-Rodriguez M', 'Parrilla I', 'Gil MA', 'Martinez EA', 'Cuello C', 'Rodriguez-Martinez H', 'Martinez CA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201124,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,,['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'LIF receptor', 'allogeneic pregnancy', 'embryo transfer', 'endometrium', 'immunotolerance', 'pig']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 05:54'],"['2020/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:54 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fvets.2020.611598 [doi]'],epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2020 Nov 24;7:611598. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2020.611598. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Cambra, Jauregi-Miguel, Alvarez-Rodriguez, Parrilla, Gil,', 'Martinez, Cuello, Rodriguez-Martinez and Martinez.']","['Department of Medicine and Animal Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, International Excellence Campus for Higher Education and Research ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research of Murcia (IMIB-Arrixaca), Campus de Ciencias de la Salud, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedical & Clinical Sciences (BKV), BKH/Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical & Clinical Sciences (BKV), BKH/Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Wallenberg Centre for Molecular Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical & Clinical Sciences (BKV), BKH/Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine and Animal Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, International Excellence Campus for Higher Education and Research ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research of Murcia (IMIB-Arrixaca), Campus de Ciencias de la Salud, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and Animal Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, International Excellence Campus for Higher Education and Research ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research of Murcia (IMIB-Arrixaca), Campus de Ciencias de la Salud, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and Animal Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, International Excellence Campus for Higher Education and Research ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research of Murcia (IMIB-Arrixaca), Campus de Ciencias de la Salud, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and Animal Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, International Excellence Campus for Higher Education and Research ""Campus Mare Nostrum"", University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research of Murcia (IMIB-Arrixaca), Campus de Ciencias de la Salud, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedical & Clinical Sciences (BKV), BKH/Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical & Clinical Sciences (BKV), BKH/Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",,,,,,PMC7732548,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to describe erythropoietic reconstitution as an indicator of long-term graft function by modeling hemoglobin levels during the first 3 years post HSCT in pediatric patients. We retrospectively included 414 patients and 11,957 measurements. The largest hemoglobin increase was at day 45 and levels reached a steady state at day 648 with a level of 7.48 mmol/L. In patients transplanted for hematological malignancies hemoglobin levels normalized faster (p < 0.0001). Increasing patient age correlated with faster recovery (p < 0.0001), while donor age had no influence. Conditioning, donor type and graft source did not influence recovery significantly. In the ABO mismatched group there was a transient negative effect on hemoglobin levels, and a delay in reticulocyte recovery (21 vs. 19 days; p = 0.012). In contrast, hemoglobin levels reached a higher plateau beyond 9 months in these patients (p < 0.0001). After alloHSCT, experiencing a CMV reactivation negatively affected reconstitution (p = 0.034), while EBV reactivations and acute graft vs. host disease did not. In summary, erythropoietic recovery was mainly influenced by patient factors and primary disease, and less influenced by donor factors.","['von Asmuth, Erik G J', 'Mohseny, Alexander B', 'Putter, Hein', 'Schilham, Marco W', 'Lankester, Arjan C']","['von Asmuth EGJ', 'Mohseny AB', 'Putter H', 'Schilham MW', 'Lankester AC']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201130,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['blood group (AB0)', 'erythropoiesis', 'leukemia', 'pediatric stem cell transplantation', 'retrospective']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 05:53'],"['2020/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2020.584156 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2020 Nov 30;8:584156. doi: 10.3389/fped.2020.584156. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 von Asmuth, Mohseny, Putter, Schilham and Lankester.']","[""Willem Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."", ""Willem Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."", 'Department of Medical Statistics, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands.', ""Willem Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands."", ""Willem Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.""]",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

To date, there is no literature reporting the identification of the t(14;19) in Chinese CLL patients and the reviewing the characteristic of all patients with this abnormality reported previously in the literature. Patients and Methods: We first demonstrate three cases of t(14;19) translocation among the 200 CLL patients from 2017 to 2019 in our hospital. We investigated several aspects such as clinicopathologic features, cytogenetic analysis, IGHV mutations, next-generation sequencing technology (NGS), and histopathological characteristics in order to clearly define the features of this entity in Chinese patients and compare them with patients reported previously in western countries. Results: The clinical and pathological features of our three cases resemble those of earlier reports. All patients had atypical morphologic features and atypical immunophenotypes with low CLL scores detected by flow cytometry. All cases were unmutated in the IGHV mutations. Two cases showed complex karyotype and one case demonstrate missense mutations of TP53 and FBXW7. Conclusion: In conclusion, this is the first report on IGH/BCL3-positive B-CLLs in Chinese people, which provided a comprehensive analysis of clinical and pathological characteristics. In addition to some similar clinical and laboratory features reported in the previous literature, we first found that CLL with t(14;19) has a higher possibility of being accompanied with high complex karyotype (high-CK), which is now regarded as a novel negative prognostic marker. Early identification of this abnormality in CLL patients is so important that patients can benefit from the more aggressive treatments at the onset of the disease.","['Li, Qinlu', 'Xing, Shugang', 'Zhang, Heng', 'Mao, Xia', 'Xiao, Min', 'Wei, Jia', 'Wang, Ying']","['Li Q', 'Xing S', 'Zhang H', 'Mao X', 'Xiao M', 'Wei J', 'Wang Y']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201119,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL3 rearrangement', 'chromosome banding analysis', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'complex karyotype', 'fluorescence in situ hybridization']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 05:52'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:52 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.594732 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 19;10:594732. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.594732. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Li, Xing, Zhang, Mao, Xiao, Wei and Wang.']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",,,,,,PMC7711105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune disorders in AML and impaired immune cell function have been found to be associated with abnormal karyotypes in AML patients. Immunotherapy has become an alternative therapeutic method that can improve the outcomes of AML patients. For solid tumors, the expression patterns of genes associated with the immune microenvironment provide valuable prognostic information. However, the prognostic roles of immune genes in AML have not been studied as yet. In this study, we identified 136 immune-related genes associated with overall survival in AML patients through a univariate Cox regression analysis using data from TCGA-AML and GTEx datasets. Next, we selected 24 hub genes from among the 136 genes based on the PPI network analysis. The 24 immune-related hub genes further underwent multivariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis. Finally, a 6 immune-related gene signature was constructed to predict the prognosis of AML patients. The function of the hub IRGs and the relationships between hub IRGs and transcriptional factors were investigated. We found that higher levels of expression of CSK, MMP7, PSMA7, PDCD1, IKBKG, and ISG15 were associated with an unfavorable prognosis of AML patients. Meanwhile, patients in the TCGA-AML datasets were divided into a high risk score group and a low risk score group, based on the median risk score value. Patients in the high risk group tended to show poorer prognosis [P = 0.00019, HR = 1.89 (1.26-2.83)]. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.6643. Multivariate Cox Regression assay confirmed that the 6 IRG signature was an independent prognostic factor for AML. The prognostic role of the immune related-gene signature was further validated using an independent AML dataset, GSE37642. In addition, patients in the high risk score group in the TCGA dataset were found to be of an advanced age, IDH mutation, and M5 FAB category. These results suggested that the proposed immune related-gene signature may serve as a potential prognostic tool for AML patients.","['Zhu, Ruiqi', 'Tao, Huishan', 'Lin, Wenyi', 'Tang, Liang', 'Hu, Yu']","['Zhu R', 'Tao H', 'Lin W', 'Tang L', 'Hu Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201120,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'data mining', 'immune-related gene signature', 'immunogenomic landscape', 'prognosis prediction']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 05:52'],"['2020/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:52 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.574939 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 20;10:574939. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.574939. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhu, Tao, Lin, Tang and Hu.']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",,,,,,PMC7714942,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a long non-coding transcript in the NR4A3 locus and pursued the characterization of this anonymous transcript and the study of its role in leukemogenesis. We characterized this novel long non-coding transcript as a sense polyadenylated transcript. Bone marrow cells from AML patients expressed significantly reduced levels of lncNR4A3 compared to healthy controls (controls = 15, MDS= 20, p=0.05., AML= 21, p<0.01). Expression of NR4A3, as previously reported, was also significantly reduced in AML. Interestingly, the expression of both coding and non-coding transcripts was highly correlated (Pearson R = 0.3771, P<0.01). Transient over-expression of LncNR4A3 by nucleofection led to an increase in the RNA and protein level of NR4A3, reduction of proliferation in myeloid cell lines K-562 and KG1 (n=3 and 2 respectively, p<0.05) and reduced colony formation capacity in primary leukemic cells. A mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics approach was used to identify proteins dysregulated after lncNR4A3 over-expression in K-562. Enrichment analysis showed that the altered proteins are biologically connected (n=4, p<0.001) and functionally associated to RNA binding, transcription elongation, and splicing. Remarkably, we were able to validate the most significant results by WB. We showed that this novel transcript, lncNR4A3 regulates NR4A3 and we hypothesize this regulatory mechanism is mediated by the modulation of the RNA processing machinery.","['Congrains, Ada', 'Niemann, Fernanda Soares', 'Duarte, Adriana Da Silva Santos', 'Ferro, Karla Priscila Vieira', 'Olalla-Saad, Sara Teresinha']","['Congrains A', 'Niemann FS', 'Duarte ADSS', 'Ferro KPV', 'Olalla-Saad ST']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201123,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['NR4A3', 'RNA processing', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'long non-coding RNA', 'myeloid malignancy']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 05:52'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:52 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.569668 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 23;10:569668. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.569668. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Congrains, Niemann, Duarte, Ferro and Olalla-Saad.']","['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.']",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7719789,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we identified key immune genes and cellular components in AML by an integrated bioinformatics analysis, trying to find potential targets for AML. Eighty-six differentially expressed immune genes (DEIGs) were identified from 751 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AML patients with fair prognosis and poor prognosis from the TCGA database. Among them, nine prognostic immune genes, including NCR2, NPDC1, KIR2DL4, KLC3, TWIST1, SNORD3B-1, NFATC4, XCR1, and LEFTY1, were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis. A multivariable prediction model was established based on prognostic immune genes. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis indicated that patients in the high-risk group had a shorter survival rate and higher mortality than those in the low-risk group (P < 0.001), indicating good effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, nuclear factors of activated T cells-4 (NFATC4) was recognized as the key immune gene identified by co-expression of differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs) and prognostic immune genes. ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) were the downstream KEGG pathway of NFATC4, identified by gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). To explore the immune responses NFATC4 was involved in, an immune gene set of T cell co-stimulation was identified by single-cell GSEA (ssGSEA) and Pearson correlation analysis, positively associated with NFATC4 in AML (R = 0.323, P < 0.001, positive). In order to find out the immune cell types affected by NFATC4, the CIBERSORT algorithm and Pearson correlation analysis were applied, and it was revealed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) have the highest correlation with NFATC4 (R = 0.526, P < 0.001, positive) in AML from 22 subsets of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. The results of this study were supported by multi-omics database validation. In all, our study indicated that NFATC4 was the key immune gene in AML poor prognosis through recruiting Tregs, suggesting that NFATC4 might serve as a new therapy target for AML.","['Zhao, Chong', 'Yang, Shaoxin', 'Lu, Wei', 'Liu, Jiali', 'Wei, Yanyu', 'Guo, Hezhou', 'Zhang, Yanjie', 'Shi, Jun']","['Zhao C', 'Yang S', 'Lu W', 'Liu J', 'Wei Y', 'Guo H', 'Zhang Y', 'Shi J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201127,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['NFATc4', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immune response', 'prognosis', 'regulatory T cells']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 05:51'],"['2020/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:51 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.573124 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Nov 27;11:573124. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.573124. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhao, Yang, Lu, Liu, Wei, Guo, Zhang and Shi.']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7728998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic origin is a defect in the interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain (IL2RG) gene and patients are classically characterized by absence of T and NK cells, as well as presence of partially-functional B cells. Without any treatment the disease is usually lethal during the first year of life. The treatment of choice for these patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with an excellent survival rate (>90%) if an HLA-matched sibling donor is available. However, when alternative donors are used, the success and survival rates are often lower. Gene therapy has been developed as an alternative treatment initially using gamma-retroviral vectors to correct the defective gamma chain in the absence of pre-conditioning treatment. The results were highly promising in SCID-X1 infants, showing long-term T-cell recovery and clinical benefit, although NK and B cell recovery was less robust. However, some infants developed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after the gene therapy, due to vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis. Consequently, considerable efforts have been made to develop safer vectors. The most recent clinical trials using lentiviral vectors together with a low-dose pre-conditioning regimen have demonstrated excellent sustained T cell recovery, but also B and NK cells, in both children and adults.

JAK2 inhibitors improve the quality of life for MPN patients, but these approved therapeutics do not readily reduce the natural course of disease or antagonize the neoplastic clone. An understanding of the molecular and cellular changes requisite for MPN development and progression are needed to develop improved therapies. Recently, murine MPN models were demonstrated to exhibit metabolic vulnerabilities due to a high dependence on glucose. Neoplastic hematopoietic progenitor cells in these mice express elevated levels of glycolytic enzymes and exhibit enhanced levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and the disease phenotype of these MPN model mice is antagonized by glycolytic inhibition. While all MPN-driving mutations lead to aberrant JAK2 activation, these mutations often co-exist with mutations in genes that encode epigenetic regulators, including loss of function mutations known to enhance MPN progression. In this perspective we discuss how altered activity of epigenetic regulators (e.g., methylation and acetylation) in MPN-driving stem and progenitor cells may alter cellular metabolism and contribute to the MPN phenotype and progression of disease. Specific metabolic changes associated with epigenetic deregulation may identify patient populations that exhibit specific metabolic vulnerabilities that are absent in normal hematopoietic cells, and thus provide a potential basis for the development of more effective personalized therapeutic approaches.","['Sharma, Vasundhara', 'Wright, Kenneth L', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K', 'Reuther, Gary W']","['Sharma V', 'Wright KL', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Reuther GW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201130,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*EZHZ2', '*HDAC11', '*JAK2', '*epigenetic', '*metabolism', '*myeloproliferative neoplasm', '*stem cell', '*therapy']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/17 05:51'],"['2020/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:51 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.604142 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 30;11:604142. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.604142. eCollection 2020.,20210621,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Sharma, Wright, Epling-Burnette and Reuther.']","['Department of Leukemia, Princess Margaret Cancer Center-University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, United States.', 'Ibis Therapeutics, Tampa, FL, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, United States.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Energy Metabolism/drug effects/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Phenotype']","['GR receives research funding from Incyte Corporation and Revolution Medicines,', 'Inc. for projects not related to this manuscript.

T-cell exhaustion, immune checkpoint upregulation, and increase of regulatory T cells contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. As a result, CLL patients are severely susceptible to infectious complications that increase morbidity and mortality. CLL B-cell survival is highly dependent upon interaction with the supportive tumor microenvironment. It has been postulated that the reversal of T-cell dysfunction in CLL may be beneficial to reduce tumor burden. Previous studies have also highlighted roles for histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in regulation of immune cell phenotype and function. Here, we report for the first time that HDAC6 inhibition exerts beneficial immunomodulatory effects on CLL B cells and alleviates CLL-induced immunosuppression of CLL T cells. In the Emu-TCL1 adoptive transfer murine model, genetic silencing or inhibition of HDAC6 reduced surface expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on CLL B cells and lowered interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. This occurred concurrently with a bolstered T-cell phenotype, demonstrated by alteration of coinhibitory molecules and activation status. Analysis of mice with similar tumor burden indicated that the majority of T-cell changes elicited by silencing or inhibition of HDAC6 in vivo are likely secondary to decrease of tumor burden and immunomodulation of CLL B cells. The data reported here suggest that CLL B cell phenotype may be altered by HDAC6-mediated hyperacetylation of the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and subsequent inhibition of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Based on the beneficial immunomodulatory activity of HDAC6 inhibition, we rationalized that HDAC6 inhibitors could enhance immune checkpoint blockade in CLL. Conclusively, combination treatment with ACY738 augmented the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in the Emu-TCL1 adoptive transfer murine model. These combinatorial antitumor effects coincided with an increased cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell phenotype. Taken together, these data highlight a role for HDAC inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy and provides the rationale to investigate HDAC6 inhibition together with immune checkpoint blockade for treatment of CLL patients.","['Maharaj, Kamira', 'Powers, John J', 'Mediavilla-Varela, Melanie', 'Achille, Alex', 'Gamal, Wael', 'Quayle, Steven', 'Jones, Simon S', 'Sahakian, Eva', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Maharaj K', 'Powers JJ', 'Mediavilla-Varela M', 'Achille A', 'Gamal W', 'Quayle S', 'Jones SS', 'Sahakian E', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201123,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell', '*HDAC6', '*PD-1', '*PD-L1', '*T cell', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*histone deacetylase', '*immune checkpoint']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2020/12/17 05:50'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.590072 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 23;11:590072. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.590072. eCollection 2020.,20210727,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Maharaj, Powers, Mediavilla-Varela, Achille, Gamal, Quayle,', 'Jones, Sahakian and Pinilla-Ibarz.']","['Department of Immunology, H.

Rituximab activates the complement system in vitro, but there is an ongoing debate on the exact role of this effector mechanism in therapeutic effect. Results of both in vitro and in vivo studies are model-dependent and preclude clear clinical conclusions. Additional confounding factors like complement inhibition by tumor cells, loss of target antigen and complement depletion due to excessively applied immunotherapeutics, intrapersonal variability in the concentration of main complement components and differences in tumor burden all suggest that a personalized approach is the best strategy for optimization of rituximab dosage and therapeutic schedule. Herein we critically review the existing knowledge in support of such concept and present original data on markers of complement activation, complement consumption, and rituximab accumulation in plasma of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). The increase of markers such as C4d and terminal complement complex (TCC) suggest the strongest complement activation after the first administration of rituximab, but not indicative of clinical outcome in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. Both ELISA and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) functional assay showed that a substantial number of patients accumulate rituximab to the extent that consecutive infusions do not improve the cytotoxic capacity of their sera. Our data suggest that individual assessment of CDC activity and rituximab concentration in plasma may support clinicians' decisions on further drug infusions, or instead prescribing a therapy with anti-CD20 antibodies like obinutuzumab that more efficiently activate effector mechanisms other than complement.","['Felberg, Anna', 'Taszner, Michal', 'Urban, Aleksandra', 'Majeranowski, Alan', 'Jaskula, Kinga', 'Jurkiewicz, Aleksandra', 'Stasilojc, Grzegorz', 'Blom, Anna M', 'Zaucha, Jan M', 'Okroj, Marcin']","['Felberg A', 'Taszner M', 'Urban A', 'Majeranowski A', 'Jaskula K', 'Jurkiewicz A', 'Stasilojc G', 'Blom AM', 'Zaucha JM', 'Okroj M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201119,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*complement system', ""*non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", '*obinutuzumab (GA101)', '*rituximab']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/12/17 05:50'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.584509 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 19;11:584509. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.584509. eCollection 2020.,20210616,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Felberg, Taszner, Urban, Majeranowski, Jaskula, Jurkiewicz,', 'Stasilojc, Blom, Zaucha and Okroj.']","['Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/immunology', 'Rituximab/*pharmacology']",,,,PMC7710700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, we found that soluble VISTA released by AML cells enhances the effect of galectin-9, most likely by forming multiprotein complexes on the surface of T cells and possibly creating a molecular barrier.

In this Review, we highlight the different genetic pathways impacted by germline mutations that can ultimately lead to the development of familial and sporadic haematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Many of the genes disrupted by somatic mutations in these diseases (for example, TP53, RUNX1, IKZF1 and ETV6) are the same as those that harbour germline mutations in children and adolescents who develop these malignancies. Moreover, the presumption that familial leukaemias only present in childhood is no longer true, in large part due to the numerous studies demonstrating germline DDX41 mutations in adults with MDS and AML. Lastly, we highlight how different cooperating events can influence the ultimate phenotype in these different familial leukaemia syndromes.","['Klco, Jeffery M', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Klco JM', 'Mullighan CG']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2961-6960', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1850']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201216,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

Macrophages entrap pathogens into a phagosome and subsequently acidic lysosomes fuse to the phagosome. Previous studies showed the pivotal role of actin-remodeling mediated by phosphoinositide-related signaling in phagosome formation, but the mechanisms of phagosome-lysosome fusion remain unexplored. Here we show that in complement-mediated phagocytosis, phagosome-lysosome fusion requires the disappearance of F-actin structure surrounding the phagosome and a tyrosine kinase Syk plays a key role in this process. Using macrophage-like differentiated HL60 and Syk-knockout (Syk-KO) HL60 cells, we found that Syk-KO cells showed insufficient phagosome acidification caused by impaired fusion with lysosomes and permitted the survival of Candida albicans in complement-mediated phagocytosis. Phagosome tracking analysis showed that during phagosome internalization process, F-actin surrounding phagosomes disappeared in both parental and Syk-KO cells but this structure was reconstructed immediately only in Syk-KO cells. In addition, F-actin-stabilizing agent induced a similar impairment of phagosome-lysosome fusion. Collectively, Syk-derived signaling facilitates phagosome-lysosome fusion by regulating actin-remodeling.","['Tabata, Hiroyuki', 'Morita, Hiroyuki', 'Kaji, Hiroaki', 'Tohyama, Kaoru', 'Tohyama, Yumi']","['Tabata H', 'Morita H', 'Kaji H', 'Tohyama K', 'Tohyama Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201216,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2020/12/17 05:43'],"['2020/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 05:43 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-79156-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-79156-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Dec 16;10(1):22086. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-79156-7.,20210503,,"['Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kami-ohno, Himeji, Hyogo, 670-8524, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kami-ohno, Himeji, Hyogo, 670-8524, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kami-ohno, Himeji, Hyogo, 670-8524, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kami-ohno, Himeji, Hyogo, 670-8524, Japan. ytohyama@gm.himeji-du.ac.jp.']","['0 (Actins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']","['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement System Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lysosomes/genetics', 'Macrophages/metabolism/pathology', 'Phagocytosis/*genetics', 'Phagosomes/*genetics', 'Syk Kinase/*genetics']",,,,PMC7744523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 64 patients aged less than 18 years old with pro-BALL were enrolled. Clinical characteristics, therapeutic effect and prognostic factors were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Pro-B-ALL occurred in 6.23% (64/1 028) of pediatric ALL. Among the 64 patients, 35 were male and 29 were female. The median age was 7.0 years (range 0.4-16.0 years) at diagnosis, of which 39% and 6% were >/= 10 years old and < 1 year old respectively. The median WBC count was 25.5x10(9)/L[range (0.4-831.9)x10(9)/L], of which 35.9% were >/= 50x10(9)/L. MLL-r positivity was the most frequent genetic alteration in pro-B ALL, occurring in 34% of patients, with lower frequency of CD22 and CD13 expression and higher frequency of CD7 expression, while lower frequency of CD33 expression was found in patients with MLL-AF4 positivity. At a median follow-up of 60.0 months (range 4.9-165.3 months), the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in the 64 patients were (85+/-5)% and (78+/-5)% respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified MRD >/= 0.1% at 3 months after chemotherapy as an independent adverse prognostic factor for both 5-year OS and EFS. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric pro-B ALL is a heterogeneous disease with clinical and biological diversity. Biological characteristics, such as immunological markers, genetic alterations, and MRD at 3 months after chemotherapy may be important factors for the long-term prognosis.","['Xue, Yu-Juan', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Wang, Yu', 'Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Zhang, Le-Ping']","['Xue YJ', 'Lu AD', 'Wang Y', 'Jia YP', 'Zuo YX', 'Zhang LP']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/12/17 05:31'],"['2020/12/17 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2008090 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Dec;22(12):1286-1294.,20210202,,"[""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']","['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,PMC7735923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: MRD has the most definite prognostic significance in pediatric B-ALL patients with negative fusion gene, while it has unsatisfactory prognostic significance in those with positive ETV6-RUNX1 or positive E2A-PBX1.","['Wei, Tong', 'Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Zhang, Lu-Yang', 'Zhang, Ao-Li', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Wei T', 'Chen XJ', 'Zhang LY', 'Zhang AL', 'Zhu XF']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/12/17 05:31'],"['2020/12/17 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2007097 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Dec;22(12):1279-1285.,20210202,,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']","['Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,PMC7735931,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upregulation of lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) has been reported in endometrial cancer (EC) tissues. This prospective study aimed to determine the potential clinical significance of serum lncRNA DLEU1 in EC. METHODS: The serum lncRNA DLEU1 level was detected in EC patients, patients with endometrial hyperplasia and healthy controls by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Then its clinical value in EC was further evaluated. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that serum lncRNA DLEU1 levels were significantly increased in patients with EC, and serum lncRNA DLEU1 showed good performance for discriminating EC patients from patients with endometrial hyperplasia and healthy controls. In addition, EC patients with advanced clinicopathological features had higher circulating lncRNA DLEU1 level than those with favorable clinical characteristics. Moreover, EC patients in the high serum lncRNA DLEU1 group suffered worse overall survival and disease-free survival than those in the low serum lncRNA DLEU1 group. Furthermore, multivariate cox regression analysis displayed that the serum lncRNA DLEU1 served as an independent prognostic factor for EC. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study suggests that serum lncRNA DLEU1 is a novel and promising biomarker for prognostic estimation of EC.","['Shan, Lixia', 'Zhao, Tao', 'Wang, Yu']","['Shan L', 'Zhao T', 'Wang Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9009-5175'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*endometrial cancer', '*long non-coding RNAs', '*prognosis prediction', '*serum DLEU1', '*survival']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2020/12/17 05:29'],"['2020/12/17 05:29 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820965589 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820965589. doi: 10.1177/1533033820965589.,20211108,,"[""Department of Gynecology, Shijiazhuang People's Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Shijiazhuang People's Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Shijiazhuang People's Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (DLEU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']","['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Precancerous Conditions/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*blood/genetics']",,,,PMC7750898,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with CLL treated with venetoclax as monotherapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 05/2012 and 01/2016 were included and pretreatment bone marrow was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BCL-W, BCL-XL, BCL2-A1 and MCL-1. Twenty-seven patients were included. BCL-W + and BCL-2A1+ was found in 15% and 7% of the patients, respectively. Both BCL-XL and MCL-1 were negative in all samples. A higher CR and longer PFS rates were observed in patients with BCL-W+ (p = .60, p = .46), BCL-2A1+ (p = .60, p = .29), and either BCL-W + or BCL-2A1+ (p = .33, p = .20), though not statistically significant.

Thus, reliable and robust in vivo model systems are needed to perform reverse genetic experiments. Ideally, these models should allow for a conditional silencing of the target and an unambiguous identification of engineered cancer cells. Here, we present a platform consisting of: (i) t(8;21) and t(15;17) driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transgenic mice with constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and inducible expression of Cre recombinase, and (ii) REX, a modified pSico lentiviral vector for inducible shRNA expression and red fluorescent protein (RFP) as a selection marker. In this system, leukemic cells from transgenic mice are transduced with REX, flow sorted, and transplanted into syngeneic hosts. Gene interference is induced in established tumors by tamoxifen treatment. Dual-color cell fluorescence guides the in vivo identification of shRNA interfered AML cells, monitoring engraftment and disease progression. We tested the platform by inducing knockdown of Zeb2, a gene upregulated by AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha oncogenes in pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem cell compartment, and observed a significant delay in leukemia onset. This proves the power and utility of the platform and confirms Zeb2 contribution to the pathogenesis of AML.","['De Conti, Giulia', 'Gruszka, Alicja M', 'Valli, Debora', 'Cammarata, Andrea Umberto', 'Righi, Matteo', 'Mazza, Massimiliano', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['De Conti G', 'Gruszka AM', 'Valli D', 'Cammarata AU', 'Righi M', 'Mazza M', 'Pelicci PG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2647-228X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5359-0281', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9053-5743']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201214,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AML1-ETO', 'PML-RAR', 'candidate genes', 'mouse model']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 01:02'],"['2020/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123768 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123768 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 14;12(12). pii: cancers12123768. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123768.,,,"['Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Immunotherapy, Cell Therapy and Biobank, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori""-IRST S.r.l, 47014 Meldola, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,PMC7765008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer effect of this compound against lung cancer cells. The results show that ABN-B inhibited the proliferation of four human lung cancer cell lines (A549, BZR, H1975, and H226) and induced apoptosis, based on the cleavage of caspase-7 and PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase), as well as the downregulation of Bcl-2. ABN-B also induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M by down-regulating the expression of CKD1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) and cyclin B1, but up-regulating p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1) expression. Notably, ABN-B increased the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, treatment with mito-TEMPO (a specific mitochondrial antioxidant) blocked ABN-B-induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and apoptosis, as well as the up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of CDK1 and cyclin B1 induced by ABN-B. At the molecular level, ABN-B-induced mitochondrial ROS production increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT (protein kinase B) and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), while the inhibition of these kinases blocked the ABN-B-induced up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of CDK1 and cyclin B1. Moreover, ABN-B significantly suppressed tumor growth in Ex-3LL (Lewis lung carcinoma) tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, these results suggest that ABN-B can exert an anti-cancer effect by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M through mitochondrial ROS production in lung cancer cells.","['Phan, Thanh Nam', 'Kim, Okwha', 'Ha, Manh Tuan', 'Hwangbo, Cheol', 'Min, Byung-Sun', 'Lee, Jeong-Hyung']","['Phan TN', 'Kim O', 'Ha MT', 'Hwangbo C', 'Min BS', 'Lee JH']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7280-0654', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6505-3080', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2651-1645']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201214,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Albanol B', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle arrest', 'lung cancer', 'mitochondrial reactive oxygen species']",2020/12/18 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/12/17 01:02'],"['2020/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249502 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249502 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 14;21(24). pii: ijms21249502. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249502.,20210315,,"['Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Gangwon-Do 24414, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Gangwon-Do 24414, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Catholic University of Daegu, Gyeongbuk 38430, Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Plus), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Catholic University of Daegu, Gyeongbuk 38430, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Gangwon-Do 24414, Korea.']","['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (albanol B)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzofurans/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,['2018R1D1A1B07047187 and 2020R1A5A8019180/National Research Foundation of Korea'],PMC7764986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tendency in hematology imposes additional requirements on the identification of molecular-genetic features of tumor clones. MicroRNA (miRNA, miR) expression levels correlate with cytogenetic and molecular subtypes of acute leukemias recognized by classification systems. The aim of this work is analyzing the miRNA expression profiles in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and hematopoietic conditions induced by non-tumor pathologies (NTP). METHODS: A total of 114 cytological samples obtained by sternal puncture and aspiration biopsy of bone marrow (22 ALLs, 44 AMLs, and 48 NTPs) were analyzed by real-time PCR regarding preselected 25 miRNAs. For the classification of the samples, logistic regression was used with balancing of comparison group weights. RESULTS: Our results indicated potential feasibility of (i) differentiating ALL+AML from a nontumor hematopoietic pathology with 93% sensitivity and 92% specificity using miR-150:miR-21, miR-20a:miR-221, and miR-24:nf3 (where nf3 is a normalization factor calculated from threshold cycle values of miR-103a, miR-191, and miR-378); (ii) diagnosing ALL with 81% sensitivity and 81% specificity using miR-181b:miR-100, miR-223:miR-124, and miR-24:nf3; and (iii) diagnosing AML with 81% sensitivity and 84% specificity using miR-150:miR-221, miR-100:miR-24, and miR-181a:miR-191. CONCLUSION: The results presented herein allow the miRNA expression profile to de used for differentiation between AL and NTP, no matter what AL subtype.","['Kovynev, Igor B', 'Titov, Sergei E', 'Ruzankin, Pavel S', 'Agakishiev, Mechti M', 'Veryaskina, Yuliya A', ""Nedel'ko, Viktor M"", 'Pospelova, Tatiana I', 'Zhimulev, Igor F']","['Kovynev IB', 'Titov SE', 'Ruzankin PS', 'Agakishiev MM', 'Veryaskina YA', ""Nedel'ko VM"", 'Pospelova TI', 'Zhimulev IF']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9401-5737', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5262-3037', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3799-9407']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201214,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloblastic leukemia', 'microRNA']",2020/12/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:01,['2020/12/17 01:02'],"['2020/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines8120607 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8120607 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Dec 14;8(12). pii: biomedicines8120607. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8120607.,,,"['Department of Therapy, Hematology and Transfusiology, Novosibirsk State Medical University, 630091 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'AO Vector-Best, 630117 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Sobolev Institute of Mathematics, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, Novosibirsk State University, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Therapy, Hematology and Transfusiology, Novosibirsk State Medical University, 630091 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Hematology, City Clinical Hospital #2, 630051 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Gene Engineering, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Sobolev Institute of Mathematics, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, Novosibirsk State University, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Therapy, Hematology and Transfusiology, Novosibirsk State Medical University, 630091 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.']",,,,,"['20-14-00074/Russian Science Foundation', '19-34-60024/Russian Foundation for Basic Research', '075-15-2019-1675/Mathematical Center in Akademgorodok under agreement', '0314-2019-0015/state contract of Sobolev Institute of Mathematics']",PMC7764834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MS mostly develops in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and involves primarily the skin, soft tissues, bones, and lymph nodes. Pleura and pericardium involvement of MS are extremely uncommon. Polyserositis is also a very rare extramedullary presentation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 30-year-old woman with a complaint of right neck mass combined with coughing for 2 months as well as fever and systemic edema for the last 10 days, was admitted to our center on July 11, 2019. Initial positron emission tomography (PET) scan indicated systemic lymphadenopathy, bilateral pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. DIAGNOSIS: The initial pathological diagnosis of lymph nodes was MS. Subsequent bone marrow analysis confirmed AML. INTERVENTIONS: Conventional IA induction regimen followed by high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) regimen. OUTCOMES: Complete absorption of pericardial and pleural effusion after the first cycle of IA induction chemotherapy. LESSONS: Polyserositis can be an extramedullary presentation of AML. Patients with polyserositis should undergo routine flow cytometric analysis. For AML with extamedullary infiltration, systemic chemotherapy should be administered in all confirmed cases.","['Pi, Yubo', 'Wang, Beining', 'Wang, Lihong', 'Ren, Hanyun']","['Pi Y', 'Wang B', 'Wang L', 'Ren H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8971-5517'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/12/17 01:02'],"['2020/12/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000023615 [doi]', '00005792-202012110-00114 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Dec 11;99(50):e23615. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000023615.,20210106,,"['Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']","['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pericardial Effusion/etiology', 'Pleural Effusion/etiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,,,PMC7738120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a firmly established treatment, but patients without fully matched donors have poor prognoses. Disease recurrence is the main cause of treatment failure. Meanwhile, most cases with splenomegaly present with platelet transfusion refractoriness, but splenectomy remains controversial. DNA hypermethylation correlates with poor prognosis in JMML; however, hypomethylating therapy alone does not eradicate leukemic clones. Thus, a suitable treatment with a good success rate remains elusive. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we report our experience with a patient who suffered from recurrent fever, pallor, abdominal distention, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with a silent past history and family history of somatic KRAS mutation. The patient was treated with decitabine as a bridging therapy before haploidentical HSCT. Decitabine was also used prophylactically after transplantation. DIAGNOSIS: We arrived at a JMML diagnosis after observing leukocytosis, less than 20% blast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, increased monocyte counts, negativity for the BCR-ABL fusion gene, positivity for somatic KRAS mutation, and massive splenomegaly. INTERVENTIONS: The patient accepted splenectomy before HSCT, and haploidentical HSCT was applied after treatment with a DNA-hypomethylating agent. The hypomethylating agent was administered for 1 year after HSCT to prevent disease recurrence. OUTCOMES: The patient presented with complete remission of the disease and mild graft versus host disease for 26 months after treatment with decitabine and HSCT. LESSONS: Combining haploidentical HSCT and DNA-hypomethylating agents may improve the prognosis of JMML. Meanwhile, splenectomy could be an effective option in cases with massive splenomegaly and platelet transfusion refractoriness.","['Ai, Yuan', 'Lu, Xiaoxi', 'Zhu, Tingting', 'Zhu, Yiping', 'Liu, Hanmin', 'Sun, Shuwen']","['Ai Y', 'Lu X', 'Zhu T', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu H', 'Sun S']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/12/17 01:02'],"['2020/12/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000023606 [doi]', '00005792-202012110-00110 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Dec 11;99(50):e23606. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000023606.,20210106,,"['Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']","['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/therapy']",,,,PMC7738035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the limited number of samples with SET-NUP214 fusion gene in previous studies, the significance of SET-NUP214 for measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring in patients with acute leukemia (AL) is still unclear. Our study aimed to observe the dynamic changes in SET-NUP214 expression before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and analyzed whether SET-NUP214 could be used to evaluate MRD status. Our study included 24 AL patients who were newly diagnosed with SET-NUP214 fusion gene and they all received allo-HSCT. Their MRD was evaluated by monitoring SET-NUP214 fusion gene and leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP). The median follow-up time was 501 days (56-2208 days). Of the enrolled patients, 6 (25%) patients died, including 3 (12.5%) patients died of leukemia relapse. Total 5 (20.8%) patients experienced hematological relapse at a median of 225 days (56-1057 days) post-transplantation. The SET-NUP214 median expression level at diagnosis was 405.1% (14.6%-1482.4%). SET-NUP214 gene expression generally became positive prior to flow cytometry results. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis showed that those who had SET-NUP214 positive (SET-NUP214+) post-transplantation had a higher 2-year cumulative incidence of leukemia relapse (CIR) of 43.7 +/- 18.8% (P < .05). However, there was no significant difference between SET-NUP214 positive and SET-NUP214 negative patients with regard to their 2-year overall survival (OS) (82.5 +/- 11.3 vs 64.6 +/- 17.5%, respectively, P = .271). ROC curve analysis turned out that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.916 (95% CI: 0.784-1.0; P = .005). In conclusion, SET-NUP214 fusion gene determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) could be used to evaluate MRD status after allo-HSCT. Patients with positive SET-NUP214 expression after transplantation will have a poor prognosis.","['Gao, Meng-Ge', 'Hong, Yan', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Zhao, Xiao-Su']","['Gao MG', 'Hong Y', 'Qin YZ', 'Chang YJ', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang XH', 'Xu LP', 'Huang XJ', 'Zhao XS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/12/17 01:02'],"['2020/12/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000023569 [doi]', '00005792-202012110-00097 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Dec 11;99(50):e23569. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000023569.,20210107,,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing.', 'Research Unit of Key Technique for Diagnosis and Treatments of Hematologic Malignancies, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell."", 'Research Unit of Key Technique for Diagnosis and Treatments of Hematologic Malignancies, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, China.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (SET protein, human)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Histone Chaperones/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'ROC Curve', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,,PMC7738098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early detection is crucial for good prognosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 20-year-old female went to hospital for fever, and was unexpectedly diagnosed as JPS during treatment. She reported no clinical signs or family history of JPS. DIAGNOSIS: Blood routine examination on hospital admission suggested a moderate anemia. Bone marrow cytology and leukemia fusion gene test were performed to rule out leukemia. Other examinations including ultrasound and computed tomography were also conducted for differential diagnosis. Further electronic colonoscopy identified more than 20 pedicle polyps located at her ileocecum and rectum. Mutation analysis detected a novel de novo pathogenic variant, c.910C>T (p.Gln304Ter) within bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A gene, establishing the diagnosis of JPS. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with endoscopic interventions. We also provided a genetic counseling for this family. OUTCOMES: The patient's polyps were removed, some of which already had adenomatous changes. The patient received surveillance of hereditary colorectal cancer according to guidelines.

The method of diagnosis and mechanism of immune regulation in ATLL are discussed in the present report. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old Chinese man was admitted to the hospital with 2-years history of systemic plaque lesions and 1-year history of left ankle joint pain. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with ATLL based on the results of flow cytometry immunophenotype and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) serology. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/ vinorelbine, and dexamethasone (CHOP) chemotherapy. However, he relapsed and did not respond to epirubicin, vindesine, etoposide, dexamethasone (EPOCH) chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: His family discontinued the treatment and opted for hospice care. LESSONS: Patch and plaque ATLL types exhibits a better survival rate, but atypical skin patches delays the diagnosis of ATLL and negatively affects the patient survival. Based on the present findings, we suggest that patients with petal-like nuclear lymphocytes in blood smears, a high CD4: CD8 ratio, and strong CD25 expression should undergo HTLV-1 serology testing.","['Lei, Chen Shuang', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Yu, Qinhua', 'Qiu, Liannv']","['Lei CS', 'Jiang Q', 'Yu Q', 'Qiu L']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/12/17 01:01'],"['2020/12/17 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000023491 [doi]', '00005792-202012110-00065 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Dec 11;99(50):e23491. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000023491.,20210104,,"['College of Medical Technology, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", 'College of Medical Technology, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.""]","['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'EPOCH protocol', 'VAP-cyclo protocol']","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Skin Diseases/etiology', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,,,PMC7738110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systemic mastocytosis with an associated clonal hematologic non-MC lineage disease is the second most common subtype of systemic mastocytosis. The most common mutation associated with both systemic mastocytosis and myeloid sarcoma is mutation in Kit. Here, we identified the novel KIT D816V and ARID1A G1254S mutations co-occurring in systemic mastocytosis with myeloid sarcoma. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 33-year old male patient presented multiple skin lesions for 10 years. Symptoms accelerated in 2017 with decreased body weight. Physical examination revealed enlarged lymph nodes in his neck, axilla and inguinal region; conjunctival hemorrhage; gingival hyperplasia. Skin biopsy showed mast cell infiltration. Flow cytometry detected CD2, CD25 and CD117 positive cells in lymph nodes. Codon 816 KIT mutation D816V and codon 1245 ARID1A mutation G1254S were found in peripheral blood. MPO, CD117, CD68 positive cells in lymph nodes indicated co-existing myeloid sarcoma. DIAGNOSIS: Systemic mastocytosis with an associated clonal hematologic non-MC lineage disease of myeloid sarcoma INTERVENTIONS:: Cytarabine and daunorubicin for myeloid sarcoma and dasatinib for systemic mastocytosis were initiated. Anti-histamine and anti-leukotrienes therapy were used to prevent NSAIDs-induced shock. Platelets were infused to treat bone marrow suppression. OUTCOMES: Patient was discharged after recovered from bone marrow suppression. Dasatinib continued on outpatient. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of patient with systemic mastocytosis and myeloid sarcoma simultaneously presenting extensive skin involvements. Mutations of Kit and Arid1a emphasis the importance to notice possibility of various tumors occurring in patients with multiple mutations. In addition, cysteine-leukotrienes-receptor antagonists should always be used to prevent anaphylactic shock due to mast cell activation.","['Wang, Xinye', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Zhou, Daobin', 'Cai, Hao', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Jiang, Xianyong']","['Wang X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhou D', 'Cai H', 'Wang X', 'Jiang X']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,,2020/12/18 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/12/17 01:01'],"['2020/12/17 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000021948 [doi]', '00005792-202012110-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Dec 11;99(50):e21948. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000021948.,20210111,,"['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']","['0 (ARID1A protein, human)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'CD2 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Histamine Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukotriene Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*complications/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Platelet Transfusion/methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,PMC7738061,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this information is not routinely used because TMB is usually obtained from whole genome or exome, or from large gene panel high-throughput sequencing. METHODS: Here, we used the C-Harrel concordance index to determine the minimum panel of genes for which mutations predict treatment-free survival (TFS) as well as large resequencing panels. RESULTS: An eight gene estimator was defined encompassing ATM, SF3B1, NOTCH1, BIRC3, XPO1, MYD88, TNFAIP3, and TP53. TMB estimated from either a large panel of genes or the eight gene estimator was increased in treated patients or in those with a short TFS (<2 years), unmutated IGHV gene or with an unfavorable karyotype. Being an independent prognostic parameter, any mutation in the eight gene estimator predicted a shorter TFS better than Binet stage and IGHV mutational status among patients with an apparently non-progressive disease (TFS >6 months). Strikingly, the eight gene estimator was also highly informative for patients with Binet stage A CLL or with a good prognosis karyotype. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the eight gene estimator, that is easily achievable by high-throughput resequencing, brings robust and valuable information that predicts evolution of untreated patients at diagnosis better than any other parameter.","['Chauzeix, Jasmine', 'Pastoret, Cedric', 'Donaty, Lucie', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Fest, Thierry', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Rizzo, David']","['Chauzeix J', 'Pastoret C', 'Donaty L', 'Gachard N', 'Fest T', 'Feuillard J', 'Rizzo D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8283-6295'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20201216,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'high-throughput sequencing', 'prognosis', 'tumor mutational burden']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2020/12/16 08:46'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/16 08:46 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13435 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Aug;43(4):683-692. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13435.

Osteocytes are the primary mechanical load-sensing cells in the bone, and can regulate osteoblast and osteoclast activity, thus playing a key role in bone remodeling. Further, bone mass during exercise is also regulated by Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This study aimed to investigate the role of LIF in the mechanical response of the bone, in vivo and in vitro, and to elucidate the mechanism by which osteocytes secrete LIF to regulate osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Methods: A tail-suspension (TS) mouse model was used in this study to mimic muscular disuse. ELISA and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect bone and serum LIF levels. Micro-computed tomography (CT) of the mouse femurs was performed to measure three-dimensional bone structure parameters. Fluid shear stress (FSS) and microgravity simulation experiments were performed to study mechanical stress-induced LIF secretion and its resultant effects. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured to induce in vitro osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis, respectively. Results: Micro-CT results showed that TS mice exhibited deteriorated bone microstructure and lower serum LIF expression. LIF secretion by osteocytes was promoted by FSS and was repressed in a microgravity environment. Further experiments showed that LIF could elevate the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in BMM-derived osteoclasts through the STAT3 signaling pathway. LIF also enhanced alkaline phosphatase staining and osteogenesis-related gene expression during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Conclusion: Mechanical loading affected LIF expression levels in osteocytes, thereby altering the balance between osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis.","['Du, Jingke', 'Yang, Jiancheng', 'He, Zihao', 'Cui, Junqi', 'Yang, Yiqi', 'Xu, Mingming', 'Qu, Xinhua', 'Zhao, Ning', 'Yan, Mengning', 'Li, Hanjun', 'Yu, Zhifeng']","['Du J', 'Yang J', 'He Z', 'Cui J', 'Yang Y', 'Xu M', 'Qu X', 'Zhao N', 'Yan M', 'Li H', 'Yu Z']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201126,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone remodeling', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'osteoblasts', 'osteoclasts', 'osteocytes']",2020/12/17 06:00,2020/12/17 06:01,['2020/12/16 05:38'],"['2020/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmolb.2020.585056 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2020 Nov 26;7:585056. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2020.585056. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Du, Yang, He, Cui, Yang, Xu, Qu, Zhao, Yan, Li and Yu.']","[""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Spinal Surgery, People's Hospital of Longhua Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China; School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China; Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Arthritis Clinic and Research Center, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Bone and Joint Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Orthodontics, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7726425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It delivers immunosuppressive signals through its receptor CD200R, which is expressed on monocytes/myeloid cells and T lymphocytes. Moreover, interaction of CD200 with CD200R has also been reported to play a role in the regulation of tumor immunity. Overexpression of CD200 has been reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia but not in mantle cell lymphoma, thus helping to better discriminate between these different B cell malignancies with different prognosis. In this review, we focus on the role of CD200 expression in the differential diagnosis of mature B-cell neoplasms and on the prognostic significance of CD200 expression in CLL, where conflicting results have been published so far. Of interest, increasing evidences indicate that anti-CD200 treatment might be therapeutically beneficial for treating CD200-expressing malignancies, such as CLL.","[""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'De Feo, Vincenzo', 'Pietrantuono, Giuseppe', 'Seneca, Elisa', 'Mansueto, Giovanna', 'Villani, Oreste', 'La Rocca, Francesco', ""D'Auria, Fiorella"", 'Statuto, Teodora', 'Valvano, Luciana', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Sgambato, Alessandro', 'Laurenti, Luca']","[""D'Arena G"", 'De Feo V', 'Pietrantuono G', 'Seneca E', 'Mansueto G', 'Villani O', 'La Rocca F', ""D'Auria F"", 'Statuto T', 'Valvano L', 'Arruga F', 'Deaglio S', 'Efremov DG', 'Sgambato A', 'Laurenti L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201126,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD200', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'diagnosis', 'flow cytometry', 'prognosis']",2020/12/17 06:00,2020/12/17 06:01,['2020/12/16 05:37'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.584427 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 26;10:584427. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.584427. eCollection 2020.,,"[""Copyright (c) 2020 D'Arena, De Feo, Pietrantuono, Seneca, Mansueto, Villani, La"", ""Rocca, D'Auria, Statuto, Valvano, Arruga, Deaglio, Efremov, Sgambato and"", 'Laurenti.']","['Hematology, ""S.

Incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in APL patients and non-APL patients was 55.82% and 28.4% (p = 0.0003). The initial levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were higher in APL patients than in control (all p < 0.0001). In APL patients, triglyceride levels were significantly increased during induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic. Multivariable analysis showed that age, being overweight (body mass index >/=25) and APL were independent risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia in all patients before treatment. High triglyceride levels were not significantly associated with disease-free survival or overall survival in the APL patients. In summary, in the current study triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in APL patients before treatment, and they increased during induction treatment, but there were no significant

Because of their critical roles in HSC maintenance the niches formed by MSPCs and ECs are commonly referred to as HSC niches. For the most part, the signals required for HSC maintenance act in a short-range manner, which imposes the necessity for directional and positional cues in order for HSCs to localize and be retained properly in stem cell niches. The chemokine CXCL12 and its Galphai protein coupled receptor CXCR4, besides promoting HSC quiescence directly, also play instrumental roles in enabling HSCs to access bone marrow stem cell niches. Recent studies have revealed, however, that HSC niches also provide a constellation of hematopoietic cytokines that are critical for the production of most, if not all, blood cell types. Some hematopoietic cytokines, namely IL-7 and IL-15 produced by HSC niches, are not only required for lymphopoiesis but are also essential for memory T cell maintenance. Consequently, hematopoietic progenitors and differentiated immune cells, such as memory T cell subsets, also depend on the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis for migration into bone marrow and interactions with MSPCs and ECs. Similarly, subsets of antibody-secreting plasma cells also reside in close association with CXCL12-producing MSPCs in the bone marrow and require the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis for survival and long-term maintenance. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a broad range of key physiological roles, spanning blood cell production and maintenance of immunological memory, that are orchestrated by stem cell niches through a common and simple mechanism: CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated cell recruitment followed by receipt of a maintenance and/or instructive signal. A fundamental flaw of this type of cellular organization is revealed by myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, which target stem cell niches and induce profound transcriptomic changes that result in reduced hematopoietic activity and altered mesenchymal cell differentiation.","['Miao, Runfeng', 'Lim, Vivian Y', 'Kothapalli, Neeharika', 'Ma, Yifan', 'Fossati, Julia', 'Zehentmeier, Sandra', 'Sun, Ruifeng', 'Pereira, Joao P']","['Miao R', 'Lim VY', 'Kothapalli N', 'Ma Y', 'Fossati J', 'Zehentmeier S', 'Sun R', 'Pereira JP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20201126,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCR4', '*WHIM syndrome', '*hematopoietic stem cell niches', '*leukemia', '*lymphopoiesis', '*myelopoiesis']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/12/16 05:37'],"['2020/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.600127 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 26;11:600127. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.600127. eCollection 2020.,20210616,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Miao, Lim, Kothapalli, Ma, Fossati, Zehentmeier, Sun and', 'Pereira.']","['Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Department of Immunobiology and Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.']",,"['Animals', 'Endothelial Cells/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Stem Cell Niche/*immunology']","['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,"['R01 AI113040/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI146648/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7726109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report that the cell surface expression of IL-33-specific receptor, Interleukin 1 Receptor Like 1 (IL1RL1), is elevated in BM cells from AML patients at diagnosis, and the serum level of IL-33 in AML patients is higher than that of healthy donor controls. Moreover, IL-33 levels are found to be positively associated with IL-6 levels in pediatric patients with AML. In vitro, IL-33 treatment increased IL-6 mRNA expression and protein level in BM and peripheral blood (PB) cells from AML patients. Evidence was also provided that IL-33 inhibits cell apoptosis by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway using human AML cell line and AML patient samples. Finally, we confirmed that IL-33 activated IL-6 expression in a manner that required p38 MAPK pathway using clinical AML samples. Taken together, we identified a potential mechanism of IL-33-mediated survival involving p38 MAPK in pediatric AML patients that would facilitate future drug development.","['Wang, Yiqian', 'Su, Haibo', 'Yan, Muxia', 'Zhang, Li', 'Tang, Jiancheng', 'Li, Quanxin', 'Gu, Xiaoqiong', 'Gong, Qing']","['Wang Y', 'Su H', 'Yan M', 'Zhang L', 'Tang J', 'Li Q', 'Gu X', 'Gong Q']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201126,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*interleukin 1 receptor Like 1 (IL1RL1)', '*interleukin-33 (IL-33)', '*interleukin-6 (IL-6)', '*p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/16 05:37'],"['2020/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.595053 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 26;11:595053. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.595053. eCollection 2020.,20210617,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wang, Su, Yan, Zhang, Tang, Li, Gu and Gong.']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Clinical Biological Resource Bank and Clinical Lab, Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']","['0 (IL33 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-33)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']","['Cell Survival/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-33/*immunology', 'Interleukin-6/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*immunology']","['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7726021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor T cells prevent disease recurrence via graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Donor T cells also contribute to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a debilitating and potentially fatal complication. Novel treatment strategies are needed which allow preservation of GVL effects without causing GVHD. Using murine models, we show that targeting IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) in donor T cells reduces GVHD while preserving GVL effects. Both CD8(+) and CD4(+) donor T cells from Itk(-/-) mice produce less inflammatory cytokines and show decrease migration to GVHD target organs such as the liver and small intestine, while maintaining GVL efficacy against primary B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Itk(-/-) T cells exhibit reduced expression of IRF4 and decreased JAK/STAT signaling activity but upregulating expression of Eomesodermin (Eomes) and preserve cytotoxicity, necessary for GVL effect. Transcriptome analysis indicates that ITK signaling controls chemokine receptor expression during alloactivation, which in turn affects the ability of donor T cells to migrate to GVHD target organs. Our data suggest that inhibiting ITK could be a therapeutic strategy to reduce GVHD while preserving the beneficial GVL effects following allo-HSCT treatment.","['Mammadli, Mahinbanu', 'Huang, Weishan', 'Harris, Rebecca', 'Sultana, Aisha', 'Cheng, Ying', 'Tong, Wei', 'Pu, Jeffery', 'Gentile, Teresa', 'Dsouza, Shanti', 'Yang, Qi', 'Bah, Alaji', 'August, Avery', 'Karimi, Mobin']","['Mammadli M', 'Huang W', 'Harris R', 'Sultana A', 'Cheng Y', 'Tong W', 'Pu J', 'Gentile T', 'Dsouza S', 'Yang Q', 'Bah A', 'August A', 'Karimi M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201126,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Eomesodermin (EOMES)', '*GVHD after blood transfusion', '*GvL', '*ITK deficiency', '*JAK-STAT signalling pathway', '*T cell']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/16 05:37'],"['2020/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.593863 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 26;11:593863. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.593863. eCollection 2020.,20210621,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Mammadli, Huang, Harris, Sultana, Cheng, Tong, Pu, Gentile,', 'Dsouza, Yang, Bah, August and Karimi.']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States.', ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", 'Department of Hematology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbial Disease, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbial Disease, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, United States.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (emt protein-tyrosine kinase)']","['Animals', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*genetics/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunomodulation', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']","['AA receives research support from 3M Corporation.

We hypothesized that cancer risk would be lower among those with motor neuron disease and its most common subtype, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study of motor neuron disease and cancer risk using routinely collected data from population-based registries in Denmark. We examined cancer incidence among patients diagnosed with motor neuron disease between January 1980 and December 2013 followed through 2013. Using Danish national cancer rates for the study period, we computed standardized incidence ratios as a measure of relative risks. Results: In the cohort of 5053 patients with a motor neuron disease, the overall standardized incidence ratio of any cancer was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.31); the corresponding standardized incidence ratio for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.96-1.57). The standardized incidence ratios of any cancer in the cohort with motor neuron disease was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.22-1.87) for <1 year of follow-up; 0.87 (95% CI, 0.68-1.09) for years 1-5 of follow-up; and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01-1.46) for >5 years of follow-up. Beyond one year of follow-up, patients in the motor neuron disease had elevated standardized incidence ratios for lymphoid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and basal cell skin cancer. Conclusion: Findings fail to support the hypothesis that motor neuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with reduced cancer incidence. An elevated risk of cancer during the first year of follow-up may be attributable to heightened surveillance.","['Sorensen, Trine Toft', 'Farkas, Dora Kormendine', 'Riahi, Emil Zal Bjerregaard', 'Ehrenstein, Vera', 'Henderson, Victor W']","['Sorensen TT', 'Farkas DK', 'Riahi EZB', 'Ehrenstein V', 'Henderson VW']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8363-963X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6733-4019', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3415-3254', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1198-9240']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201208,New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,['NOTNLM'],"['amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'cancer', 'cohort', 'motor neuron disease', 'neurodegeneration', 'risk']",2020/12/17 06:00,2020/12/17 06:01,['2020/12/16 05:35'],"['2020/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 05:35 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S271543 [doi]', '271543 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2020 Dec 8;12:1347-1353. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S271543. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Sorensen et al.'],"['Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,"['P30 AG066515/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 AG047366/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7733394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Re fi nement of risk strati fi cation may aid the identi fi cation of patients who are likely to relapse. Abnormal cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) has been implicated in various cancers, but its function remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of CSRP2 in predicting adult AML recurrence. Methods: RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of CSRP2 in 193 newly diagnosed adult AML patients and 44 healthy controls. The competitive risk model was used to calculate the cumulative incidence of relapse rate (CIR), Kaplan-Meier to calculate the relapse-free survival rate (RFS), and the Cox regression model to perform multivariate analysis. Viral transfection was used to construct AML cell lines with stable knockdown of CSRP2, CCK8 to detect proliferation and drug resistance, flow cytometry to detect cell cycle and apoptosis, and Western blot to detect key molecules in signaling pathways. Results: CSRP2 transcript levels were higher in 193 adult AML compared with 44 healthy controls. In 149 patients who achieved complete remission, those with high CSRP2 transcript levels displayed a lower 2-year CIR and higher 2-year RFS, especially when receiving only chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, a high CSRP2 transcript level was independently associated with a better RFS. Knockdown of CSRP2 promoted proliferation and cell cycle progression, and reduced chemosensitivity. Western blot analysis showed upregulation of p-AKT and p-CREB in CSRP2-knockdown AML cell lines. Inhibition assays suggested these two signaling pathways participated in the CSRP2-mediated proliferation effects in AML cell lines. Conclusion: In summary, CSRP2 correlates with relapse in adult AML. Down-regulation of CSRP2 could promote the proliferation of AML cell lines by regulating the AKT and CREB signaling pathways. Therefore, CSRP2 may provide prognostic signi fi cance and potential therapeutic targets in the management of AML.","['Wang, Shujuan', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Liu, Yajun', 'Zheng, Ruyue', 'Wu, Zhenzhen', 'Fan, Yi', 'Li, Mengya', 'Li, Menglin', 'Li, Tao', 'Li, Yafei', 'Jiang, Zhongxing', 'Wang, Chong', 'Liu, Yanfang']","['Wang S', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zheng R', 'Wu Z', 'Fan Y', 'Li M', 'Li M', 'Li T', 'Li Y', 'Jiang Z', 'Wang C', 'Liu Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6196-0513', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0568-737X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201207,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein', 'cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2', 'proliferation', 'relapse']",2020/12/17 06:00,2020/12/17 06:01,['2020/12/16 05:35'],"['2020/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 05:35 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S281802 [doi]', '281802 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Dec 7;13:12549-12560. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S281802. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],"[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Orthopaedics, Brown University, Warren Alpert Medical School/Rhode Island Hospital, Rhode Island, RI, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,PMC7733086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) favored autoHSCT with 74.5% (95% CI 69-79.2) and 82.4% (95% CI 77.3-86.5) compared with alloHSCT with 54.7% (95% CI 47.5-61.3) (p = 0.001) and 64.3% (95% CI 57.2-70.6), respectively (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed significantly worse LFS after alloHSCT (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.37-0.67; p < 0.0001), older age (p = 0.001), and shorter time from diagnosis to transplant (p = 0.00015). Similar results were obtained for OS. The study shows that autoHSCT resulted in better survival outcomes (LFS and OS) for APL in CR2. These results were mainly due to reduced NRM in the autoHSCT as compared to alloHSCT.","['Sanz, Jaime', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Sousa, Aida Botelho', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Campos, Antonio', 'Grillo, Giovanni', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde Nur', 'Cornelissen, J J', 'Remenyi, Peter', 'Martino, Massimo', 'Porras, Rocio Parody', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Sanz J', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz MA', 'Aljurf M', 'Sousa AB', 'Craddock C', 'Zuckerman T', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Campos A', 'Grillo G', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Remenyi P', 'Martino M', 'Porras RP', 'Nagler A', 'Gorin NC', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6934-4619', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4514-4748', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1489-1177', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5041-6678', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6204-977X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3987-419X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0763-1265']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201215,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,,2020/12/17 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2020/12/16 05:32'],"['2020/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/16 05:32 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-01162-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-01162-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Jun;56(6):1272-1280. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-01162-0.

METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (58 eyes) of CMV necrotizing retinopathy after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in our institute between January 2018 and June 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, and cases that developed neovascular complications during follow-up were identified and described. RESULTS: Two (2 eyes) cases that developed neovascular glaucoma from CMV necrotizing retinopathy were identified. Both of them manifested as granular peripheral retinitis, panretinal occlusive vasculitis, and some degree of intraocular inflammation, which were consistent with chronic retinal necrosis. Insidious progression of isolated immune-mediated occlusive vasculitis that could only be observed on fundus fluorescein angiography without active retinitis or intraocular inflammation was recognized to be the cause in one of two cases. CONCLUSION: Neovascular glaucoma developed in 5.1%/cases and 3.4%/eyes complicated by CMV chronic retinal necrosis and vasculitis in patients after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which warrants the needs for long-term follow-up. Immune-mediated CMV vasculitis could be an isolated manifestation in patients with a minimal immune deviation and may only be found on fundus fluorescein angiography, which emphasizes the importance of fundus fluorescein angiography on a regular basis during follow-up.","['Long, Ze', 'Hou, Jing', 'Miao, Heng']","['Long Z', 'Hou J', 'Miao H']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Retina,"Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.)",8309919,IM,,,2020/12/17 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/16 05:30'],"['2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/16 05:30 [entrez]']","['00006982-202107000-00022 [pii]', '10.1097/IAE.0000000000003040 [doi]']",ppublish,Retina. 2021 Jul 1;41(7):1526-1532. doi: 10.1097/IAE.0000000000003040.,20211210,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

However, its effects following ischemic stroke remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of DNLP in experimental models of inflammation and apoptosis. METHODS: Inflammation and apoptosis were induced by in vivo ischemia/reperfusion and by in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). In the in vivo model, immediately after the induction of cerebral ischemia, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg DNLP were injected intraperitoneally. We subsequently detected indicators of neuronal damage. RESULTS: Treatment with Dendrobium nobile Lindl. polysaccharide significantly reduced cerebral ischemic injury. After in vivo and in vitro middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion or OGD/R-induced hypoxia injury, miR-134 expression in neurons was significantly increased. Altering the expression of miR-134 induced changes in myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), one of its target proteins. In addition, DNLP significantly downregulated the in vivo and in vitro expression of miR-134 after ischemic injury, and influenced inflammation and apoptotic proteins by altering the level of MCL-1 protein. DNLP also had a protective effect on neurons damaged by OGD/R, which could improve cell survival rates and inhibit lactate dehydrogenase release as well as apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: DNLP may protect the brain and neurons from hypoxic damage in mice with ischemic stroke by activating MCL-1 and downregulating miR-134, providing a new therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","['Liu, Jing', 'Han, Yu', 'Zhu, Tao', 'Yang, Qing', 'Wang, Heming', 'Zhang, Hao']","['Liu J', 'Han Y', 'Zhu T', 'Yang Q', 'Wang H', 'Zhang H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Neuroreport,Neuroreport,9100935,IM,,,2020/12/17 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2020/12/16 05:29'],"['2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/16 05:29 [entrez]']","['00001756-202102010-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/WNR.0000000000001562 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroreport. 2021 Feb 3;32(3):177-187. doi: 10.1097/WNR.0000000000001562.,20211220,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Voriconazole is the recommended treatment for CNS-A. The therapeutic effect of voriconazole is good, but its use is limited due to adverse reactions. This case report describes a 37-year-old male patient that had previously been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. He had received immunosuppressive agents for 1 year following a haematopoietic bone marrow transplant. He presented with a 1-month history of left limb weakness as well as recurrent fever. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed that he had multiple cerebral infarctions. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with CNS-A by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Voriconazole was added to his treatment regimen, but it resulted in severe haemorrhagic cystitis and possibly bladder rupture. The dose of voriconazole was adjusted and reparative bladder surgery was undertaken immediately. Eventually, the patient was successfully treated with voriconazole and there was no recurrence of symptoms after 1 year of follow-up. Haemorrhagic cystitis is a rare adverse drug reaction associated with voriconazole use. Based on the experience with this current case, physicians should be aware of urinary tract complications with voriconazole including haemorrhagic cystitis.","['Zeng, Zhaohao', 'Luo, Hong', 'Huang, Kunyu', 'Xue, Lianfang', 'Liu, Hui', 'Li, Xiaoting', 'Wang, Lu', 'Cen, Haimei', 'Bi, Wei', 'Zhang, Yu']","['Zeng Z', 'Luo H', 'Huang K', 'Xue L', 'Liu H', 'Li X', 'Wang L', 'Cen H', 'Bi W', 'Zhang Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2371-2791'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Int Med Res,The Journal of international medical research,0346411,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Central nervous system aspergillosis (CNS-A)', 'adverse drug reaction', 'cerebral infarction', 'voriconazole']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/16 05:23'],"['2020/12/16 05:23 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0300060520974924 [doi]'],ppublish,J Int Med Res. 2020 Dec;48(12):300060520974924. doi: 10.1177/0300060520974924.,20210514,,"['Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.']","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']","['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/adverse effects', '*Aspergillosis/drug therapy', '*Cystitis/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Voriconazole/adverse effects']",,,,PMC7745564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next to variabilities in patient-specific parameters influencing treatment decisions and outcome, this is due to differences in AML biology. In fact, different genetic drivers may transform variable cells of origin and co-exist with additional genetic lesions (e.g., as observed in clonal hematopoiesis) in a variety of leukemic (sub)clones. Moreover, AML cells are hierarchically organized and contain subpopulations of more immature cells called leukemic stem cells (LSC), which on the cellular level constitute the driver of the disease and may evolve during therapy. This genetic and hierarchical complexity results in a pronounced phenotypic variability, which is observed among AML cells of different patients as well as among the leukemic blasts of individual patients, at diagnosis and during the course of the disease. Here, we review the current knowledge on the heterogeneous landscape of AML surface markers with particular focus on those identifying LSC, and discuss why identification and targeting of this important cellular subpopulation in AML remains challenging.","['Arnone, Marlon', 'Konantz, Martina', 'Hanns, Pauline', 'Paczulla Stanger, Anna M', 'Bertels, Sarah', 'Godavarthy, Parimala Sonika', 'Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Lengerke, Claudia']","['Arnone M', 'Konantz M', 'Hanns P', 'Paczulla Stanger AM', 'Bertels S', 'Godavarthy PS', 'Christopeit M', 'Lengerke C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4319-3119', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4627-0412', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5442-2805']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201212,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cellular heterogeneity', 'leukemic stem cells', 'markers', 'relapse']",2020/12/17 06:00,2020/12/17 06:01,['2020/12/16 01:04'],"['2020/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123742 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123742 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 12;12(12). pii: cancers12123742. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123742.,,,"['Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Hebelstrasse 20, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Hebelstrasse 20, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Hebelstrasse 20, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Internal Medicine II, Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Department for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Str. 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine II, Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Department for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Str. 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine II, Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Department for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Str. 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine II, Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Department for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Str. 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Hebelstrasse 20, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Internal Medicine II, Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Department for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Str. 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.']",,,,,"['310030_179239/Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der', 'Wissenschaftlichen Forschung']",PMC7764578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to identify proteomic differences in hearts of growth-restricted and unrestricted mice, and propose mechanisms related to impairment in adulthood. Friend leukemia virus B (FVB) mouse dams were fed a control (CON: 20% protein), or low-protein (LP: 8% protein) isocaloric diet 2 weeks before mating. LP dams produce 20% less milk, inducing growth restriction. At birth (postnatal; PN1), pups born to dams fed the CON diet were switched to LP dams (PGR group) or a different CON dam. At PN21, a sub-cohort of CON (n = 3 males; n = 3 females) and PGR (n = 3 males; n = 3 females) were euthanized and their proteome analyzed by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) and mass spectroscopy. Western blotting and silver nitrate staining confirmed 2D DIGE results. Littermates (CON: n = 4 males and n = 4 females; PGR: n = 4 males and n = 4 females) were weaned to the CON diet. At PN77, echocardiography measured cardiac function. At PN80, hearts were removed for western blotting to determine if differences persisted into adulthood. 2D DIGE and western blot confirmation indicated PGR had reductions in p57(kip2), Titin (Ttn), and Collagen (Col). At PN77, PGR had impaired cardiac function as measured by echocardiography. At PN80, western blots of p57(kip2) showed protein abundance recovered from PN21. PN80 silver staining of large molecular weight proteins (Ttn and Col) was reduced in PGR. PGR reduces cell cycle activity at PN21, which is recovered in adulthood. However, collagen fiber networks are altered into adulthood.","['Visker, Joseph R', 'Dangott, Lawrence J', 'Leszczynski, Eric C', 'Ferguson, David P']","['Visker JR', 'Dangott LJ', 'Leszczynski EC', 'Ferguson DP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8490-6111'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201212,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['DOHaD', 'cardiac function', 'collagen', 'p57kip2', 'postnatal growth restriction', 'titin']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/12/16 01:04'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249459 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249459 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 12;21(24). pii: ijms21249459. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249459.,20210319,,"['Department of Kinesiology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'The Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Protein Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA.', 'Department of Kinesiology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Department of Kinesiology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.']","['0 (Connectin)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (Proteome)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Connectin/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57/metabolism', 'Diet, Protein-Restricted', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Gene Ontology', 'Heart/*growth & development/physiology', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tibia/growth & development', 'Weaning']",,,['T32 DK091317/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7763900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At remission, we assume that these changes normalise so that omics-profiles resemble those of healthy individuals. However, an in-depth transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer remission has not been undertaken. A striking exemplar of targeted remission induction occurs in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) following tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Using RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we profiled samples from chronic-phase CML patients at diagnosis and remission and compared these to healthy donors. Remarkably, our analyses revealed that abnormal splicing distinguishes remission samples from normal controls. This phenomenon is independent of the TKI drug used and in striking contrast to the normalisation of gene expression and DNA methylation patterns. Most remarkable are the high intron retention (IR) levels that even exceed those observed in the diagnosis samples. Increased IR affects cell cycle regulators at diagnosis and splicing regulators at remission. We show that aberrant splicing in CML is associated with reduced expression of specific splicing factors, histone modifications and reduced DNA methylation. Our results provide novel insights into the changing transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of CML patients during remission. The conceptually unanticipated observation of widespread aberrant alternative splicing after remission induction warrants further exploration. These results have broad implications for studying CML relapse and treating minimal residual disease.","['Schmitz, Ulf', 'Shah, Jaynish S', 'Dhungel, Bijay P', 'Monteuuis, Geoffray', 'Luu, Phuc-Loi',

In particular, impaired efficacy of the gold standards of induction therapy in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has been correlated with AKR1C3 expression, as this enzyme metabolises several drugs including anthracyclines. Therefore, the development of selective AKR1C3 inhibitors may help to overcome chemoresistance in clinical practice. In this regard, we demonstrated that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors ibrutinib and acalabrutinib efficiently prevented daunorubicin (Dau) inactivation mediated by AKR1C3 in both its recombinant form as well as during its overexpression in cancer cells. This revealed a synergistic effect of BTK inhibitors on Dau cytotoxicity in cancer cells expressing AKR1C3 both exogenously and endogenously, thus reverting anthracycline resistance in vitro. These findings suggest that BTK inhibitors have a novel off-target action, which can be exploited against leukaemia through combination regimens with standard chemotherapeutics like anthracyclines.","['Morell, Anselm', 'Cermakova, Lucie', 'Novotna, Eva', 'Lastovickova, Lenka', 'Haddad, Melodie', 'Haddad, Andrew', 'Portillo, Ramon', 'Wsol, Vladimir']","['Morell A', 'Cermakova L', 'Novotna E', 'Lastovickova L', 'Haddad M', 'Haddad A', 'Portillo R', 'Wsol V']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2322-4096', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3745-7648']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201211,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKR1C3', ""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'acalabrutinib', 'anthracyclines', 'ibrutinib', 'multidrug resistance']",2020/12/17 06:00,2020/12/17 06:01,['2020/12/16 01:04'],"['2020/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123731 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123731 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 11;12(12). pii: cancers12123731. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123731.,,,"['Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",,,,,"['CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000841/Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy', 'SVV 260 416/Univerzita Karlova v Praze']",PMC7764606,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide a synopsis of the main advances in understanding the role of ATRA and its receptors in dermatology.","['Szymanski, Lukasz', 'Skopek, Rafal', 'Palusinska, Malgorzata', 'Schenk, Tino', 'Stengel, Sven', 'Lewicki, Slawomir', 'Kraj, Leszek', 'Kaminski, Pawel', 'Zelent, Arthur']","['Szymanski L', 'Skopek R', 'Palusinska M', 'Schenk T', 'Stengel S', 'Lewicki S', 'Kraj L', 'Kaminski P', 'Zelent A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8669-3359', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0399-5280', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0539-0680', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6509-5993']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201211,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*all-trans-retinoic acid', '*dermatology', '*retinoic acid receptors', '*vitamin A']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/12/16 01:03'],"['2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9122660 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9122660 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Dec 11;9(12). pii: cells9122660. doi: 10.3390/cells9122660.,20210622,,"['Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Genetics and Animal Biotechnology, Polish Academy of Science, Postepu 36A, 05-552 Magdalenka, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Genetics and Animal Biotechnology, Polish Academy of Science, Postepu 36A, 05-552 Magdalenka, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Genetics and Animal Biotechnology, Polish Academy of Science, Postepu 36A, 05-552 Magdalenka, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Clinic of Internal Medicine II, Jena University Hospital, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine Jena (CMB), Jena University Hospital, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Disease, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, 01-163 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences and Health Sciences, Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology and Humanities, 26-600 Radom, Poland.', 'Department of Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, 01-163 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Gynecology and Oncological Gynecology, Military Institute of Medicine, 01-163 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Genetics and Animal Biotechnology, Polish Academy of Science, Postepu 36A, 05-552 Magdalenka, Poland.']","['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']","['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Skin/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,,PMC7764495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations occur in genes encoding members of the cellular machinery controlling transcription and chromatin structure, including transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, DNA-methyltransferases, but also signaling molecules that activate inducible transcription factors controlling gene expression and cell growth. Mutant cells in AML patients are unable to differentiate and adopt new identities that are shaped by the original driver mutation and by rewiring their gene regulatory networks into regulatory phenotypes with enhanced fitness. One of the best-studied AML-subtypes is the t(8;21) AML which carries a translocation fusing the DNA-binding domain of the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 to the ETO gene. The resulting oncoprotein, RUNX1/ETO has been studied for decades, both at the biochemical but also at the systems biology level. It functions as a dominant-negative version of RUNX1 and interferes with multiple cellular processes associated with myeloid differentiation, growth regulation and genome stability. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of how this protein reprograms normal into malignant cells and how our current knowledge could be harnessed to treat the disease.","['Kellaway, Sophie', 'Chin, Paulynn S', 'Barneh, Farnaz', 'Bonifer, Constanze', 'Heidenreich, Olaf']","['Kellaway S', 'Chin PS', 'Barneh F', 'Bonifer C', 'Heidenreich O']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201213,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*21)', '*RUNX1/ETO', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chromatin', '*epigenetic reprogramming', '*gene regulatory networks', '*personalized medicine', '*t(8']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/16 01:03'],"['2020/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9122681 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9122681 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Dec 13;9(12). pii: cells9122681. doi: 10.3390/cells9122681.,20210621,,"['Institute of Cancer and Genomica Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomica Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Princess Maxima Centrum for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomica Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.', 'Princess Maxima Centrum for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']","['Animals', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Mutation', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,"['MR/S021469/1/Medical Research Council UK/International', 'C27943/A12788/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC7763303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major concern is that the most majority of individuals with HTLV-1 are asymptomatic carriers and that there is limited global attention by health care officials, setting up potential conditions for increased viral spread. HTLV-1 transmission occurs primarily through sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, intravenous drug usage, and breast feeding. Currently, there is no cure for HTLV-1 infection and only limited treatment options exist, such as class I interferons (IFN) and Zidovudine (AZT), with poor prognosis. Recently, small membrane-bound structures, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), have received increased attention due to their potential to carry viral cargo (RNA and proteins) in multiple pathogenic infections (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), Zika virus, and HTLV-1). In the case of HTLV-1, EVs isolated from the peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of HAM/TSP patients contained the viral transactivator protein Tax. Additionally, EVs derived from HTLV-1-infected cells (HTLV-1 EVs) promote functional effects such as cell aggregation which enhance viral spread. In this review, we present current knowledge surrounding EVs and their potential role as immune-modulating agents in cancer and other infectious diseases such as HTLV-1 and HIV-1.

Whereas the armamentarium has expanded in the past few years for treating AML, long-term survival outcomes have yet to be proven. To further expand the arsenal for treating AML, we searched for druggable gene targets in AML by analyzing screening data from a lentiviral-based genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas9 library and gene knockout (KO) dependency scores in 15 AML cell lines (HEL, MV411, OCIAML2, THP1, NOMO1, EOL1, KASUMI1, NB4, OCIAML3, MOLM13, TF1, U937, F36P, AML193, P31FUJ). Ninety-four gene KOs met the criteria of (A) specifically essential to AML cell survival, (B) non-essential in non-AML cells, and (C) druggable according to three-dimensional (3D) modeling or ligand-based druggability scoring. Forty-four of 94 gene-KOs (47%) had an already-approved drug match and comprised a drug development list termed ""deKO."" Fifty of 94 gene-KOs (53%) had no drug in development and comprised a drug discovery list termed ""disKO."" STRING analysis and gene ontology categorization of the disKO targets preferentially cluster in the metabolic processes of UMP biosynthesis, IMP biosynthesis, dihydrofolate metabolism, pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis, vitellogenesis, and regulation of T cell differentiation and hematopoiesis.

Its main applications are as an anticancer drug, mostly for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treatment, and in acrylamide reduction when starch-rich foods are cooked at temperatures above 100 degrees C. Its use as a biosensor for asparagine in both industries has also been reported. However, there are certain challenges associated with ASNase applications. Depending on the ASNase source, the major challenges of its pharmaceutical application are the hypersensitivity reactions that it causes in ALL patients and its short half-life and fast plasma clearance in the blood system by native proteases. In addition, ASNase is generally unstable and it is a thermolabile enzyme, which also hinders its application in the food sector. These drawbacks have been overcome by the ASNase confinement in different (nano)materials through distinct techniques, such as physical adsorption, covalent attachment and entrapment. Overall, this review describes the most recent strategies reported for ASNase confinement in numerous (nano)materials, highlighting its improved properties, especially specificity, half-life enhancement and thermal and operational stability improvement, allowing its reuse, increased proteolysis resistance and immunogenicity elimination. The most recent applications of confined ASNase in nanomaterials are reviewed for the first time, simultaneously providing prospects in the described fields of application.","['Nunes, Joao C F', 'Cristovao, Raquel O', 'Freire, Mara G', 'Santos-Ebinuma, Valeria C', 'Faria, Joaquim L', 'Silva, Claudia G', 'Tavares, Ana P M']","['Nunes JCF', 'Cristovao RO', 'Freire MG', 'Santos-Ebinuma VC', 'Faria JL', 'Silva CG', 'Tavares APM']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2028-586X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5165-4766', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8895-0614', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6531-3978', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6469-4871']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201210,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acrylamide mitigation', 'biosensors', 'confinement strategies', 'l-asparaginase', 'nanomaterials', 'therapeutic agents']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:00,['2020/12/16 01:01'],"['2020/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25245827 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25245827 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Dec 10;25(24). pii: molecules25245827. doi: 10.3390/molecules25245827.,20210416,,"['Laboratory of Separation and Reaction Engineering-Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials (LSRE-LCM), Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Rua do Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Chemistry, CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Separation and Reaction Engineering-Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials (LSRE-LCM), Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Rua do Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Chemistry, CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Estadual Paulista-UNESP, Araraquara 14800-903, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Separation and Reaction Engineering-Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials (LSRE-LCM), Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Rua do Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Separation and Reaction Engineering-Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials (LSRE-LCM), Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Rua do Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Chemistry, CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal.']",['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],"['Asparaginase/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Biosensing Techniques', '*Biotechnology', 'Drug Development', 'Food Industry', 'Humans', 'Nanotechnology/methods', 'Protein Engineering', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,"['POCI-01-0145-FEDER-031268/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia', 'UIDB/50011/2020 & UIDP/50011/2020/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia', 'IF/01634/2015/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia', 'DL57/2016/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia', 'SFRH/BD/150671/2020/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia']",PMC7764279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical use of DOX is limited, because of its unspecific mode of action. Since leukemia cells overexpress transferrin (Tf) receptors on their surface, we proposed doxorubicin-transferrin (DOX-Tf) conjugate as a new vehicle to increase drug concentration directly in cancer cells. The data obtained after experiments performed on K562 and CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell lines clearly indicate severe cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of the conjugate drug. On the other hand, normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were more resistant to DOX-Tf than to DOX. In comparison to free drug, we observed that Tf-bound DOX induced apoptosis in a TRAIL-dependent manner and caused DNA damage typical of programmed cell death. These fatal hallmarks of cell death were confirmed upon morphological observation of cells incubated with DOX or DOX-Tf. Studies of expression of TNF-alpha, IL-4, and IL-6 at the mRNA and protein levels revealed that the pro-inflammatory response plays an important role in the toxicity of the conjugate. Altogether, the results demonstrated here describe a mechanism of the antitumor activity of the DOX-Tf conjugate.","['Jedrzejczyk, Monika', 'Wisniewska, Katarzyna', 'Kania, Katarzyna Dominika', 'Marczak, Agnieszka', 'Szwed, Marzena']","['Jedrzejczyk M', 'Wisniewska K', 'Kania KD', 'Marczak A', 'Szwed M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2102-3741'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['doxorubicin', 'inflammation', 'leukemias']",2020/12/17 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/12/16 01:01'],"['2020/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249390 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249390 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 10;21(24). pii: ijms21249390. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249390.,20210304,,"['Department of Medical Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation, Institute for Medical Biology, PAS, Lodowa 106 Street, 93-232 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",,,['B1611000001151.02/University of Lodz'],PMC7764702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, after synthesis of tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles by hydrothermal method, their interaction with human serum albumin (HSA) was evaluated by multispectroscopic and molecular docking (MD) approaches. Furthermore, the selective antiproliferative impact of SnO2 nanoparticles against leukemia K562 cells was assessed by different cellular assays, whereas lymphocytes were used as control cells. TEM, DLS, zeta potential and XRD techniques showed that crystalline SnO2 nanoparticles have a size of less than 50 nm with a good colloidal stability. Fluorescence and CD spectroscopy analysis indicated that the HSA undergoes some slight conformational changes after interaction with SnO2 nanoparticles, whereas the secondary structure of HSA remains intact. Moreover, MD outcomes revealed that the charged residues of HSA preferentially bind to SnO2 nanoclusters in the binding pocket. Antiproliferative examinations displayed that SnO2 nanoparticles can selectively cause the mortality of K562 cells through induction of cell membrane leakage, activation of caspase-9, -8, -3, down regulation of Bcl-2 mRNA, the elevation of ROS level, S phase arrest, and apoptosis. In conclusion, this data may indicate that SnO2 nanoparticles can be used as promising particles to be integrated into therapeutic platforms.","['Ahmadabad, Leila Ebrahimi', 'Kalantari, Firoozeh Samia', 'Liu, Hui', 'Hasan, Anwarul', 'Gamasaee, Niusha Abbasi', 'Edis, Zehra', 'Attar, Farnoosh', 'Ale-Ebrahim, Mahsa', 'Rouhollah, Fatemeh', 'Babadaei, Mohammad Mahdi Nejadi', 'Sharifi, Majid', 'Shahpasand, Koorosh', 'Akhtari, Keivan', 'Falahati, Mojtaba', 'Cai, Yu']","['Ahmadabad LE', 'Kalantari FS', 'Liu H', 'Hasan A', 'Gamasaee NA', 'Edis Z', 'Attar F', 'Ale-Ebrahim M', 'Rouhollah F', 'Babadaei MMN', 'Sharifi M', 'Shahpasand K', 'Akhtari K', 'Falahati M', 'Cai Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201017,Netherlands,Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl,"Materials science & engineering.

Benefited from the narrow tissue specificity of folate receptor beta (FRbeta) aberrantly expressed on hematological linage cell lines, NPs modified with folate acid (FA) has been widely applied for crossing cell membrane barriers in FR-targeted therapies for AML. Thus, the biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by FRbeta were conducted by an albumin modifier as previously synthesized and cationic liposomes. However, how to further enhance the tumor-targeting and cellular uptake of NPs have been great challenges in cancer therapy. It was reported that FRbeta could be selectively augmented by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Herein, we demonstrated the enhanced active tumor-targeting of FA-modified siRNA-loaded biomimetic albumin NPs (Lip-S@FBH) could be achieved by upregulating FRbeta expression via ATRA NPs. And the systematic administration of ATRA NPs significantly promoted endocytosis and thereby increased the intracellular concentration of Lip-S@FBH. This strategy combined the FRbeta amplification effect with the effective delivery of siRNA, is mostly desirable for the AML-targeting therapy.","['Wang, Dandan', 'Li, Hui', 'Chen, Weiliang', 'Yang, Han', 'Liu, Yang', 'You, Bengang', 'Zhang, Xuenong']","['Wang D', 'Li H', 'Chen W', 'Yang H', 'Liu Y', 'You B', 'Zhang X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201009,Netherlands,Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl,"Materials science & engineering.

To identify agents with P-gp inhibitory properties, ethanol extracts from 80 plants were screened for their ability to increase intracellular doxorubicin-associated fluorescence, and the extract of Ligaria cuneifolia was found to be the most effective. Its bioassay-guided isolation yielded the pentacyclic triterpene betulin as active agent. This efficiently inhibited P-gp mediated efflux, as demonstrated by the enhancement of the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 from 1.56 muM in the P-gp overexpressing MDR leukemia cell, Lucena 1. Betulin was also able to render Lucena 1 sensitive to Dox from 0.39 muM. The docking studies revealed that betulin tightly binds to a key region of the TMDs, with a binding mode overlapping one main site of doxorubicin and, more interestingly, emulating the same contacts as tariquidar, as revealed by the per-residue energetic analysis from molecular dynamics simulations. MTT assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hemolysis assay showed that betulin is devoid of toxicity. These findings provide important evidence that betulin may be a safe and promising entity to be further investigated to develop agents able to overcome P-gp-mediated MDR, resulting in a more effective and less toxic chemotherapy.","['Laiolo, Jeronimo', 'Barbieri, Cecilia L', 'Joray, Mariana B', 'Lanza, Priscila A', 'Palacios, Sara M', 'Vera, D Mariano A', 'Carpinella, Maria C']","['Laiolo J', 'Barbieri CL', 'Joray MB', 'Lanza PA', 'Palacios SM', 'Vera DMA', 'Carpinella MC']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201213,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Betulin', 'Betulinic acid', 'Leukemia cells', 'Molecular modeling', 'Multidrug resistance reversal', 'P-glycoprotein']",2020/12/16 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/12/15 20:08'],"['2020/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/15 20:08 [entrez]']","['S0278-6915(20)30812-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2020.111922 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2021 Jan;147:111922. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2020.111922.

Data on risk factors, treatment options, and outcomes are limited. PROCEDURE: In this retrospective multicenter study in which a questionnaire was sent to all pediatric transplant centers reporting relapse after allo-HSCT for a cohort of 938 children with acute leukemia, we analyzed 255 children with relapse of acute leukemia after their first allo-HSCT. RESULTS: The median interval from transplantation to relapse was 180 days, and the median follow-up from relapse to the last follow-up was 1844 days. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 12.0%. The main cause of death was disease progression or subsequent relapse (82.6%). The majority of children received salvage treatment with curative intent without a second HSCT (67.8%), 22.0% of children underwent a second allo-HSCT, and 10.2% received palliative therapy. Isolated extramedullary relapse (hazard ratio (HR): 0.607, P = .011) and relapse earlier than 365 days post-transplantation (HR: 2.101, P < .001 for 0-180 days; HR: 1.522, P = .041 for 181-365 days) were found in multivariate analysis to be significant prognostic factors for outcome. The type of salvage therapy in chemosensitive relapse was identified as a significant prognostic factor for OS. CONCLUSION: A salvage approach with curative intent may be considered for patients with post-transplant relapse, even if they relapse in the first year post-transplantation. For sustainable remission, a second allo-HSCT may be recommended for patients who achieve complete remission after reinduction treatment.","['Hazar, Volkan', 'Tezcan Karasu, Gulsun', 'Ozturk, Gulyuz', 'Kupesiz, Alphan', 'Aksoylar, Serap', 'Ozbek, Namik', 'Uygun, Vedat', 'Ileri, Talia', 'Okur, Fatma Visal', 'Kocak, Ulker', 'Kilic, Suar Caki', 'Akcay, Arzu', 'Guler, Elif', 'Kansoy, Savas', 'Karakukcu, Musa', 'Bayram, Ibrahim', 'Aksu, Tekin', 'Yesilipek, Akif', 'Karagun, Barbaros Sahin', 'Yilmaz, Sebnem', 'Ertem, Mehmet', 'Uckan, Duygu', 'Fisgin, Tunc', 'Gursel, Orhan', 'Yaman, Yontem', 'Bozkurt, Ceyhun', 'Gokce, Muge']","['Hazar V', 'Tezcan Karasu G', 'Ozturk G', 'Kupesiz A', 'Aksoylar S', 'Ozbek N', 'Uygun V', 'Ileri T', 'Okur FV', 'Kocak U', 'Kilic SC', 'Akcay A', 'Guler E', 'Kansoy S', 'Karakukcu M', 'Bayram I', 'Aksu T', 'Yesilipek A', 'Karagun BS', 'Yilmaz S', 'Ertem M', 'Uckan D', 'Fisgin T', 'Gursel O', 'Yaman Y', 'Bozkurt C', 'Gokce M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1407-2334', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9268-8858', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3257-7798', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0841-1667', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4514-8637', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7678-5524', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4640-6159']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201215,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'children', 'post-transplant relapse', 'treatment']",2020/12/16 06:00,2020/12/16 06:00,['2020/12/15 17:14'],"['2020/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/15 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13942 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2021 Aug;25(5):e13942. doi: 10.1111/petr.13942.

Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and the impact is amplified in low and middle-income countries. Defining the epidemiology of infection in a specific health care setting is paramount to developing effective interventions. This study aimed to define the epidemiology of and outcomes from infection in children with acute leukemia treated in a large public pediatric hospital in the Dominican Republic. A retrospective cohort was assembled of children newly diagnosed with acute leukemia between July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2017 at Hospital Infantil Dr. Robert Reid Cabral in Santo Domingo. Patients were identified from the Pediatric Oncology Network Database (PONDTM) and hospital admissions from the Oncology admissions logbook. Medical records and microbiology results were reviewed to identify all inpatient invasive infections. Distance from a child's home to the hospital was determined using ArcGIS by Esri. Infection rates were described in discrete time periods after diagnosis and risk factors for invasive infection were explored using negative binomial regression. Overall, invasive infections were common and a prominent source of death in this cohort. Rates were highest in the first 60 days after diagnosis. Gastroenteritis/colitis, cellulitis, and pneumonia were most frequent, with bacteremia common early on. Multidrug resistant bacteria were prevalent among a small number of positive cultures. In a multivariate negative binomial regression model, age >/= 10 years and distance from the hospital > 100 km were each protective against invasive infection in the first 180 days after diagnosis, findings that were unexpected and warrant further investigation. Over one-third of patient deaths were related to infection. Interventions aimed at reducing infection should target the first 60 days after diagnosis, improved supportive care inside and outside the hospital, and increased antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention and control measures.","['Burns, Julianne E', 'Reyes Perez, Dominga', 'Li, Yimei', 'Gomez Garcia, Wendy', 'Garcia, F Jay', 'Gil Jimenez, Johanna Penelope', 'Sanchez, Jacqueline',

We here assess the response rates, adverse events, and long-term follow-up of pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving blinatumomab. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a single-center experience with blinatumomab in 38 patients over a period of 10 years. RESULTS: The median age at onset of therapy was 10 years (1-21 years). Seventy-one percent of patients had undergone at least one hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) prior to treatment with blinatumomab. We observed a response to blinatumomab in 13/38 patients (34%). The predominant side effect was febrile reactions, nearly half of the patients developed a cytokine release syndrome. Eight events of neurotoxicity were registered over the 78 cycles (15%). To date, nine patients (24%) are alive and in complete molecular remission. All survivors underwent haploidentical HSCT after treatment with blinatumomab. CONCLUSIONS: Despite heavy pretreatment of most of our patients, severe adverse events were rare and response rates encouraging. Blinatumomab is a valuable bridging salvage therapy for relapsed or refractory patients to a second or even third HSCT.","['Queudeville, Manon', 'Schlegel, Patrick', 'Heinz, Amadeus T', 'Lenz, Teresa', 'Doring, Michaela', 'Holzer, Ursula', 'Hartmann, Ulrike', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias', 'Lang, Peter', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Ebinger, Martin']","['Queudeville M', 'Schlegel P', 'Heinz AT', 'Lenz T', 'Doring M', 'Holzer U', 'Hartmann U', 'Kreyenberg H', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Schrappe M', 'Zugmaier G', 'Feuchtinger T', 'Lang P', 'Handgretinger R', 'Ebinger M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5642-1846'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210111,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,,2020/12/16 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/12/15 12:16'],"['2020/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/15 12:16 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13569 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Apr;106(4):473-483. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13569.

The MRD disk can be used for standardisation of repetitive, longitudinal assays with high requirements on reproducibility and sensitivity, such as cancer monitoring. In contrast to high-throughput qPCR automation by bulky and expensive robotic workstations we employ a small centrifugal microfluidic instrument, addressing the need of low- to mid-throughput applications. As a potential application we demonstrate automated minimum residual disease (MRD) monitoring of prognostic markers in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The disk-workflow covers all aspects of clinical gold standard MRD quantification: generation of standard curves, specificity controls, no template controls and quantification of the ALL patient sample. We integrated a highly sensitive, colorimetric 2-plex analysis of MRD targets, as well as a 2-plex analysis of reference genes, both in parallel and in a single LabDisk cartridge. For this purpose, a systematic procedure for crosstalk- and signal-to-noise-optimisation is introduced, providing a guideline for efficient multiplex readout inside microfluidic platforms. The qPCR standard curves (n = 12/12) generated on-disk reach clinically required linearity (R2 = 98.1% to R2 = 99.8%). In three consecutive MRD disk runs with an ALL patient sample containing the two representative MRD targets VH3D3D5JH3 and VkIkde, we observe high accordance between the on-disk quantifications (48 +/- 6 copies/reaction and 69 +/- 6 copies/reaction) and the expected concentrations (57 copies/reaction for both targets). In comparison to the clinical gold standard of manually pipetted, singleplex assays, the MRD disk yields comparable limit of quantification (1 x 10-4) in n = 6/6 analyses (vs. n = 4/4 in gold standard) and a limit of detection (1 x 10-5) in n = 6/6 analysis (vs. n = 2/4 in gold standard). The automation reduces the risk of manual liquid handling errors, making the MRD disk an attractive solution to assure reproducibility in moderate-throughput, longitudinal gene quantification applications.","['Juelg, Peter', 'Kipf, Elena', 'Specht, Mara', 'Fillies, Marion', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Paust, Nils', 'Zengerle, Roland', 'Lehnert, Michael', 'Hutzenlaub, Tobias']","['Juelg P', 'Kipf E', 'Specht M', 'Fillies M', 'Eckert C', 'Paust N', 'Zengerle R', 'Lehnert M', 'Hutzenlaub T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1448-9831', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0890-3709', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9769-391X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,IM,,,2020/12/16 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/15 08:42'],"['2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/15 08:42 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0lc00945h [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2021 Feb 9;21(3):558-570. doi: 10.1039/d0lc00945h.,20210621,,"['Hahn-Schickard, Georges-Koehler-Allee 103, 79110 Freiburg, Germany.

There is a lower response rate to venetoclax monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). METHODS: We tested inhibitors of cap-dependent mRNA translation for the ability to sensitise DLBCL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells to apoptosis by venetoclax. We compared the mTOR kinase inhibitor (TOR-KI) MLN0128 with SBI-756, a compound targeting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G1 (eIF4G1), a scaffolding protein in the eIF4F complex. RESULTS: Treatment of DLBCL and MCL cells with SBI-756 synergised with venetoclax to induce apoptosis in vitro, and enhanced venetoclax efficacy in vivo. SBI-756 prevented eIF4E-eIF4G1 association and cap-dependent translation without affecting mTOR substrate phosphorylation. In TOR-KI-resistant DLBCL cells lacking eIF4E binding protein-1, SBI-756 still sensitised to venetoclax. SBI-756 selectively reduced translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors, leading to a reduction in protein synthesis rates in sensitive cells. When normal lymphocytes were treated with SBI-756, only B cells had reduced viability, and this correlated with reduced protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight a novel combination for treatment of aggressive lymphomas, and establishes its efficacy and selectivity using preclinical models.","['Herzog, Lee-Or', 'Walters, Beth', 'Buono, Roberta', 'Lee, J Scott', 'Mallya, Sharmila', 'Fung, Amos', 'Chiu, Honyin', 'Nguyen, Nancy', 'Li, Boyang', 'Pinkerton, Anthony B', 'Jackson, Michael R', 'Schneider, Robert J', ""Ronai, Ze'ev A"", 'Fruman, David A']","['Herzog LO', 'Walters B', 'Buono R', 'Lee JS', 'Mallya S', 'Fung A', 'Chiu H', 'Nguyen N', 'Li B', 'Pinkerton AB', 'Jackson MR', 'Schneider RJ', 'Ronai ZA', 'Fruman DA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3859-0400', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1796-5162']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201214,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,,2020/12/16 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/12/15 06:02'],"['2020/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/15 06:02 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-01205-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-01205-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2021 Mar;124(6):1098-1109. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-01205-9.

Despite great progress has been made in this field, the pathogenesis of AML is still not fully understood. We report here the biological role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) in the pathogenesis of AML and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that lncRNA SNHG5 was highly expressed in AML cancer cell lines. In vitro studies displayed that inhibition of SNHG5 with shRNA resulted in suppression of survival, cell cycle progression, migration/invasion of AML and capacity of adhesion and angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Mechanistic studies revealed a SNHG5/miR-26b/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) axis in the regulation of AML angiogenesis. Finally, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) was found to transactivate and interact with SNHG5 promoter, leading to the upregulation of SNHG5 in AML. Collectively, upregulation of lncRNA SNHG5 mediated by YY1, activates CTGF/VEGFA via targeting miR-26b to regulate angiogenesis of AML. Our work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AML.","['Li, Zhen-Jiang', 'Cheng, Jing', 'Song, Yuan', 'Li, Hui-Hui', 'Zheng, Ji-Fu']","['Li ZJ', 'Cheng J', 'Song Y', 'Li HH', 'Zheng JF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201214,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,IM,,,2020/12/16 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/12/15 06:01'],"['2020/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/15 06:01 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41374-020-00519-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41374-020-00519-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2021 Mar;101(3):341-352. doi: 10.1038/s41374-020-00519-9.

FCM-MRD performed in 18 laboratories across seven countries was used for risk stratification of 1487 patients with BCP-ALL enrolled in the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. When no informative FCM-marker was available, risk stratification was based on real-time quantitative PCR. An informative FCM-marker was found in 96.2% and only two patients (0.14%) had non-informative FCM and non-informative PCR-markers. The overall 5-year event-free survival was 86.1% with a cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR5y) of 9.5%. FCM-MRD levels on days 15 (HzR 4.0, p < 0.0001), 29 (HzR 2.7, p < 0.0001), and 79 (HzR 3.5, p < 0.0001) associated with hazard of relapse adjusted for age, cytogenetics, and WBC. The early (day 15) response associated with CIR5y adjusted for day 29 FCM-MRD, with higher levels in adults (median 2.4 x 10(-2) versus 5.2 x 10(-3), p < 0.0001). Undetectable FCM- and/or PCR-MRD on day 29 identified patients with a very good outcome (CIR5y = 3.2%). For patients who did not undergo transplantation, day 79 FCM-MRD > 10(-4) associated with a CIR5y = 22.1%.

It has a complex karyotype. A PICALM-MLLT10 fusion gene formed by the recurrent t(10;11) translocation is present, and the myeloid common deleted region at 20q12 has been lost from its near-triploid karyotype. We carried out a detailed investigation of U937 genome reorganisation including the chromosome 20 rearrangements and other complex rearrangements. RESULTS: SNP array, G-banding and Multicolour FISH identified chromosome segments resulting from unbalanced and balanced rearrangements. The organisation of the abnormal chromosomes containing these segments was then reconstructed with the strategic use of targeted metaphase FISH. This provided more accurate karyotype information for the evolving karyotype. Rearrangements involving the homologues of a chromosome pair could be differentiated in most instances. Centromere capture was demonstrated in an abnormal chromosome containing parts of chromosomes 16 and 20 which were stabilised by joining to a short section of chromosome containing an 11 centromere. This adds to the growing number of examples of centromere capture, which to date have a high incidence in complex karyotypes where the centromeres of the rearranged chromosomes are identified. There were two normal copies of one chromosome 20 homologue, and complex rearrangement of the other homologue including loss of the 20q12 common deleted region. This confirmed the previously reported loss of heterozygosity of this region in U937, and defined the rearrangements giving rise to this loss. CONCLUSIONS: Centromere capture, stabilising chromosomes pieced together from multiple segments, may be a common feature of complex karyotypes. However, it has only recently been recognised, as this requires deliberate identification of the centromeres of abnormal chromosomes. The approach presented here is invaluable for studying complex reorganised genomes such as those produced by chromothripsis, and provides a more complete picture than can be obtained by microarray, karyotyping or FISH studies alone. One major advantage of SNP arrays for this process is that the two homologues can usually be distinguished when there is more than one rearrangement of a chromosome pair. Tracking the fate of each homologue and of highly repetitive DNA regions such as centromeres helps build a picture of genome evolution. Centromere- and telomere-containing elements are important to deducing chromosome structure. This study confirms and highlights ongoing evolution in cultured cell lines.","['MacKinnon, Ruth N', 'Peverall, Joanne', 'Campbell, Lynda J', 'Wall, Meaghan']","['MacKinnon RN', 'Peverall J', 'Campbell LJ', 'Wall M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0294-5051', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9497-3513']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201214,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cell lines', 'Centromere capture', 'Dicentric chromosomes', 'Genome evolution', 'Molecular karyotype', 'U937']",2020/12/16 06:00,2020/12/16 06:01,['2020/12/15 05:40'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 05:40 [entrez]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-020-00517-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13039-020-00517-y [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2020 Dec 14;13(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s13039-020-00517-y.,,,"[""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St Vincent's Hospital, PO Box 2900, Fitzroy, Melbourne, 3065, Australia. ruth.mackinnon@svha.org.au."", ""Department of Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia. ruth.mackinnon@svha.org.au."", 'PathWest Department of Diagnostic Genomics, PathWest Laboratory Medicine, QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands, Australia.', ""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St Vincent's Hospital, PO Box 2900, Fitzroy, Melbourne, 3065, Australia."", ""Department of Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia."", 'Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Australia.""]",,,,,,PMC7737353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, large cohort studies on the clinical significance of HL in pediatric AML are paucity. Moreover, the effect of stem cell transplantation in HL patients remains unknown. METHODS: The clinical profiles of 885 pediatric patients with AML were downloaded from the TARGET dataset. HL was defined as an initial peripheral WBC count of >/= 100 x10(9)/L. We analyzed the prevalence, clinical profile and prognosis of HL in these patients. RESULTS: The frequency of HL among all the pediatric AML was 22.6%. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3/internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutation and gene fusion of NUP98/NSD1 occurred with higher incidence in HL patients. Overall, HL was associated with a low induction complete remission rate, and high risk of induction death. Moreover, HL predicted a significantly inferior 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (P < 0.001) and a trend of inferior 5-year overall survival (OS) (P = 0.059). However, compared with chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation had no significant effect on the survival of HL patients in terms of 5-year leukemia-free survival (P = 0.449) or OS (P = 0.447). Multivariate analysis revealed that HL was an independent prognosis factor for EFS (Hazard ratio:1.352, P = 0.013) but not for OS (Hazard ratio:1.225, P = 0.170) in pediatric AML. CONCLUSION: HL might predict inferior clinical outcome in pediatric AML. SCT is an effective therapy for AML, but it may have no better effect on the survival of patients with HL, compared to chemotherapy.","['Xu, Lu-Hong', 'Wang, Jing-Wen', 'Wang, Yin', 'Yang, Feng-Ying']","['Xu LH', 'Wang JW', 'Wang Y', 'Yang FY']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7898-7720'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical outcome', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'pediatric patients']",2020/12/16 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/12/15 05:39'],"['2020/12/15 05:39 [entrez]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1859169 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):507-514. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1859169.,20210204,,"[""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/epidemiology/*mortality/pathology', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/*blood/pathology', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Majority of reports revealed that RUNX1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. However, discrepancies still remain. The results of univariate analysis were not confirmed in multivariate analysis in some cases. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic effect of RUNX1 mutations in MDS. METHODS: We extracted data from qualified studies that were searched from PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the overall survival (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) were pooled from the multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Sixteen studies containing 5422 patients were included in this meta-analysis. There were 617 patients with mutated RUNX1 and 4805 patients with wide type RUNX1. The total HR for OS was 1.43 (95% CI = 1.21-1.70, P < 0.0001) and the counterpart of LFS was 1.88 (95% CI = 1.42-2.51, P < 0.0001).

Furthermore, poor prognosis of patients might be alleviated by stem cell transplantation.

Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) is characterized by tissue damage as a result of restriction and subsequent restoration of blood supply to an organ. Oxidative stress due to increased reactive oxygen species formation and/or insufficient antioxidant defense is considered to play an important role in I/R. Physical activity not only decreases the general risk factors for ischemia but also confers direct anti-ischemic protection via myokine production. Myokines are skeletal muscle-derived cytokines, representing multifunctional communication channels between the contracting skeletal muscle and other organs through an endocrine manner. In this review, we discuss the most prominent members of the myokines (i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cathepsin B, decorin, fibroblast growth factors-2 and -21, follistatin, follistatin-like, insulin-like growth factor-1; interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-15, irisin, leukemia inhibitory factor, meteorin-like, myonectin, musclin, myostatin, and osteoglycin) with a particular interest in their potential influence on reactive oxygen and nitrogen species formation or antioxidant capacity. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of myokines and particularly their participation in the regulation of oxidative stress may widen their possible therapeutic use and, thereby, may support the fight against I/R.","['Szabo, Marton Richard', 'Pipicz, Marton', 'Csont, Tamas', 'Csonka, Csaba']","['Szabo MR', 'Pipicz M', 'Csont T', 'Csonka C']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0415-5192', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2532-6261']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201209,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['FGF', 'IGF', 'LIF', 'ROS', 'brain', 'cardioprotection', 'conditioning', 'exercise', 'myocardial', 'remote']",2020/12/16 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/12/15 01:05'],"['2020/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 01:05 [entrez]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21249382 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21249382 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 9;21(24). pii: ijms21249382. doi: 10.3390/ijms21249382.,20210302,,"['Metabolic Diseases and Cell Signaling (MEDICS) Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, University of Szeged, Dom ter 9, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence, University of Szeged, Dugonics ter 13, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Metabolic Diseases and Cell Signaling (MEDICS) Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, University of Szeged, Dom ter 9, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence, University of Szeged, Dugonics ter 13, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Metabolic Diseases and Cell Signaling (MEDICS) Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, University of Szeged, Dom ter 9, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence, University of Szeged, Dugonics ter 13, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Metabolic Diseases and Cell Signaling (MEDICS) Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, University of Szeged, Dom ter 9, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence, University of Szeged, Dugonics ter 13, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']","['Animals', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Reperfusion Injury/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,"['GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00040/National Research, Development and Innovation Office of', 'Hungary and the Ministry of Human Capacities', '20391 3/2018/FEKUSTRAT/National Research, Development and Innovation Office of', 'Hungary and the Ministry of Human Capacities', 'UNKP-19-3-SZTE-269/New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation', 'and Technology']",PMC7763329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe an approach for simultaneous multiparameter detection of p53, its post-translational modifications and p53 pathway-related signaling proteins in single cells using mass cytometry. METHOD: We conjugated p53-specific antibodies to metal tags for detection by mass cytometry, allowing the detection of proteins and their post-translational modifications in single cells. We provide an overview of the antibody validation process using relevant biological controls, including cell lines treated in vitro with a stimulus (irradiation) known to induce changes in the expression level of p53. Finally, we present the potential of the method through investigation of primary samples from leukemia patients with distinct TP53 mutational status. RESULTS: The p53 protein can be detected in cell lines and in primary samples by mass cytometry. By combining antibodies for p53-related signaling proteins with a surface marker panel, we show that mass cytometry can be used to decipher the single cell p53 signaling pathway in heterogeneous patient samples. CONCLUSION: Single cell profiling by mass cytometry allows the investigation of the p53 functionality through examination of relevant downstream signaling proteins in normal and malignant cells. Our work illustrates a novel approach for single cell profiling of p53.","['Fagerholt, Oda Helen Eck', 'Hellesoy, Monica', 'Gullaksen, Stein-Erik', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Fagerholt OHE', 'Hellesoy M', 'Gullaksen SE', 'Gjertsen BT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8512-9297', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9358-9704']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['antibodies', 'mass cytometry', 'p53']",2020/12/16 06:00,2020/12/16 06:01,['2020/12/15 01:05'],"['2020/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 01:05 [entrez]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/16 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123699 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123699 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 9;12(12). pii: cancers12123699. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123699.,,,"['Centre for Cancer Biomarkers (CCBIO), Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5007 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers (CCBIO), Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5007 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",,,,,"['239837/Bergens Forskningsstiftelse', '144345-2014/Kreftforeningen']",PMC7764694,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, factors like DNA damages, oxidative stress and inflammation would impair the stem cell functions, in addition to some metabolic and development patterns. At the cellular and tissulaire levels, this has consequences on growth, renewal and restoration which results into an impaired regeneration. This impaired homeostasis concerns also key metabolic tissues including muscles and liver which would worsen the energy balance outcome towards further development of obesity. Such impacts of obesity on regeneration shows the need of a specific care given to obese patients recovering from diseases or conditions requiring regeneration such as burns, radiotherapy and leukemia. On the other hand, since stem cells are suggested to manage obesity, this impaired regeneration homeostasis needs to be considered towards more optimized stem cells-based obesity therapies within the context of precision medicine.","['Ghanemi, Abdelaziz', 'Yoshioka, Mayumi', 'St-Amand, Jonny']","['Ghanemi A', 'Yoshioka M', 'St-Amand J']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9676-1119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2595-6127']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,Switzerland,Animals (Basel),Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,101635614,,['NOTNLM'],"['homeostasis', 'obesity', 'regeneration']",2020/12/16 06:00,2020/12/16 06:01,['2020/12/15 01:04'],"['2020/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/16 06:01 [medline]']","['ani10122344 [pii]', '10.3390/ani10122344 [doi]']",epublish,Animals (Basel). 2020 Dec 9;10(12). pii: ani10122344. doi: 10.3390/ani10122344.,,,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Functional Genomics Laboratory, Endocrinology and Nephrology Axis, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Functional Genomics Laboratory, Endocrinology and Nephrology Axis, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Functional Genomics Laboratory, Endocrinology and Nephrology Axis, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.']",,,,,,PMC7763812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematological malignancies, tumor-derived EVs are critical players in mediating intercellular communications through the transfer of genetic materials and proteins between neoplastic cells themselves and to several components of the bone marrow microenvironment, rendering the latter a ""stronger"" niche supporting cancer cell proliferation, drug resistance, and escape from immune surveillance. In this context, the molecular cargoes of tumor-derived EVs reflect the nature and status of the cells of origin, making them specific therapeutic targets. Another important characteristic of EVs in hematological malignancies is their use as a potential ""liquid biopsy"" because of their high abundance in biofluids and their ability to protect their molecular cargoes from nuclease and protease degradation. Liquid biopsies are non-invasive blood tests that provide a molecular profiling clinical tool as an alternative method of disease stratification, especially in cancer patients where solid biopsies have limited accessibility. They offer accurate diagnoses and identify specific biomarkers for monitoring of disease progression and response to treatment. In this review, we will focus on the role of EVs in the most prevalent hematological malignancies, particularly on their prospective use as biomarkers in the context of liquid biopsies, as well as their molecular signature that identifies them as specific therapeutic targets for inhibiting cancer progression. We will also highlight their roles in modulating the immune response by acting as both immunosuppressors and activators of anti-tumor immunity.","['Khalife, Jihane', 'Sanchez, James F', 'Pichiorri, Flavia']","['Khalife J', 'Sanchez JF', 'Pichiorri F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201209,Switzerland,Diagnostics (Basel),"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",101658402,,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarkers', 'exosomes', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'multiple myeloma']",2020/12/16 06:00,2020/12/16 06:01,['2020/12/15 01:04'],"['2020/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/16 06:01 [medline]']","['diagnostics10121065 [pii]', '10.3390/diagnostics10121065 [doi]']",epublish,Diagnostics (Basel). 2020 Dec 9;10(12). pii: diagnostics10121065. doi: 10.3390/diagnostics10121065.,,,"['Judy and Bernard Briskin Center for Multiple Myeloma Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Judy and Bernard Briskin Center for Multiple Myeloma Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Judy and Bernard Briskin Center for Multiple Myeloma Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",,,,,,PMC7763630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the patient with CBF-AML is in complete morphologic remission but MRD positive at the end of treatment, what to do for those is still uncertain. Preemptive intervention approaches such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or intensive chemotherapy could be an option or another strategy might be just follow-up until overt relapse developed.

However, some patients, especially those with high tumour burden, develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS). It is likely that more patients will develop therapy-linked CRS in the future due to the implementation of other immunotherapies, such as CAR T-cell, for many malignancies. Current methods for CRS risk assessment are limited, hence there is a need to develop new methods. To better recapitulate an in vivo setting, we implemented a unique human whole blood ""loop"" system to study patient-specific immune responses to rituximab in blood derived from CLL patients. Upon rituximab infusion, both complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) profiles were evident in CLL patient blood, coincident with CLL cell depletion. Whereas B cell depletion is induced in healthy persons in the blood loop, only patients display B cell depletion coupled with CRS. With the exception of one donor who lacked NK cells, all other five patients displayed variable B cell depletion along with CRS profile. Additionally, inhibition of CDC or ADCC via either inhibitors or antibody Fc modification resulted in skewing of the immune killing mechanism consistent with published literature. Herein we have shown that the human whole blood loop model can be applied using blood from a specific indication to build a disease-specific CRS and immune activation profiling ex vivo system. Other therapeutic antibodies used for other indications may benefit from antibody characterization in a similar setting.","['Eltahir, M', 'Fletcher, E', 'Dynesius, L', 'Jarblad, J L', 'Lord, M', 'Lauren, I', 'Zekarias, M', 'Yu, X', 'Cragg, M S', 'Hammarstrom, C', 'Levedahl, K H', 'Hoglund, M', 'Ullenhag, G', 'Mattsson, M', 'Mangsbo, S M']","['Eltahir M', 'Fletcher E', 'Dynesius L', 'Jarblad JL', 'Lord M', 'Lauren I', 'Zekarias M', 'Yu X', 'Cragg MS', 'Hammarstrom C', 'Levedahl KH', 'Hoglund M', 'Ullenhag G', 'Mattsson M', 'Mangsbo SM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201211,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-CD20 antibodies', 'Antibody immunotherapy', 'CLL patients', 'CRS', 'Cytokine release syndrome', 'Rituximab', 'Whole blood loop assay']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/12/14 20:14'],"['2020/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 20:14 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(20)33693-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107226 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2021 Jan;90:107226. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107226.

Review of its behavior detailed in 585 published cases should lead to better treatment. Leukemic tumors were found up to 13 years after transplant, most in sites inaccessible to physical exam. In 83%, marrow was not in morphologic relapse; next relapse was most often extramedullary. Induction protocols alone produced few durable responses in acute leukemias and fatal marrow aplasia in 17 %. Overall, 120 patients survived over 2 years, 43 relapse-free up to 18 years, the majority after combined tumor-directed and systemic therapy. Overall median survival was 9 months. This review highlights how results can improve: by defining extent of leukemia involvement with scans before transplant, and emergently when leukemic tumor is found after, ablating tumor directly to abort metastasis, and determining dosing of systemic chemotherapy that protects, without ablating, donor marrow. Monitoring total body remission with body scans should increase transplant cures.","['Cunningham, Isabel']",['Cunningham I'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201126,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemoresistance', 'Extramedullary', 'Leukemia', 'Metastasis', 'PET/CT', 'Relapse', 'Transplant']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/12/14 20:12'],"['2020/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 20:12 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(20)30306-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.103170 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2021 Jan;157:103170. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.103170.

However, transformation into an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, called Richter syndrome (RS), remains highly challenging since the treatment options for this condition are still insufficient. Exploratory drug testing and experimental studies are restricted by the lack of satisfactory models. We have established U-RT1, a cell line derived from a highly proliferating RS clonally related to the patient's underlying CLL. The cell line shows morphological features and an immunophenotype of RS-DLBCL (non-GCB). Molecular analysis revealed a complex karyotype with driver aberrations characteristic for RS such as loss of TP53 and CDKN2A. Furthermore, U-RT1 displays a chromosomal gain of the NOTCH1 gene locus and strong immunoreactivity for BCL-2. These features suggest that U-RT1 is the first eligible model system for investigations on the pathogenesis of RS and novel treatment options.","['Schmid, Teresa', 'Maier, Julia', 'Martin, Melanie', 'Tasdogan, Alpaslan', 'Tausch, Eugen', 'Barth, Thomas F E', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Bloehdorn, Johannes', 'Moller, Peter', 'Mellert, Kevin']","['Schmid T', 'Maier J', 'Martin M', 'Tasdogan A', 'Tausch E', 'Barth TFE', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Bloehdorn J', 'Moller P', 'Mellert K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201211,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*DLBCL', '*In vitro model', '*Richter syndrome', '*Richter transformation']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2020/12/14 20:10'],"['2020/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 20:10 [entrez]']","['S1476-5586(20)30178-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neo.2020.11.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Neoplasia. 2021 Jan;23(1):140-148. doi: 10.1016/j.neo.2020.11.010.

There are limited publications on the ethnic and racial disparity of cytogenetics and genomics in CMML patients. This study aims to define the cytogenetic and molecular landscape in Hispanic CMML patients from Puerto Rico and explore its possible clinical significance. One hundred and eleven (111) Hispanic CMML patients from Puerto Rico were diagnosed in our institute from 2009 to 2018. Karyotypes were available in one hundred and seven (107) patients. Seventeen (17) patients had abnormal karyotypes (17/107, 16%). Compared to previously published data, Hispanic CMML patients in this study had significantly lower rates of overall cytogenetic abnormalities (16% vs 27-28%, p < 0.05) and trisomy 8 (2% vs 7%, p < 0.05). Among one hundred and eleven (111) Hispanic CMML patients, 40-gene myeloid molecular profile tests were performed in fifty-six (56) CMML patients. Gene mutations were identified in fifty-four (54) patients (96%). The most frequent mutated genes were: TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, ZRSR2, DNMT3A, NRAS, CBL, and RUNX1. Twenty-nine (29) out of fifty-six (56) patients (29/56, 52%) had mutated TET2/wild type ASXL1 (muTET2/wtASXL1). Previous studies indicated that mutated ASXL1, DNMT3A, NRAS, RUNX1, and SETBP1 may associate with an unfavorable prognosis and muTET2/wtASXL1 may associate with a favorable prognosis in CMML patients. Compared to previously published data, Hispanic CMML patients from Puerto Rico in this study had significantly lower mutation rates in ASXL1 and SETBP1, and a higher rate of muTET2/wtASXL1. The findings raise the possibility of a favorable prognosis in Hispanic CMML patients.","['Jiang, Zeju', 'Sun, Xinlai', 'Wu, Zhao', 'Alhatem, Albert', 'Zheng, Ruifang', 'Liu, Dongfang', 'Wang, Yaqun', 'Kumar, Dibyendu', 'Xia, Changqing', 'You, Bei', 'Wang, He', 'Liu, Chen', 'Jiang, Jie-Gen']","['Jiang Z', 'Sun X', 'Wu Z', 'Alhatem A', 'Zheng R', 'Liu D', 'Wang Y', 'Kumar D', 'Xia C', 'You B', 'Wang H', 'Liu C', 'Jiang JG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201124,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hispanic', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'cytogenetic abnormality', 'gene mutation']",2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:01,['2020/12/14 17:14'],"['2020/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 17:14 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27824 [doi]', '27824 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Nov 24;11(47):4411-4420. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27824. eCollection 2020 Nov 24.,,['Copyright: (c) 2020 Jiang et al.'],"['Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Jiangxi Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Neogenomics, Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Rutgers School of Public Health and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.', 'Institute of Genomics Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Institute of Genomics Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Institute of Genomics Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,PMC7720771,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In yeast, Dot1 is required for telomeric silencing and genomic integrity. In Drosophila, Dot1 (Grappa) regulates homoeotic gene expression. Dysregulation of DOT1L (human homologue of Dot1) causes leukaemia and is implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy. In mice, germline disruption of Dot1L and loss of H3K79me2 disrupt vascular and haematopoietic development. Targeted inactivation of Dot1L in principal cells of the mature collecting duct affects terminal differentiation and cell type patterning. However, the role of H3K79 methylation in mammalian tissue development has been questioned, as it is dispensable in the intestinal epithelium, a rapidly proliferating tissue. Here, we used lineage-specific Cre recombinase to delineate the role of Dot1L methyltransferase activity in the mouse metanephric kidney, an organ that develops via interactions between ureteric epithelial (Hoxb7) and mesenchymal (Six2) cell lineages. The results demonstrate that Dot1L(Hoxb7) is dispensable for ureteric bud branching morphogenesis. In contrast, Dot1L(Six2) is critical for the maintenance and differentiation of Six2+ progenitors into epithelial nephrons. Dot1LSix2 mutant kidneys exhibit congenital nephron deficit and cystic dysplastic kidney disease. Molecular analysis implicates defects in key renal developmental regulators, such as Lhx1, Pax2 and Notch. We conclude that the developmental functions of Dot1L-H3K79 methylation in the kidney are lineage-restricted. The link between H3K79me and renal developmental pathways reaffirms the importance of chromatin-based mechanisms in organogenesis.","['Wang, Fenglin', 'Ngo, Jenny', 'Li, Yuwen', 'Liu, Hongbing', 'Chen, Chao-Hui', 'Saifudeen, Zubaida', 'Sequeira-Lopez, Maria Luisa S', 'El-Dahr, Samir S']","['Wang F', 'Ngo J', 'Li Y', 'Liu H', 'Chen CH', 'Saifudeen Z', 'Sequeira-Lopez MLS', 'El-Dahr SS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4459-7940', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7571-4292']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20201229,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Dot1L', '*Epigenetic', '*Kidney', '*Mouse', '*nephrogenesis']",2020/12/15 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2020/12/14 17:12'],"['2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15592294.2020.1861168 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2021 Nov;16(11):1235-1250. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2020.1861168.

However, these therapies can be complicated and expensive to deliver due to their sensitivity to environment; troublesome tissue, cell, or genetic material sourcing; and complicated regulatory requirements. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create a novel connected supply chain logistics and manufacturing management platform based on blockchain, with cell and gene therapy as a use case. Objectives are to define the requirements and perform feasibility evaluations on the use of blockchain for standardized manufacturing and establishment of a chain of custody for the needle-to-needle delivery of autologous cell and gene therapies. A way of lowering overall regulatory compliance costs for running a network of facilities operating similar or parallel processes will be evaluated by lowering the monitoring costs through publishing zero-knowledge proofs and product release by exception. METHODS: The study will use blockchain technologies to digitally connect and integrate supply chain with manufacturing to address the security, scheduling, and communication issues between advanced therapy treatment centers and manufacturing facilities in order to realize a transparent, secure, automated, and cost-effective solution to the delivery of these life-saving therapies. An agile software development methodology will be used to develop, implement, and evaluate the system. The system will adhere to the EU and US good manufacturing practices and regulatory requirements. RESULTS: This is a proposed study protocol, and upon acceptance, grant funding will be pursued for its execution in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The successful implementation of the integrated blockchain solution to supply chain and manufacturing of advanced therapies can push the industry standards toward a safer and more secure therapy delivery process.

However, the expression level of U2AF1 gene and its prognostic significance are unclear in pediatric ALL patients. The study aimed to study the mRNA level of U2AF1 in pediatric ALL patients and its clinical relevance with long-term survival. METHODS: We quantitatively determined U2AF1 gene expression at diagnosis in 132 children with ALL by real-time PCR. According to the patients' median U2AF1 value, the patients' samples were classified into low U2AF1 and high U2AF1 expression groups. Twenty-two bone marrow samples from 22 patients with ITP were recruited as control. The correlation between the expression level of U2AF1 and clinical treatment outcome was analyzed. RESULTS: Pediatric patients with ALL showed higher U2AF1 mRNA levels than controls (P = .034). The relapse rates of patients in low U2AF1 levels group were obviously higher than those of U2AF1 high expression group (28.8% vs 12.1%, P = .030). Patients of low U2AF1 expression presented worse 5-year EFS than those of high U2AF1 expression (60% vs 81%, P = .035). For T-ALL, patients with low U2AF1 mRNA level showed lower BM blast percentages (P = .031), worse EFS (37.8% vs 92.3%, P = .003), and CIR (62.2% vs 7.7%, P = .003) than those in high U2AF1 expression group. Multivariate analysis confirmed low U2AF1 mRNA level could be used as an independent risk indicator of poor EFS and CIR of children with T-ALL. CONCLUSION: Low U2AF1 mRNA level is related to inferior prognosis and can be served as a prognostic indicator for risk stratification in children with T-ALL.","['Zhang, Ping', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Li, Xiaoxiao', 'Ying, Peiting', 'Tang, Yongmin']","['Zhang P', 'Zhang Y', 'Li X', 'Ying P', 'Tang Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1409-5517'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20201213,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['U2AF1', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'expression', 'pediatric', 'prognosis']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:18'],"['2020/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13433 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Aug;43(4):675-682. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13433.

However, strategies targeting Notch1 signaling render only modest results in the clinic due to treatment resistance and severe side effects. While many investigations reported the different aspects of tumor cell growth and leukemia progression controlled by Notch1, less is known regarding the modifications of cellular metabolism induced by Notch1 upregulation in T-ALL. Previously, glutaminolysis inhibition has been proposed to synergize with anti-Notch therapies in T-ALL models. In this work, we report that Notch1 upregulation in T-ALL induced a change in the metabolism of the important amino acid glutamine, preventing glutamine synthesis through the downregulation of glutamine synthetase (GS). Downregulation of GS was responsible for glutamine addiction in Notch1-driven T-ALL both in vitro and in vivo. Our results also confirmed an increase in glutaminolysis mediated by Notch1. Increased glutaminolysis resulted in the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, a central controller of cell growth. However, glutaminolysis did not play any role in Notch1-induced glutamine addiction. Finally, the combined treatment targeting mTORC1 and limiting glutamine availability had a synergistic effect to induce apoptosis and to prevent Notch1-driven leukemia progression. Our results placed glutamine limitation and mTORC1 inhibition as a potential therapy against Notch1-driven leukemia.","['Nguyen, Tra Ly', 'Nokin, Marie-Julie', 'Teres, Silvia', 'Tome, Mercedes', 'Bodineau, Clement', 'Galmar, Oriane', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Rousseau, Benoit', 'van Liempd, Sebastian', 'Falcon-Perez, Juan Manuel', 'Richard, Elodie', 'Muzotte, Elodie', 'Rezvani, Hamid-Reza', 'Priault, Muriel', 'Bouchecareilh, Marion', 'Redonnet-Vernhet, Isabelle', 'Calvo, Julien', 'Uzan, Benjamin', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Fuentes, Patricia', 'Toribio, Maria L', 'Khatib, Abdel-Majid', 'Soubeyran, Pierre', 'Murdoch, Piedad Del Socorro', 'Duran, Raul V']","['Nguyen TL', 'Nokin MJ', 'Teres S', 'Tome M', 'Bodineau C', 'Galmar O', 'Pasquet JM', 'Rousseau B', 'van Liempd S', 'Falcon-Perez JM', 'Richard E', 'Muzotte E', 'Rezvani HR', 'Priault M', 'Bouchecareilh M', 'Redonnet-Vernhet I', 'Calvo J', 'Uzan B', 'Pflumio F', 'Fuentes P', 'Toribio ML', 'Khatib AM', 'Soubeyran P', 'Murdoch PDS', 'Duran RV']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2249-9215'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210213,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch1', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*glutamine', '*glutamine synthetase', '*mTORC1', '*metabolic addiction']",2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:18'],"['2020/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:18 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12877 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2021 May;15(5):1412-1431. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12877.

CLL has a well-defined immunophenotype, yet, some cases of CLL demonstrate atypical morphology/ phenotype reflected by low Matutes score (atypical CLL). Till date, LEF1 expression has not been systematically studied in cases of CLL with atypical features. METHODS: In this study, LEF-1 expression was assessed by two different techniques, (immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry), to investigate the expression profile of LEF-1 in cases of CLL/SLL, in comparison with other low-grade B-lymphomas and CLL with atypical features, including atypical immunophenotype and CLL with increased prolymphocytes or morphologically atypical cells. RESULTS: We found that LEF-1 expression is downregulated in CLL with atypical immunophenotype/features compared to classic CLL; Chi-Square P < .0001. The ratio for LEF-1 expression in malignant B-cells/NK (by flow cytometry) in CLL/SLL with classic immunophenotype was higher than atypical CLL and is significantly higher in other small B-cell lymphomas (P < .01). Absence of LEF-1 expression in CLL/SLL is correlated (P < .05) with downregulation of CD5, CD23, CD200, expression of FMC7, brighter expression of CD79b, brighter expression of surface light chain, increased prolymphocytes and lower Matutes score. CONCLUSION: As downregulation of LEF-1 expression is well correlated with atypical CLL, we suggest adding LEF-1 to Matutes score as a beneficial marker to differentiate classic from atypical CLL LEF-1 could also serve as a potential prognostic indicator for CLL clinical course.","['Soliman, Dina S', 'Al-Kuwari, Einas', 'Siveen, Kodappully S', 'Al-Abdulla, Rajaa', 'Chandra, Prem', 'Yassin, Mohamed', 'Nashwan, Abdulqader', 'Hilmi, Feryal A', 'Taha, Ruba Y', 'Nawaz, Zafar', 'El-Omri, Halima', 'Mateo, Jericha M', 'Al-Sabbagh, Ahmad']","['Soliman DS', 'Al-Kuwari E', 'Siveen KS', 'Al-Abdulla R', 'Chandra P', 'Yassin M', 'Nashwan A', 'Hilmi FA', 'Taha RY', 'Nawaz Z', 'El-Omri H', 'Mateo JM', 'Al-Sabbagh A']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0624-3973'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201212,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)', 'Flow cytometry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1)', 'atypical CLL']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:16'],"['2020/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:16 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13420 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Jun;43(3):515-525. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13420.

We describe a COVID-19 outbreak on our leukemia and stem cell transplantation unit (LSCT-Unit) originating from a patient with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was treated with intensive induction chemotherapy and we characterize the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 on a LSCT-Unit. We describe the characteristics of the 36 contacts among the medical team, the results of their PCR and antibody tests and clinical aspects and features of infected employees. Of these 36 close contacts, 9 employees of the LSCT-Unit were infected and were tested positive by PCR and/or antibody-testing. 8/9 of them were symptomatic, 3/9 with severe, 5/9 with mild symptoms, and one person without symptoms. Due to stringent hygiene measures, the outbreak did not lead to infections of other patients despite ongoing clinical work. Moreover, we demonstrate that incubation period and clinical course of a COVID-19 infection in an immunosuppressed patient could be unusual compared to that of immunocompetent patients. Consistent PCR and antibody testing are helpful to understand, control, and prevent outbreaks. For the safety of health-care workers and patients alike, all employees wore FFP2 masks and were trained to adhere to several further safety guidelines. The implementation of rigorous hygiene measures is the key to controlling an outbreak and preventing infections of other patients.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Gotz, Marlies', 'Malner-Wagner, Waltraud', 'Wendt, Constanze', 'Enders, Martin', 'Durst, Christine', 'Michel, Detlef', 'von Harsdorf, S', 'Jung, Susanne']","['Greiner J', 'Gotz M', 'Malner-Wagner W', 'Wendt C', 'Enders M', 'Durst C', 'Michel D', 'von Harsdorf S', 'Jung S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1256-173X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201212,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19 infection', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*health-care facilities', '*immunocompromised individuals', '*management of disease control']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:15'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:15 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3612 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2021 Jan;10(1):237-246. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3612.

In this study, seventeen thiosemicarbazone-containing compounds were prepared and evaluated as potential antileukemia agents against drug resistant K562/A02 cell overexpressing P-gp. Among them, N-hydroxy-6-({(2E)-2-[(3-nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexan amide could significantly inhibit K562/A02 cells proliferation with an IC50 value of 0.96 muM. Interestingly, N-hydroxy-6-({(2E)-2-[(3-nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexan amide could dose-dependently increase ROS levels of drug resistant K562/A02 cells, thus displaying a potential collateral sensitivity (CS)-inducing effect and selectively killing K562/A02 cells. Furthermore, N-hydroxy-6-({(2E)-2-[(3-nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexan amide possessed potent inhibitory effect on HDAC1 and HDAC6, and could promote K562/A02 cells apoptosis via dose-dependently increasing Bax expression, reducing Bcl-2 protein level, and inducing the cleavage of PARP and caspase3. These present findings suggest that N-hydroxy-6-({(2E)-2-[(3-nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexan amide might be a promising lead to discover novel antileukemia agents against P-gp overexpressing leukemic cells.","['Gu, Xiaoke', 'Guan, Mingyu', 'Jiang, Chunyu', 'Song, Qinghua', 'Li, Xin', 'Sun, Nan', 'Chen, Jing', 'Qiu, Jingying']","['Gu X', 'Guan M', 'Jiang C', 'Song Q', 'Li X', 'Sun N', 'Chen J', 'Qiu J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210112,Switzerland,Chem Biodivers,Chemistry & biodiversity,101197449,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['P-gp', 'collateral sensitivity', 'multidrug resistance', 'thiosemicarbazones']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:15'],"['2020/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:15 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbdv.202000775 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biodivers. 2021 Feb;18(2):e2000775. doi: 10.1002/cbdv.202000775.

Antibody-based agents targeting CD22 or CD20 on B lymphoma and leukemia cells exhibit clinical efficacy for treating these malignancies, but also attack normal B cells leading to immune deficiency. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to introduce high-affinity and specific CD22 ligands onto NK-92MI and cytokine-induced natural killer cells to achieve tumor-specific CD22 targeting. These CD22-ligand modified cells exhibited significantly enhanced tumor cell binding and killing in vitro without harming healthy B cells. For effective lymphoma cell killing in vivo, we further functionalized CD22 ligand-modified NK-92MI cells with the E-selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X to promote trafficking to bone marrow. The dual-functionalized cells resulted in the efficient suppression of B lymphoma in a xenograft model. Our results suggest that natural killer cells modified with glycan ligands to CD22 and selectins promote both targeted killing of B lymphoma cells and improved trafficking to sites where the cancer cells reside, respectively.","['Hong, Senlian', 'Yu, Chenhua', 'Wang, Peng', 'Shi, Yujie', 'Cao, Weiqian', 'Cheng, Bo', 'Chapla, Digantkumar G', 'Ma, Yuanhui', 'Li, Jie', 'Rodrigues, Emily', 'Narimatsu, Yoshiki', 'Yates, John R 3rd', 'Chen, Xing', 'Clausen, Henrik', 'Moremen, Kelly W', 'Macauley, Matthew Scott', 'Paulson, James C', 'Wu, Peng']","['Hong S', 'Yu C', 'Wang P', 'Shi Y', 'Cao W', 'Cheng B', 'Chapla DG', 'Ma Y', 'Li J', 'Rodrigues E', 'Narimatsu Y', 'Yates JR 3rd', 'Chen X', 'Clausen H', 'Moremen KW', 'Macauley MS', 'Paulson JC', 'Wu P']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4058-7980', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4579-1048', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5204-0229']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201214,Germany,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),0370543,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-lymphoma', '*CD22 ligands', '*E-selectin', '*chemoenzymatic glycan editing', '*sLeX']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/03/23 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:15'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2022/02/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:15 [entrez]']",['10.1002/anie.202005934 [doi]'],ppublish,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2021 Feb 15;60(7):3603-3610. doi: 10.1002/anie.202005934.

With the interventions of Tocilizumab and steroids, many patients can recover from severe CRS. However, some patients are refractory to steroids and develop life-threatening consequences. Ruxolitinib is an oral JAKs inhibitor and promising drug in inflammatory diseases. In this pilot study, we evaluate the efficacy of Ruxolitinib in CRS. Of 14 r/r B-ALL children who received CD19 or CD22 CAR T cell therapies, 4 patients developed severe (>/=grade 3) CRS with symptoms that were not alleviated with high-dose steroids and thus received ruxolitinib. Rapid resolution of CRS symptoms was observed in 4 patients after ruxolitinib treatment. Serum cytokines significantly decreased after ruxolitinib intervention. All patients achieved complete remission on day 30 after infusion, and we could still detect CAR T expansion in vivo despite usage of ruxolitinib. There were no obvious adverse events related to ruxolitinib. In vitro assays revealed that ruxolitinib could dampen CAR T expansion and cytotoxicity, suggesting that the timing and dosage of ruxolitinib should be carefully considered to avoid dampening anti-leukaemia response. Our results suggest that ruxolitinib is active and well tolerated in steroid-refractory and even life-threatening CRS.","['Pan, Jing', 'Deng, Biping', 'Ling, Zhuojun', 'Song, Weiliang', 'Xu, Jinlong', 'Duan, Jiajia', 'Wang, Zelin', 'Chang, Alex H', 'Feng, Xiaoming', 'Tan, Yue']","['Pan J', 'Deng B', 'Ling Z', 'Song W', 'Xu J', 'Duan J', 'Wang Z', 'Chang AH', 'Feng X', 'Tan Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8785-0336'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201212,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cell therapy', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*hematology', '*immunology', '*ruxolitinib']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/09/15 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:14'],"['2020/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.16176 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2021 Jan;25(2):1089-1099. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.16176.

Dosing is routinely adjusted for body surface area (BSA), but limited data describe the pharmacokinetics of HDMTX, particularly in obese and/or large patients. To understand the impact of body size (BSA) and body fat percentage (BFP) on HDMTX pharmacokinetics, we performed a secondary analysis of 36 children and adolescents 10-21 years old treated for newly diagnosed ALL and who were enrolled in a prospective study examining body composition. All patients received 5 g/m(2) of HDMTX infused over 24 hours. Plasma methotrexate concentrations were measured at 24, 42, and 48 hours. At 48 hours, >/=0.4 mumol/L was defined as ""delayed elimination,"" necessitating prolonged supportive care. BFP was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. A nonparametric population pharmacokinetic model was constructed with subsequent simulations to explore effects of BSA and BFP extremes. Despite standard BSA-adjusted dosing, we found significant intrapatient variability in mean MTX concentration (38%; range, 1.2%-86%). BSA and BFP were not linearly associated with increased area under the curve (AUC, P = 0.74 and P = 0.12), but both larger size (BSA) and greater obesity (BFP) were associated with an approximately 2-fold higher risk for delayed elimination at 48 hours. HDMTX AUC was not associated with toxicity. MTX pharmacokinetics vary among and even within patients despite BSA-adjusted dosing. Obesity and large size are identified as new risk factors for delayed elimination, requiring further investigation.","['Orgel, Etan', 'Nabais, Teresa', 'Douglas, Christopher', 'Mittelman, Steven D', 'Neely, Michael']","['Orgel E', 'Nabais T', 'Douglas C', 'Mittelman SD', 'Neely M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1487-6818', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9678-3262']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210113,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*methotrexate', '*obesity', '*pharmacokinetics']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:07'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:07 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.1799 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2021 Jun;61(6):755-762. doi: 10.1002/jcph.1799.

To further characterise this aberration, we studied 57 cases; the largest series reported to date. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis confirmed the involvement of CDK6 in all cases, including t(2;7)(p11;q21) immunoglobulin kappa locus (IGK)/CDK6 (n = 51), t(7;14)(q21;q32) CDK6/immunoglobulin heavy locus (IGH) (n = 2) and the previously undescribed t(7;14)(q21;q11) CDK6/T-cell receptor alpha locus (TRA)/T-cell receptor delta locus (TRD) (n = 4). In total, 10 patients were diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis or small lymphocytic lymphoma, and 47 had small B-cell lymphoma (SmBL) including 36 cases of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL; 34 splenic MZLs, one nodal MZL and one bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma). In all, 18 of the 26 cytologically reviewed cases of MZL (69%) had an atypical aspect with prolymphocytic cells. Among the 47 patients with MZL/SmBL, CD5 expression was found in 26 (55%) and the tumour protein p53 (TP53) deletion in 22 (47%). The TP53 gene was mutated in 10/30 (33%); the 7q deletion was detected in only one case, and no Notch receptor 2 (NOTCH2) mutations were found. Immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGHV) locus sequencing revealed that none harboured an IGHV1-02*04 gene. Overall survival was 82% at 10 years and not influenced by TP53 aberration. Our present findings suggest that most t(CDK6)+ neoplasms correspond to a particular subgroup of indolent marginal zone B-cell lymphomas with distinctive features.","['Gailllard, Baptiste', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Le, Quoc-Hung', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Pannetier, Melanie', 'Lecoq-Lafon, Carinne', 'Grange, Beatrice', 'Jondreville, Ludovic', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Nadal, Nathalie', 'Ittel, Antoine', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Lefebvre, Christine', 'Gaillard, Jean-Baptiste', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Balducci, Estelle', 'Penther, Dominique', 'Barin, Carole', 'Collonge-Rame, Marie Agnes', 'Jimenez-Poquet, Melanie', 'Richebourg, Steven', 'Lemaire, Pierre', 'Defasque, Sabine', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Bidet, Audrey', 'Susin, Santos A', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Chapiro, Elise']","['Gailllard B', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Le QH', 'Maloum K', 'Pannetier M', 'Lecoq-Lafon C', 'Grange B', 'Jondreville L', 'Michaux L', 'Nadal N', 'Ittel A', 'Luquet I', 'Struski S', 'Lefebvre C', 'Gaillard JB', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Balducci E', 'Penther D', 'Barin C', 'Collonge-Rame MA', 'Jimenez-Poquet M', 'Richebourg S', 'Lemaire P', 'Defasque S', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Bidet A', 'Susin SA', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Chapiro E']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3427-7596'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201213,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD5', '*CDK6', '*TP53', '*marginal zone lymphoma', '*prolymphocytic cell']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:04'],"['2020/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:04 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17141 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Apr;193(1):72-82. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17141.

In previous studies, our 3D models on a decellularized tissue matrix have shown better predictivity and higher chemoresistance. A single porcine intestine yields material for 150 3D models of breast, lung, colorectal cancer (CRC) or leukemia. The uniquely preserved structure of the basement membrane enables physiological anchorage of endothelial cells and epithelial-derived carcinoma cells. The matrix provides different niches for cell growth: on top as monolayer, in crypts as aggregates, and within deeper layers. Dynamic culture in bioreactors enhances cell growth. Comparing gene expression between 2D and 3D cultures, we observed changes related to proliferation, apoptosis and stemness. For drug target predictions, we utilize tumor-specific sequencing data in our in silico model, finding an additive effect of metformin and gefitinib treatment for lung cancer in silico, validated in vitro. To analyze mode-of-action, immune therapies such as trispecific T-cell engagers in leukemia or toxicity on non-cancer cells, the model can be modularly enriched with human endothelial cells (hECs), immune cells and fibroblasts. Upon addition of hECs, transmigration of immune cells through the endothelial barrier can be investigated. In an allogenic CRC model, we observe a lower basic apoptosis rate after applying PBMCs in 3D compared to 2D, which offers new options to mirror antigen-specific immunotherapies in vitro. In conclusion, we present modular human 3D tumor models with tissue-like features for preclinical testing to reduce animal experiments.","['Kuhnemundt, Johanna', 'Leifeld, Heidi', 'Scherg, Florian', 'Schmitt, Matthias', 'Nelke, Lena C', 'Schmitt, Tina', 'Baur, Florentin', 'Gottlich, Claudia', 'Fuchs, Maximilian', 'Kunz, Meik', 'Peindl, Matthias', 'Brahler, Caroline', 'Kronenthaler, Corinna', 'Wischhusen, Jorg', 'Prelog, Martina', 'Walles, Heike', 'Dandekar, Thomas', 'Dandekar, Gudrun', 'Nietzer, Sarah L']","['Kuhnemundt J', 'Leifeld H', 'Scherg F', 'Schmitt M', 'Nelke LC', 'Schmitt T', 'Baur F', 'Gottlich C', 'Fuchs M', 'Kunz M', 'Peindl M', 'Brahler C', 'Kronenthaler C', 'Wischhusen J', 'Prelog M', 'Walles H', 'Dandekar T', 'Dandekar G', 'Nietzer SL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201211,Germany,ALTEX,ALTEX,100953980,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['* bioreactor culture', '* combinatorial drug predictions', '* immunotherapies modeling', '* invasiveness', '*modular tumor tissue models']",2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:04'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 11:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14573/altex.2008141 [doi]'],aheadofprint,ALTEX. 2020 Dec 11;38(2):289-306. doi: 10.14573/altex.2008141.,,,"['Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Translational Center Regenerative Therapies, Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Translational Center Regenerative Therapies, Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics, Biocenter, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics, Biocenter, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'University Hospital Wurzburg, Department for Obstetrics & Gynecology, Section for Experimental Tumor Immunology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', ""Children's University Hospital, Pediatric Rheumatology/Special Immunology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany."", 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Translational Center Regenerative Therapies, Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'FVST, Core Facility Tissue Engineering, Otto-von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics, Biocenter, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Translational Center Regenerative Therapies, Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Translational Center Regenerative Therapies, Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, Wurzburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of shikonin on lipoteichoic acid (LTA)induced acute lung injury (ALI) remains to be elucidated. ALI is a serious illness resulting from significant pulmonary inflammation caused by various diseases, such as sepsis, acid aspiration and trauma. The present study found that shikonin significantly attenuated LTAinduced ALI. Following shikonin treatment, the accumulation of pulmonary neutrophils and expression of TNFalpha, IL1beta and IL6 were decreased in mice with LTAinduced ALI. Furthermore, Shikonin promoted neutrophil apoptosis by increasing the activation of caspase3 and reducing the expression of the antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia1 (Mcl1) protein. However, shikonin treatment did not influence the expression of Bcell lymphoma2. The findings of the present study demonstrated that shikonin protected against LTAinduced ALI by promoting caspase-3 and Mcl1related neutrophil apoptosis, suggesting that shikonin is a potential agent that can be used in the treatment of sepsismediated lung injury.","['Zhang, Yong', 'Zhang, Haibo', 'Wang, Muqun', 'Gao, Shan', 'Hong, Lei', 'Hou, Tingting', 'Zhang, Yaoyao', 'Zhu, Yuling', 'Qian, Feng']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang H', 'Wang M', 'Gao S', 'Hong L', 'Hou T', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Qian F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201214,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*shikonin', '*lipoteichoic acid', '*acute lung injury', '*neutrophil', '*apoptosis', '*myeloid cell leukemia1']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:04'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 11:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2020.11772 [doi]', '133 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Feb;23(2). pii: 133. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2020.11772.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been suggested to serve as vital regulators in CRC. lncRNA feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1 antisense RNA 1 (FLVCR1AS1) is closely associated with the tumorigenesis of various types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA FLVCR1AS1 in CRC progression. The expression levels of FLVCR1AS1, microRNA (miR)381 and Rasrelated protein 2a (RAP2A) were measured by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). A KaplanMeier analysis was performed to determine the overall survival rate of patients with CRC. Furthermore, cell viability, migration and invasion were assessed using Cell Counting Kit8 (CCK8) and Transwell assays. The interaction between genes was confirmed using dualluciferase reporter and pulldown assays. The results demonstrated that FLVCR1AS1 was upregulated in CRC tissues and cells, and increased FLVCR1AS1 expression levels in patients with CRC were associated with poor prognosis. FLVCR1AS1 knockdown significantly attenuated the viability, migration and invasion ability of CRC cells. In addition, the results confirmed that FLVCR1AS1 directly binds with miR3813p, and that RAP2A is a direct target of miR3813p. The overexpression of FLVCR1AS1 increased RAP2A expression levels. Functional assays revealed that miR381 inhibitor or RAP2A overexpression attenuated the suppressive effects of FLVCR1AS1 silencing on CRC cell viability, migration and invasion. Overall, the findings of the current study suggest that FLVCR1AS1 promotes CRC progression via the miR381/RAP2A pathway. These findings may provide a novel approach for CRC treatment.","['Han, Yi', 'Wang, Xiaoyan', 'Mao, Enqiang', 'Shen, Boyong', 'Huang, Liang']","['Han Y', 'Wang X', 'Mao E', 'Shen B', 'Huang L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201214,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1 antisense RNA 1', '*miR381', '*colorectal cancer', '*Rasrelated protein 2a']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:04'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 11:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2020.11778 [doi]', '139 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Feb;23(2). pii: 139. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2020.11778.

Four pediatric PEL cases with t(1;16)(p31;q24) NFIA-CBFA2T3 were reported previously. We present a case of an infant with PEL presenting with erythroblastic sarcoma and harboring a novel t(1;8)(p31.3;q21.3) NFIA-RUNX1T1 fusion detected by RNA sequencing and conventional karyotype. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) and abdominal mass biopsies from the patient were evaluated with extensive immunohistochemical, flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular studies. RESULTS: The patient was a female infant who presented between 2 and 5 months of age with cytopenias and an enlarging abdominal mass. Blasts in the BM and abdominal mass expressed CD71 and CD117 with focal expression of CD43, E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen, and hemoglobin A. They were negative for additional myeloid, lymphoid, and nonhematolymphoid markers. These findings were most consistent with PEL and erythroblastic sarcoma. RNA sequencing revealed the novel NFIA-RUNX1T1 fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Along with the previously reported PELs with NFIA-CBFA2T3 fusions, we describe a subset of PELs that occur in children, that frequently display extramedullary disease, and that harbor rearrangements of NFIA with core binding factor genes. We hypothesize that, together, these cases represent a rare but distinct clinicopathologic group of pediatric PELs with recurrent genetic abnormality.","['King, Rebecca L', 'Siaghani, Parwiz J', 'Wong, Katy', 'Edlefsen, Kerstin', 'Shane, Lisa', 'Howard, Matthew T', 'Reichard, Kaaren K', 'Mai, Ming', 'Viswanatha, David S', 'Greipp, Patricia T', 'Goble, Tony A', 'Ruiz, Maritza', 'Hara, Harneet']","['King RL', 'Siaghani PJ', 'Wong K', 'Edlefsen K', 'Shane L', 'Howard MT', 'Reichard KK', 'Mai M', 'Viswanatha DS', 'Greipp PT', 'Goble TA', 'Ruiz M', 'Hara H']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['* NFIA', '* RUNX1T1', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Core binding factor', '*Erythroid sarcoma', '*Infant leukemia', '*Myeloid sarcoma', '*Pure erythroid leukemia']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2020/12/14 11:02'],"['2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 11:02 [entrez]']","['6032724 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqaa216 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2021 Jun 17;156(1):129-138. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqaa216.,20210826,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

RESULTS: Despite a common theme of KIT mutation (particularly D816V), mastocytosis is a heterogeneous neoplasm with a wide variety of presentations. This spectrum, including rare subtypes and extramedullary organ involvement, is discussed and illustrated by representative cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the age of targeted treatment aimed at KIT, the accurate diagnosis and classification of mastocytosis has major implications for therapy and further interventions.

A few methods have been developed to investigate the tumor clonality of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), but currently there is no clinically translatable method available for quantifying individual tumor clones in ATLL patients. Here, we present a methodology to assess the tumor clonality of ATLL and quantify patient-specific tumor clones in a clinical setting. The methodology consists of three steps: (1) selective amplification of restriction fragments containing a human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) integration site, (2) amplicon deep sequencing to estimate the clonal structure and identify HTLV-1 integration sites of dominant clones, and (3) digital PCR targeting the HTLV-1 integration sites of the dominant clones to quantify specific tumor clones. We successfully tracked individual tumor clones using this approach and demonstrated that each clone had a distinct response to therapies. The procedure is straightforward and clinically feasible, which should facilitate the proper assessment and management of ATLL.","['Yamakawa, Tomohiro', 'Uno, Naoki', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Kaku, Norihito', 'Sakamoto, Kei', 'Kosai, Kosuke', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori']","['Yamakawa T', 'Uno N', 'Sasaki D', 'Kaku N', 'Sakamoto K', 'Kosai K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Yanagihara K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201022,United States,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,Molecular therapy.

However, the molecular basis for BMSC-associated AML chemoresistance remains largely unexplored. Methods: The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) levels of AML cells were measured by a Seahorse XFe24 cell metabolic analyzer. The activity of total or mitochondrial signal transducer and transcription activator 3 (STAT3) in AML cells was explored by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Real-time quantitative PCR, Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to analyze expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the human BMSC line HS-5, and IL-6 was knocked out in HS-5 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 system. Results: In this study, we observed that co-culturing with BMSCs heightened OXPHOS levels in AML cells, thus promoting chemoresistance in these cells. HS-5 cell-induced upregulation of OXPHOS is dependent on the activation of STAT3, especially on that of mitochondrial serine phosphorylated STAT3 (pS-STAT3) in AML cells. The relationship among pS-STAT3, OXPHOS, and chemosensitivity of AML cells induced by BMSCs was demonstrated by the STAT3 activator and inhibitor, which upregulated and downregulated the levels of mitochondrial pS-STAT3 and OXPHOS, respectively. Intriguingly, AML cells remodeled HS-5 cells to secrete more IL-6, which augmented mitochondrial OXPHOS in AML cells and stimulated their chemoresistance. IL-6 knockout in HS-5 cells impaired the ability of these cells to activate STAT3, to increase OXPHOS, or to promote chemoresistance in AML cells. Conclusions: BMSCs promoted chemoresistance in AML cells via the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/OXPHOS pathway. These findings exhibit a novel mechanism of chemoresistance in AML cells in the bone marrow microenvironment from a metabolic perspective.","['Hou, Diyu', 'Wang, Bin', 'You, Ruolan', 'Wang, Xiaoting', 'Liu, Jingru', 'Zhan, Weiwu', 'Chen, Ping', 'Qin, Tiandi', 'Zhang, Xuehao', 'Huang, Huifang']","['Hou D', 'Wang B', 'You R', 'Wang X', 'Liu J', 'Zhan W', 'Chen P', 'Qin T', 'Zhang X', 'Huang H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-6/STAT3/OXPHOS axis', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'chemosensitivity', 'stromal cells']",2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:01,['2020/12/14 10:59'],"['2020/12/14 10:59 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-20-3191 [doi]', 'atm-08-21-1346 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2020 Nov;8(21):1346. doi: 10.21037/atm-20-3191.,,['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

We describe an unusual manifestation of bacterial furunculosis which arose as an isotopic response following a herpes zoster episode. The initial skin disease in most cases is herpes zoster and the isotopic response is a granulomatous reaction. A 65-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and currently on chemotherapy regimen presented with a pustular skin rash on the posterior scalp extending to the posterior right neck and shoulder. Prior to this presentation, the patient was treated for three weeks with valacyclovir for herpes zoster infection which improved her skin condition. During the current hospitalization, the patient's wound cultures from the pustule revealed the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although the patient was on immunosuppressive therapy, her white blood cell (WBC) count increased to 9.9 x 10(3)/muL. After receiving vancomycin and valacyclovir, her cutaneous condition eventually improved. She was transitioned to oral clindamycin and discharged to a rehabilitation facility. This case describes an immunocompromised patient who was treated for herpes zoster, improved after treatment, and then developed MRSA furunculosis at the same site. It is of significance to report such manifestations, especially in immunocompromised patients, as it could be underdiagnosed. It is also important to inquire about the patients' herpes-related medical history because herpes is the most common initial dermatosis reported in the literature. In such cases of suspected WIR, it is vital to obtain a biopsy before starting treatment with antiviral medication to rule out the possibility of malignancy.","['Munir, Syed', 'Abu-Jubara, Dania', 'Abu-Jubara, Musa', 'Antypas, Carla', 'Petro-Sakuma, Cameron']","['Munir S', 'Abu-Jubara D', 'Abu-Jubara M', 'Antypas C', 'Petro-Sakuma C']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201108,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['dermatosis', 'furunculosis', 'herpes zoster virus', 'post-herpetic isotopic response', 'postherpetic neuralgia', 'shingle skin rash', ""wolf's isotopic response""]",2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:01,['2020/12/14 10:58'],"['2020/12/14 10:58 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.11381 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Nov 8;12(11):e11381. doi: 10.7759/cureus.11381.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Munir et al.']","['Internal Medicine, Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Fort Smith, USA.', 'Emergency Medicine, Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Fort Smith, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Fort Smith, USA.', 'Family Medicine, Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Fort Smith, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Unity Health, Searcy, USA.']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,PMC7723431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: To obtain a library with enough diversity, we collected about 2,395 soil samples and 2,324 plant samples from 36 regions in Africa, Asia, and North America. The collection areas covered various climate zones in the world. We examined the usability of the global fungal extract library (GFEL) against parasitic malaria transmission, Gram-positive and negative bacterial pathogens, and leukemia cells. Results: Nearly ten thousand fungal strains were isolated. Sequences of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) from 40 randomly selected strains showed that over 80% were unique. Screening GFEL, we found that the fungal extract from Penicillium thomii was able to block Plasmodium falciparum transmission to Anopheles gambiae, and the fungal extract from Tolypocladium album was able to kill myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. We also identified a set of candidate fungal extracts against bacterial pathogens.","['Niu, Guodong', 'Annamalai, Thirunavukkarasu', 'Wang, Xiaohong', 'Li, Sheng', 'Munga, Stephen', 'Niu, Guomin', 'Tse-Dinh, Yuk-Ching', 'Li, Jun']","['Niu G', 'Annamalai T', 'Wang X', 'Li S', 'Munga S', 'Niu G', 'Tse-Dinh YC', 'Li J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201127,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-leukemia', 'Anti-malaria', 'Antibiotics', 'Drugs', 'Fungus', 'Natural product', 'Secondary metabolites', 'Small molecule']",2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:01,['2020/12/14 10:58'],"['2020/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 10:58 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.10392 [doi]', '10392 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2020 Nov 27;8:e10392. doi: 10.7717/peerj.10392. eCollection 2020.,,['(c)2020 Niu et al.'],"['Department of Biological Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States of America.', 'School of Public Health, City University of New York, NY, United States of America.', 'Center for Global Health Research, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Kisumu, Kenya.', 'Department of Hematology, Southern Medical University Affiliated Nanhai Hospital, Foshan, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States of America.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Institute, Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States of America.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Institute, Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States of America.']",,,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],,['R01 AI125657/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7703384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent studies imply that ROS, formed by NOX2(+) myeloid cells in the malignant microenvironment, exert multiple actions of relevance to the growth and spread of neoplastic cells. By generating ROS, tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and NOX2(+) leukemic myeloid cells may thus (i) compromise the function and viability of adjacent cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, (ii) oxidize DNA to trigger cancer-promoting somatic mutations, and (iii) affect the redox balance in cancer cells to control their proliferation and survival. Here, we discuss the impact of NOX2-derived ROS for tumorigenesis, tumor progression, regulation of antitumor immunity, and metastasis.

Drug-resistant cancer cells in these hematologic neoplasms are induced by overexpression of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein families, such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1. We have previously shown that peptides from the BH3 domain of the proapoptotic Bax protein that also belongs to the Bcl-2 family may antagonize the antiapoptotic activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins, restore apoptosis, and induce chemosensitization of tumor cells. Furthermore, cell-permeable Bax BH3 peptides also elicit antitumor activity and extend survival in a murine xenograft model of human B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the activity of the BH3 peptides of the proapoptotic Bak protein of the Bcl-2 family against these hematologic malignant cells requires further characterization. In this study, we report the ability of the cell-permeable Bak BH3 peptide to restore apoptosis and induce chemosensitization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines, and this event is enhanced with the coadministration of cell-permeable Bax BH3 peptide and represents an attractive approach to improve the patient outcomes with relapsed or refractory hematological malignant cells.","['Ugarte-Alvarez, Omar', 'Munoz-Lopez, Paola', 'Moreno-Vargas, Liliana Marisol', 'Prada-Gracia, Diego', 'Mateos-Chavez, Armando Alfredo', 'Becerra-Baez, Elayne Irene', 'Luria-Perez, Rosendo']","['Ugarte-Alvarez O', 'Munoz-Lopez P', 'Moreno-Vargas LM', 'Prada-Gracia D', 'Mateos-Chavez AA', 'Becerra-Baez EI', 'Luria-Perez R']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6160-417X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4968-6288', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2812-1499', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3375-870X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1050-4491', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7587-092X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5822-6956']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201130,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:01,['2020/12/14 10:56'],"['2020/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 10:56 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/2679046 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2020 Nov 30;2020:2679046. doi: 10.1155/2020/2679046. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Omar Ugarte-Alvarez et al.'],"[""Unit of Investigative Research on Oncological Diseases, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico."", ""Unit of Investigative Research on Oncological Diseases, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico."", 'Posgrado en Biomedicina y Biotecnologia Molecular, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico City 11340, Mexico.', ""Research Unit on Computational Biology and Drug Design, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico."", ""Research Unit on Computational Biology and Drug Design, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico."", ""Unit of Investigative Research on Oncological Diseases, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico."", ""Unit of Investigative Research on Oncological Diseases, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico."", 'Posgrado en Biomedicina y Biotecnologia Molecular, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico City 11340, Mexico.', ""Unit of Investigative Research on Oncological Diseases, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico.""]",,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7721494,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the development of targeted therapies, such as the B-cell receptor signaling inhibitors and the Bcl-2 protein inhibitor venetoclax, has dramatically changed the treatment landscape of CLL. Despite their remarkable anti-tumor activity, targeted agents have some limitations, which include the development of drug resistance mechanisms and the inferior efficacy observed in high-risk patients. Therefore, additional treatments are necessary to obtain deeper responses and overcome drug resistance. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which exploits immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect to eradicate tumor cells, currently represents the only potentially curative therapeutic option for CLL patients. However, due to its potential toxicities, HSCT can be offered only to a restricted number of younger and fit patients. The growing understanding of the complex interplay between tumor cells and the immune system, which is responsible for immune escape mechanisms and tumor progression, has paved the way for the development of novel immune-based strategies. Despite promising preclinical observations, results from pilot clinical studies exploring the safety and efficacy of novel immune-based therapies have been sometimes suboptimal in terms of long-term tumor control. Therefore, further advances to improve their efficacy are needed. In this context, possible approaches include an earlier timing of immunotherapy within the treatment sequencing, as well as the possibility to improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents by administering them in combination with other anti-tumor drugs. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of main immune defects affecting patients with CLL, also describing the complex networks leading to immune evasion and tumor progression. From the therapeutic standpoint, we will go through the evolution of immune-based therapeutic approaches over time, including i) agents with broad immunomodulatory effects, such as immunomodulatory drugs, ii) currently approved and next-generation monoclonal antibodies, and iii) immunotherapeutic strategies aiming at activating or administering immune effector cells specifically targeting leukemic cells (e.g. bi-or tri-specific antibodies, tumor vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and checkpoint inhibitors).","['Griggio, Valentina', 'Perutelli, Francesca', 'Salvetti, Chiara', 'Boccellato, Elia', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Vitale, Candida', 'Coscia, Marta']","['Griggio V', 'Perutelli F', 'Salvetti C', 'Boccellato E', 'Boccadoro M', 'Vitale C', 'Coscia M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201118,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cellular therapy', '*chimeric antigen receptor T cells', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*immune dysfunction', '*immunomodulation', '*immunotherapy', '*targeted therapy']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/12/14 10:56'],"['2020/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 10:56 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.594556 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 18;11:594556. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.594556. eCollection 2020.,20210623,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Griggio, Perutelli, Salvetti, Boccellato, Boccadoro, Vitale', 'and Coscia.']","['University Division of Hematology, A.O.U.

CML responds well to therapy targeting BCR-ABL in the chronic phase but is resistant to treatment when it progresses to the blast phase (BP). This study attempted to address whether arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (Alox12) confers to CML drug resistance. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the expression of Alox12 using Western blotting, ELISA, and RT-PCR methods. Loss of functional analysis was performed using cellular activity assays on CML and normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Results: Alox12 and 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) are overexpressed in BP-CML but not HSPCs, and that Alox12-12-HETE axis is regulated by BCR-ABL. The Alox12-12-HETE axis is required for CML. Specific Alox12 inhibitor inhibits colony formation, survival, and self-renewal capacity in BP-CML HSPCs, and to a significantly greater extent than in normal HSPCs. Of note, the Alox12 inhibitor significantly augments dasatinib's efficacy in BP-CML HSPCs. Mechanism studies show that Alox12 inhibition does not affect activities of essential signaling pathways involved in maintaining stem cell function, such as Wnt, p53, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). In contrast, we show that Alox12 inhibition disrupts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) homeostasis and induces oxidative stress and damage in CML HSPCs and committed cells. Conclusion: Alox12-12-HETE axis is a specific and critical regulator of BP-CML HSPCs functions. Pharmacological inhibition of Alox12 may be useful in BP-CML.","['Gao, Si', 'Hu, Jialin', 'Li, Yong']","['Gao S', 'Hu J', 'Li Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201203,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alox12', 'Bcr-Abl', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'resistance', 'stem cell']",2020/12/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:01,['2020/12/14 10:55'],"['2020/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 10:55 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S280554 [doi]', '280554 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Dec 3;12:12509-12517. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S280554. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Gao et al.'],"[""Department of Haematology and Rheumatology, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", ""The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430014, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of General Medicine, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Wuhan Fourth Hospital; Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China.""]",,,['All authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,PMC7726836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 79 patients with hematologic malignancies who received MSD-HSCT. All patients received standard graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and short-term methotrexate. Among them, 38 were administered 5 mg/kg rATG as part of GVHD prophylaxis. Clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS), GVHD and relapse were analyzed. Results: No graft failure occurred in the antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or non-ATG group. The cumulative incidences of grade 2-4 and 3-4 acute GVHD at day +100 were 13.3% versus 19.5% (p=0.507) and 5.7% versus 15.2% (p=0.196), respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 35.4% and 60.4% (p=0.039), and those of extensive cGVHD were 12.9% and 40.0% (p=0.015), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the use of low-dose rATG was an independent protective factor for extensive cGVHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.256; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.080 to 0.822, p=0.022). The 2-year OS was 88.1% and 68.4% (p=0.038), respectively, and the use of low-dose rATG was the only protective factor in the multivariate analysis (HR 0.216; 95% CI, 0.059 to 0.792, p=0.021). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse, leukemia-free survival or GVHD-free and relapse-free survival.

Nevertheless, studying intercellular crosstalk in vivo remains a relevant challenge, due mainly to the difficulty in spatially locating the surroundings of particular cells in the tissue. Cherry-niche is a powerful new method that enables cells expressing a fluorescent protein to label their surrounding cells, facilitating their specific isolation from the whole tissue as live cells. We previously applied Cherry-niche in cancer research to study the tumor microenvironment (TME) in metastasis. Here we describe how to generate cancer cells with the ability to label their neighboring cells (within the tumor niche) by transferring a liposoluble fluorescent protein. Live niche cells can be isolated and compared with cells distant from the tumor bulk, using a variety of ex vivo approaches. As previously shown, this system has the potential to identify novel components in the TME and improve our understanding of their local interactions. Importantly, Cherry-niche can also be applied to study potential cell-cell interactions due to in vivo proximity in research fields beyond cancer.

Here, we report the empirical application of a targeted 40-gene panel developed for use in mature lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) and report our experience on over 500 cases submitted for MPS during the first year of its clinical use. MPS was applied to both fresh and fixed specimens. The most frequent diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (116), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (60), marginal zone lymphoma (52), and follicular lymphoma (43), followed by a spectrum of mature T-cell neoplasms (40). Of 534 cases submitted, 471 generated reportable results in MLNs, with disease-associated variants (DAVs) detected in 241 cases (51.2%). The most frequent DAVs affected TP53 (30%), CREBBP (14%), MYD88 (14%), TNFRSF14 (10%), TNFAIP3 (10%), B2M (7%), and NOTCH2 (7%). The bulk of our findings confirm what is reported in the scientific literature. While a substantial majority of mutations did not directly impact diagnosis, MPS results were utilized to either change, refine, or facilitate the final diagnosis in ~10.8% of cases with DAVs and 5.5% of cases overall. In addition, we identified preanalytic variables that significantly affect assay performance highlighting items for specimen triage. We demonstrate the technical viability and utility of the judicious use of a targeted MPS panel that may help to establish general guidelines for specimen selection and diagnostic application in MLNs in routine clinical practice.","['Davis, Adam R', 'Stone, Sara L', 'Oran, Amanda R', 'Sussman, Robyn T', 'Bhattacharyya, Siddharth', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Davis AR', 'Stone SL', 'Oran AR', 'Sussman RT', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Morrissette JJD', 'Bagg A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7949-4116'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201212,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,,,2020/12/15 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/14 10:51'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 10:51 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-020-00720-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-020-00720-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2021 May;34(5):904-921. doi: 10.1038/s41379-020-00720-7.

While BD has been classified as a known human carcinogen, a long-standing question is the identity of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite in humans. We hypothesize that 3,4-epoxybutane-1,2-diol (EBD) may play a critical role in human carcinogenesis due to its high bioavailability. We utilized a differential toxicity assay for BD metabolites and newly synthesized EBD analogs in a series of isogenic chicken cells lacking specific DNA repair proteins to address the mode of action of BD genotoxicity and infer a mode of action. Surprisingly, as with the diepoxide 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), the monoepoxide EBD showed remarkable toxicity to cells deficient in Fanconi anemia (FANC) genes. This observation suggests that EBD may be transformed into a bifunctional metabolite and forms interstrand cross-links. EBD and its analog with a hydroxy substituent at C1 were found to be highly toxic to FANCD2-deficient chicken and human cells. The Results suggest that EBD may be transformed to a bifunctional epoxy aldehyde, perhaps by alcohol dehydrogenase, to which the observed FANC sensitivity could be attributed. The implications of this study are very important in considering mechanisms by which EBD may cause leukemia and lymphoma in humans exposed to BD.","['Nakamura, Jun', 'Carro, Sujey', 'Gold, Avram', 'Zhang, Zhenfa']","['Nakamura J', 'Carro S', 'Gold A', 'Zhang Z']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201130,England,Chemosphere,Chemosphere,0320657,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Alcohol dehydrogenase', 'Butadiene', 'DEB', 'DSB', 'EBD', 'FANCD2']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/12/14 10:36'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 10:36 [entrez]']","['S0045-6535(20)33346-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129149 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemosphere. 2021 Mar;266:129149. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129149.

Most tumours are characterized by poorly differentiated cell populations exhibiting a marked loss of traits associated to communication and tissue homeostasis. DTH has been suggested as an alternative (or complement) to cytotoxic-based approaches, and has proven successful in some specific types of cancer such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). While novel drugs favouring the activation of differentiation therapies are being tested, several open problems emerge in relation to its effectiveness on solid tumors. Here we present a mathematical framework to DTH based on a well-known ecological model used to describe habitat loss. The models presented here account for some of the observed clinical and in vitro outcomes of DTH, providing relevant insight into potential therapy design. Furthermore, the same ecological approach is tested in a hierarchical model that accounts for cancer stem cells, highlighting the role of niche specificity in CSC therapy resistance. We show that the lessons learnt from metapopulation ecology can help guide future developments and potential difficulties of DTH.","['Sole, Ricard', 'Aguade-Gorgorio, Guim']","['Sole R', 'Aguade-Gorgorio G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201210,England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Cancer stem cells', '*Differentiation therapy', '*Ecology', '*Evolution', '*Habitat loss', '*Metapopulations']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/14 10:14'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 10:14 [entrez]']","['S0022-5193(20)30407-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110552 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2021 Feb 21;511:110552. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110552.

UCART19 is one such product investigated in children and adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Two multicentre phase 1 studies aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and antileukaemic activity of UCART19 in children and adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: We enrolled paediatric or adult patients in two ongoing, multicentre, phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and antileukaemic activity of UCART19. All patients underwent lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without alemtuzumab, then children received UCART19 at 1.1-2.3 x 10(6) cells per kg and adults received UCART19 doses of 6 x 10(6) cells, 6-8 x 10(7) cells, or 1.8-2.4 x 10(8) cells in a dose-escalation study. The primary outcome measure was adverse events in the period between first infusion and data cutoff. These studies were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02808442 and NCT02746952. FINDINGS: Between June 3, 2016, and Oct 23, 2018, seven children and 14 adults were enrolled in the two studies and received UCART19. Cytokine release syndrome was the most common adverse event and was observed in 19 patients (91%); three (14%) had grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome. Other adverse events were grade 1 or 2 neurotoxicity in eight patients (38%), grade 1 acute skin graft-versus-host disease in two patients (10%), and grade 4 prolonged cytopenia in six patients (32%). Two treatment-related deaths occurred; one caused by neutropenic sepsis in a patient with concurrent cytokine release syndrome and one from pulmonary haemorrhage in a patient with persistent cytopenia. 14 (67%) of 21 patients had a complete response or complete response with incomplete haematological recovery 28 days after infusion. Patients not receiving alemtuzumab (n=4) showed no UCART19 expansion or antileukaemic activity. The median duration of response was 4.1 months with ten (71%) of 14 responders proceeding to a subsequent allogeneic stem-cell transplant. Progression-free survival at 6 months was 27%, and overall survival was 55%. INTERPRETATION: These two studies show, for the first time, the feasibility of using allogeneic, genome-edited CAR T cells to treat patients with aggressive leukaemia. UCART19 exhibited in-vivo expansion and antileukaemic activity with a manageable safety profile in heavily pretreated paediatric and adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The results this study are an encouraging step forward for the field of allogeneic CAR T cells, and UCART19 offers the opportunity to treat patients with rapidly progressive disease and where autologous CAR-T-cell therapy is unavailable.

Irrespective of its unfavorable structure profile, independent research efforts recently led to the generation of highly potent MCL-1 inhibitors that are currently evaluated in clinical trials. This offers new perspectives to target a so far undruggable cancer cell dependency. However, a detailed understanding about the tumor and tissue type specific implications of MCL-1 are a prerequisite for the optimal (i.e., precision medicine guided) use of this novel drug class. In this review, we summarize the major functions of MCL-1 with a special focus on cancer, provide insights into its different roles in solid vs. hematological tumors and give an update about the (pre)clinical development program of state-of-the-art MCL-1 targeting compounds. We aim to raise the awareness about the heterogeneous role of MCL-1 as drug target between, but also within tumor entities and to highlight the importance of rationale treatment decisions on a case by case basis.","['Bolomsky, Arnold', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Kose, Murat Cem', 'Heckman, Caroline A', 'Ehx, Gregory', 'Ludwig, Heinz', 'Caers, Jo']","['Bolomsky A', 'Vogler M', 'Kose MC', 'Heckman CA', 'Ehx G', 'Ludwig H', 'Caers J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3175-1195'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201211,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*BCL-2', '*Cancer', '*Dependency', '*Inhibitor', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma', '*MCL-1', '*Melanoma', '*Myeloid cell leukemia 1', '*Myeloma']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/12/14 09:52'],"['2020/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/14 09:52 [entrez]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-01007-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-01007-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Dec 11;13(1):173. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-01007-9.,20210607,,"['Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege, CHU De Liege, 35, Dom Univ Sart Tilman B, 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland-FIMM, HiLIFE-Helsinki Institute of Life Science, iCAN Digital Cancer Medicine Flagship, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege, CHU De Liege, 35, Dom Univ Sart Tilman B, 4000, Liege, Belgium. jo.caers@chu.ulg.ac.be.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Development', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,,PMC7731749,,,,,,,['J Hematol Oncol. 2021 Feb 17;14(1):31.

Anoikis resistance is a hallmark feature of metastatic melanoma to escape apoptosis when cells lose contact with adjacent cells or extracellular matrix. The yes-associated protein transcription co-activator is the effector of Hippo pathway. Herein, we investigated the function of yes-associated protein in anoikis resistance of melanoma cells. When melanoma cells were grown under anchorage-independent condition, anoikis-resistant cells displayed higher levels of yes-associated protein activation than the cells that were attached to the basement membrane, as evidenced by downregulated phosphorylated yes-associated protein at Ser127 and higher expression of downstream genes BCL2 and MCL-1. Yes-associated protein overexpression directly enhanced the anoikis resistance and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. Conversely, yes-associated protein inhibitor CA3 exhibited Dose-dependent induction of anoikis in resistant melanoma cells and exerted great inhibition on cell migration. Knockdown of yes-associated protein expression by shRNA also rendered melanoma cells susceptible to anoikis and interrupted cell invasiveness. Yes-associated protein inhibition in anoikis-resistant cells also reduced the number of metastatic nodules in the lung sections of SCID mice. Clinically, higher yes-associated protein level in the lung metastasis tissues correlated with higher BCL2 and MCL1 expressions compared with the non-metastasis tissues. Overall, our finding suggests that the aberrant activation of yes-associated protein exerts important role on anoikis resistance and metastatic capability of melanoma cells.","['Zhao, Bei', 'Xie, Jun', 'Zhou, Xiyuan', 'Zhang, Lixia', 'Cheng, Xiankui', 'Liang, Chenglin']","['Zhao B', 'Xie J', 'Zhou X', 'Zhang L', 'Cheng X', 'Liang C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8375-307X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201213,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Melanoma', '*anoikis resistance', '*hippo signaling', '*metastasis', '*yes-associated protein']",2020/12/15 06:00,2021/10/06 06:00,['2020/12/14 09:48'],"['2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/14 09:48 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1535370220977101 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2021 Apr;246(8):888-896. doi: 10.1177/1535370220977101.

In addition, they are the leading causes of cancer-related death in childhood. High-grade gliomas account for 11% of such neoplasms and are characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and high morbidity and mortality. There is a lack of studies focusing on the factors that can prolong survival in these patients or guide therapeutic interventions. The authors aimed to investigate the factors related to longer survival durations, with a focus on reoperation for gross-total resection (GTR). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the authors analyzed 78 patients diagnosed with high-grade gliomas occurring across all CNS locations except diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Patients 0 to < 19 years of age were followed up at the Pediatric Oncology Institute. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed in the context of various prognostic factors, such as age, sex, histology, extent of tumor resection, reoperation for GTR, adjuvant treatment, and treatment initiation from 2010 onward. RESULTS: With a mean age at diagnosis of 8.7 years, 50% of the patients were female and approximately 39% underwent GTR at some point, which was already achieved in approximately 46% of them in the first surgery. The median OS was 17 months, and PFS was 10 months. In terms of median OS, the authors found no significant difference between those with reoperation for GTR and patients without GTR during treatment. Significant differences were observed in the OS in terms of the extent of resection in the first surgery, age, sex, Ki-67 expression, adjuvant treatment, and treatment initiation from 2010 onward. Furthermore, the PFS values significantly differed between those with GTR in the first surgery and Ki-67 expression >/= 50%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of GTR for these neoplasms, highlights the role of surgeons in its achievement in the first attempt, and questions the role of reoperation for this purpose. Finally, this study further supports the use of combined adjuvant treatment for the improvement of OS and PFS.","['Silva da Costa, Marcos Devanir', 'Camargo, Nicole Cavalari', 'Dastoli, Patricia Alessandra', 'Nicacio, Jardel Mendonca', 'Benevides Silva, Frederico Adolfo', 'Sucharski Figueiredo, Maria Luisa', 'Chen, Michael Jenwei', 'Cappellano, Andrea Maria', 'Saba da Silva, Nasjla', 'Cavalheiro, Sergio']","['Silva da Costa MD', 'Camargo NC', 'Dastoli PA', 'Nicacio JM', 'Benevides Silva FA', 'Sucharski Figueiredo ML', 'Chen MJ', 'Cappellano AM', 'Saba da Silva N', 'Cavalheiro S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201211,United States,J Neurosurg Pediatr,Journal of neurosurgery.

We retrieved up to 1233 articles, based a rigorous selection criterion, only 197 articles were extensively reviewed. We selected articles only addressing TNBC, but not other types of breast cancer, with the employed approach being miRNA analysis and/or profiling. Our extensive review resulted in grouping of miRNAs into categories in which specific members of miRNAs have roles in specific mechanism in TNBC i.e., carcinogenesis, invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. TNBC is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer; therefore, different approaches for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and treatment are needed. In this review we summarize the up-to-date miRNA profiling, prognostic, and therapeutic findings that add to the route of controlling TNBC.","['Sabit, Hussein', 'Cevik, Emre', 'Tombuloglu, Huseyin', 'Abdel-Ghany, Shaimaa', 'Tombuloglu, Guzin', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Sabit H', 'Cevik E', 'Tombuloglu H', 'Abdel-Ghany S', 'Tombuloglu G', 'Esteller M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201209,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Epigenomics', 'Metastasis', 'MicroRNAs', 'Neoplasm', 'Triple negative breast cancer']",2020/12/12 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/12/11 20:10'],"['2019/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 20:10 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(20)30332-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.103196 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2021 Jan;157:103196. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.103196.

In a molecularly related B-cell malignant tumor (classic Hodgkin lymphoma), tumor Reed-Sternberg cells overexpress oncogenic (proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) 1, 2, and 3 kinases in a NF-kappaB- and STAT-dependent manner and PIMs enhance survival and expression of immunomodulatory molecules. Given the multiple overlapping characteristics of Reed-Sternberg and PMBL cells, we hypothesized that PIM kinases may be overexpressed in PMBL and involved in PMBL pathogenesis. The expression of PIM kinases in PMBL diagnostic biopsy specimens was assessed and their role in survival and immune escape of the tumor cells was determined. PIMs were abundantly expressed in primary tumors and PMBL cell lines. Inhibition of PIM kinases was toxic to PMBL cells, attenuated protein translation, and down-regulated NF-kappaB- and STAT-dependent transcription of prosurvival factors BCL2A1, BCL2L1, and FCER2. Furthermore, PIM inhibition decreased expression of molecules engaged in shaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment, including programmed death ligand 1/2 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17. Taken together, our data indicate that PIMs support PMBL cell survival and immune escape and identify PIMs as promising therapeutic targets for PMBL.","['Szydlowski, Maciej', 'Debek, Sonia', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek, Monika', 'Szolkowska, Malgorzata', 'Tomirotti, Andrea M', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw', 'Szumera-Cieckiewicz, Anna']","['Szydlowski M', 'Debek S', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek M', 'Szolkowska M', 'Tomirotti AM', 'Juszczynski P', 'Szumera-Cieckiewicz A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201208,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/12/11 20:09'],"['2020/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 20:09 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(20)30548-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2021 Mar;191(3):567-574. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.12.001.

METHODS: Bone marrow morphology, chromosomal karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) were used for the diagnosis and staging of the disease. Point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ABL1 gene were detected by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The patient was initially diagnosed as CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) with a chromosomal karyotype of 46,XX,t(5;9;22;6)(q13;q34;q11;q25), while FISH revealed presence of a variant Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Clonal evolution has occurred after 38 months of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, when cytogenetic analysis revealed coexisting t(5;9;22;6)(q13;q34;q11;q25) and t(5;9;22;6;17)(q13;q34;q11;q25;q11). After 57 months of TKIs treatment, only the t(5;9;22;6;17) clone was detected. Three months later, hyperdiploidy with additional abnormalities were detected in addition to t(5;9;22;6;17). Three mutations, including p.Tyr253Phe, p.Thr315Ile and p.Gly250Glu, were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the ABL1 gene during the course of disease. The patient did not attain cytogenetic and molecular response to TKIs. CONCLUSION: The four-way variant translocation may be genetically unstable. Clonal evolution and genetic mutations are likely to occur during TKIs treatment, resulting in poor response to drug therapy. This observation, however, needs to be confirmed by large-scale studies.","['Kong, Shu', 'Gu, Yuqing', 'Qin, Yazhen', 'Wang, Zheng', 'Feng, Lin', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Lai, Yueyun']","['Kong S', 'Gu Y', 'Qin Y', 'Wang Z', 'Feng L', 'Jiang Q', 'Lai Y']",,['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/01/06 06:00,['2020/12/11 17:09'],"['2020/12/11 17:09 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['940637259 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20191220-00650 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Dec 10;37(12):1395-1398. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20191220-00650.,20210105,,"[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. laiyueyun1008@sina.com.""]",['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)'],"['Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytogenetic findings of 1576 inpatients with primary MDS were retrospective analyzed, among which 9 were diagnosed with NT/T. Clinical data including gender, age, morphology, genetic feature and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of MDS patients with NT/T (NT/T-MDS) among all cases was 0.57%. Karyotyping analysis suggested that eight MDS patients had sole NT/T, while the remainder one had a complex karyotype. In addition to the typical morphology of MDS, NT/T-MDS had unique morphology including huge blast, double-nuclear cell and irregular nuclear membrane. One NT/T-MDS patient gave up therapy, and the remaining eight underwent the first course of treatment, albeit with poor prognosis. Only one patient had complete remission, one had partial remission, three had no remission; and three had converted to acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: NT/T-MDS is rare and has unique morphology. Generally, NT/T-MDS patients have poor prognosis. However, NT/T cannot be simply classified as high-risk group, but with consideration whether they have affected particular chromosomal structures as well as other clinical data.","['Wu, Juan', 'Lin, Huijie', 'Chen, Chengxuan', 'Luo, Yue', 'Dai, Wei', 'Lin, Xiaolan', 'Chen, Wanzi', 'Fu, Qiang', 'Yuan, Qin', 'Chen, Jiadi']","['Wu J', 'Lin H', 'Chen C', 'Luo Y', 'Dai W', 'Lin X', 'Chen W', 'Fu Q', 'Yuan Q', 'Chen J']",,['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/01/06 06:00,['2020/12/11 17:09'],"['2020/12/11 17:09 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['940637244 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20191015-00530 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Dec 10;37(12):1336-1339. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20191015-00530.,20210105,,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350004, China. csuchenjiadi@163.com.']",,"['Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tetraploidy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe our experience of treating children with acute leukemia by haploidentical HSCT with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome data of 17 children with acute leukemia who underwent related haploidentical HSCT. Fifteen were in complete remission (CR) before HSCT: CR1-6, CR2-7, and CR3-2 and 2 were not in remission. Donors were mobilized with granulocyte colony stimulating factor. The conditioning was nonmyeloablative in 4 and myeloablative in 13. All received PTCy 50 mg/kg on days 3 and 4 as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis along with tacrolimus or cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. A median of 8.94 million of CD34+ cells/kg was infused. RESULTS: All patients were engrafted for neutrophil and platelets, except 1 child with refractory acute myeloid leukemia disease who relapsed before engraftment. Five children relapsed (4 died and 1 child with CD20-positive leukemia is disease free after Rituximab therapy). There was 1 transplant-related mortality due to grade IV GVHD. Remaining 11 patients are in CR. Acute GVHD was seen in 4 patients. Of 4, 3 children later developed chronic GVHD and all are alive and disease free. Three of 4 children who received nonmyeloablative conditioning have relapsed. Overall survival is 70.5% and event-free survival is 64.7%. Median follow-up of all patients was 393 days. CONCLUSION: Haploidentical HSCT with PTCy is a safe and effective therapy for children with acute leukemia. Myeloablative conditioning and chronic GVHD lead to improved disease-free survival.","['Sharma, Anil', 'Rastogi, Neha', 'Chatterjee, Goutomi', 'Kapoor, Rohit', 'Nivargi, Sagar', 'Yadav, Satya P']","['Sharma A', 'Rastogi N', 'Chatterjee G', 'Kapoor R', 'Nivargi S', 'Yadav SP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2022/01/06 06:00,['2020/12/11 17:08'],"['2020/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 17:08 [entrez]']","['00043426-202110000-00034 [pii]', '10.1097/MPH.0000000000002030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Oct 1;43(7):e1033-e1036. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000002030.,20220105,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We report the optimization of a series of amidopyridines (from compound 2), focusing on properties suitable for achieving short target engagement after intravenous administration. By increasing potency and human metabolic clearance, we identified compound 24, a potent and selective CDK9 inhibitor with suitable predicted human pharmacokinetic properties to deliver transient inhibition of CDK9. Furthermore, the solubility of 24 was considered adequate to allow i.v. formulation at the anticipated effective dose. Short-term treatment with compound 24 led to a rapid dose- and time-dependent decrease of pSer2-RNAP2 and Mcl-1, resulting in cell apoptosis in multiple hematological cancer cell lines. Intermittent dosing of compound 24 demonstrated efficacy in xenograft models derived from multiple hematological tumors.

The objective of this analysis was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model to characterize the PKs of zanubrutinib and identify the potential impact of intrinsic and extrinsic covariates on zanubrutinib PK. Data across nine clinical studies of patients with B-cell malignancies and data of healthy volunteers (HVs) were included in this analysis, at total daily doses ranging from 20 to 320 mg. In total, 4,925 zanubrutinib plasma samples from 632 subjects were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Zanubrutinib PKs were adequately described by a two-compartment model with sequential zero-order then first-order absorption, and first-order elimination. A time-dependent residual error model was implemented in order to better capture the observed maximum concentration variability in subjects. Baseline alanine aminotransferase and health status (HVs or patients with B-cell malignancies) were identified as statistically significant covariates on the PKs of zanubrutinib. These factors are unlikely to be clinically meaningful based on a sensitivity analysis. No statistically significant differences in the PKs of zanubrutinib were observed based on age, sex, race (Asian, white, and other), body weight, mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance >/= 30 mL/minute as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), baseline aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, tumor type, or use of acid-reducing agents (including proton pump inhibitors). These results support that no dose adjustment is considered necessary based on the aforementioned factors.","['Ou, Ying C', 'Liu, Lucy', 'Tariq, Bilal', 'Wang, Kun', 'Jindal, Ashutosh', 'Tang, Zhiyu', 'Gao, Yuying', 'Sahasranaman, Srikumar']","['Ou YC', 'Liu L', 'Tariq B', 'Wang K', 'Jindal A', 'Tang Z', 'Gao Y', 'Sahasranaman S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210125,United States,Clin Transl Sci,Clinical and translational science,101474067,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/11 12:10'],"['2020/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 12:10 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cts.12948 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Sci. 2021 Mar;14(2):764-772. doi: 10.1111/cts.12948.

We investigated the characteristics and prognostic value of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A deletions in 101 patients with T-ALL. The CDKN2A deletion was present in 23% (23/101) of T-ALL by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The most common type of CDKN2A deletion was homozygous deletion (70%, 16/23). A lower frequency of CDKN2A deletion was found in patients with early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL than in patients with non-ETP-ALL (10.4% vs 34.0%; P = .008). Deletion of CDKN2A was significantly associated with younger age (P = .001), higher white blood cell (WBC) count (P < .001) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P = .002). Patients with CDKN2A deletion had lower 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates than patients without CDKN2A deletion (2-year OS: 18.6% +/- 8.9% vs 47.4% +/- 6.2%, P = .032; EFS: 16.4 +/- 8.3 vs 38.6 +/- 5.9%, P = .022). In multivariable analysis, CDKN2A deletion was an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS (P = .016). In conclusion, adult T-ALL patients with CDKN2A deletion had a poor prognosis, and these patients might benefit from intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.","['Wang, Huan-Ping', 'Zhou, Yi-Le', 'Huang, Xin', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Qian, Jie-Jing', 'Li, Jian-Hu', 'Li, Xue-Ying', 'Li, Chen-Ying', 'Lou, Yin-Jun', 'Mai, Wen-Yuan', 'Meng, Hai-Tao', 'Yu, Wen-Juan', 'Tong, Hong-Yan', 'Jin, Jie', 'Zhu, Hong-Hu']","['Wang HP', 'Zhou YL', 'Huang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Qian JJ', 'Li JH', 'Li XY', 'Li CY', 'Lou YJ', 'Mai WY', 'Meng HT', 'Yu WJ', 'Tong HY', 'Jin J', 'Zhu HH']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4080-3329', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9216-5261', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3625-2288', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9609-1984', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5603-4160', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8166-9915', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2343-0436']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201224,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/12/11 12:09'],"['2020/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 12:09 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26069 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Mar 1;96(3):312-319. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26069.

In the absence of prior state-based Australian epidemiological studies, this retrospective cohort study reviewed all cases of invasive cancer diagnosed in Queensland children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) (0-39 years) from 1987 to 2016 using the Queensland Oncology Repository (QOR). Methods: Cancers were classified according to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) AYA site recode. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) were calculated. JoinPoint regression examined trends in ASRs across three age cohorts, for three decades (1987-1996, 1997-2006, and 2007-2016). Results: In total, 3,576 children aged 0-14 years (ASR = 15.2/100,000), 6,441 aged 15-24 years (ASR = 39.3/100,000), and 29,923 (ASR = 122.6/100,000) aged 25-39 years were diagnosed. Incidence increased for female children, and leukemia was the most common diagnosis. For those 15-24 years, incidence increased initially before decreasing and was higher than other nationally reported rates. For those 25-39 years, incidence increased. For the older cohorts, the most common diagnosis was melanoma. All cohorts demonstrated a decline in mortality and improvement in 5-year relative survival, with those 0-14 years demonstrating the greatest gains. The lowest survival for all cohorts was associated with central nervous system tumors. Conclusion: These results highlight areas in need of further investigation to improve survival, reduce the burden of cancer for young people, and aid service delivery. Future studies should focus on cancer biology, early detection, barriers in access to clinical trials, innovative models of care, improved data collection, and patient-reported outcomes.","['Holland, Lucy R', 'Bradford, Natalie K', 'Youl, Philippa', 'Cossio, Danica', 'Dunn, Nathan', 'Tran, Nancy', 'Walker, Rick']","['Holland LR', 'Bradford NK', 'Youl P', 'Cossio D', 'Dunn N', 'Tran N', 'Walker R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescent and young adult oncology', '*cancer epidemiology', '*cancer survivorship', '*childhood cancer']",2020/12/12 06:00,2021/12/25 06:00,['2020/12/11 12:07'],"['2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 12:07 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2020.0151 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Dec;10(6):629-644. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2020.0151.

Common clinical and radiological findings are often observed, and high neonatal mortality occurs due to respiratory distress and hyperthermic episodes. Despite initially considered as a lethal disorder during the newborn period, in recent years, several SWS childhood survivors have been reported. We report a detailed clinical and radiological characterization of four unrelated childhood SWS molecularly confirmed patients and review 22 previously reported childhood surviving cases. We contribute to the definition of the childhood survival phenotype of SWS, emphasizing the evolving phenotype, characterized by skeletal abnormalities with typical radiological findings, distinctive dysmorphic features, and dysautonomia. Based on the typical features and clinical course, early diagnosis is possible and crucial to plan appropriate management and prevent potential complications.

There are no population-based studies from the United States (U.S.) analyzing this association. The study aims to analyze the trends, predictors of mortality, and outcomes of VTE in AML patients.Methods: We analyzed the publicly available Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for years 2010-2014. Hospitalizations due to AML were identified by previously validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes as the primary diagnosis. VTE was identified by ICD-9-CM codes as secondary diagnosis. Hospitalizations with age less than 18 years of age were excluded. The trends and outcomes were determined using Chi-squared (chi2) test and multivariate regression models.Results: From 2010 to 2014, there were 313,282 hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of AML and 1,633 hospitalizations (0.1%) had VTE as a concurrent diagnosis. There was a significant increase in the proportion of AML hospitalizations with VTE from 0.47% in 2010 to 0.56% in 2014 (P = 0.014). Multivariable regression analysis showed that the odds of in-hospital mortality were not higher in AML hospitalizations with VTE (odds ratio [OR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-1.52; P = 0.5) than those without VTE. Age group above 84 years carried the highest risk of mortality (OR 3.20; 95% CI 2.77-3.70; P < 0.0001) in AML-VTE patients. Black (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.13-1.35; P < 0.0001) and uninsured patients (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.31-1.73; P < 0.0001) were at significantly higher odds of in-hospital mortality amongst the AML-VTE hospitalizations.Conclusion: The proportion of AML hospitalizations with VTE continues to rise in the U.S. After adjusting for confounders, increasing age, Black race, and lack of insurance were found to have higher risk of in-hospital mortality in the AML-VTE cohort. The odds of in-hospital mortality in AML hospitalizations with VTE are not higher than those without VTE.","['Khadka, Sushmita', 'Solanki, Dhanshree', 'Singh, Jagmeet', 'Kichloo, Asim', 'Patel, Neil R', 'Sharma, Purnima', 'Chugh, Savneek', 'Solanki, Shantanu']","['Khadka S', 'Solanki D', 'Singh J', 'Kichloo A', 'Patel NR', 'Sharma P', 'Chugh S', 'Solanki S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9563-2470'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201231,England,Postgrad Med,Postgraduate medicine,0401147,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Venous thromboembolism', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hospitalization trend', 'outcome']",2020/12/12 06:00,2021/03/19 06:00,['2020/12/11 08:38'],"['2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 08:38 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00325481.2020.1863717 [doi]'],ppublish,Postgrad Med. 2021 Mar;133(2):160-165. doi: 10.1080/00325481.2020.1863717.

Fluorescent staining and scanning electron micrographs of treated HL-60 cells demonstrated chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic blebs. There was a marked increase in hypodiploid population of cells as observed by cell cycle analysis. Annexin V-FITC/PI also depicted the presence of apoptotic cells. Anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was observed to be decreased by 62% at 20 microg/ml concentration and a significant increase in ROS production up to 6.9-fold was observed in time dependent manner. In addition, alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed, which was followed by cytochrome c release to cytoplasm. Activated levels of mitochondrial downstream pathway protein namely Caspase-3 and 9, were detected in treated HL-60 cells by colorimetric analysis. DNA ladder formation, a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis was also observed in treated HL-60 cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples of healthy, indoor, domestic cats selected to be potential blood donors were tested for feline leukaemia virus antigens, feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies and polymerase chain reactions for Mycoplasma haemofelis, Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum, Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis, feline leukaemia virus provirus, Leishmania spp. and Bartonella spp. Not all donors were tested for all agents. RESULTS: Overall, 5105 healthy indoor cats were tested and 8.1% (414/5105) had at least one subclinical infectious agent that is transmissible through blood product transfusion. 1.5% (77/5105) were positive for feline leukaemia virus antigens and 2.9% (148/5105) were positive for feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies, therefore they were excluded as donors. The overall prevalence of haemoplasmas in feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus SNAP-negative feline blood donors was 3.7% (181/4880) [1.3% (63/4880) were positive for Mycoplasma haemofelis; 2.3% (112/4880) to Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum and 0.12% (6/4880) to Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis]. The prevalence of feline leukaemia provirus was 5.2% (9/173) and of Bartonella spp. was 0.2% (2/1122). None of the 173 cats were positive for Leishmania spp. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of many transfusion transmissible pathogens was relatively high in this healthy, client-owned, indoor cats eligible to become blood donors. Performing an extended screening panel that includes at least polymerase chain reactions for Mycoplasma haemofelis, Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum, Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis, feline leukaemia virus provirus, and Bartonella spp., in addition to feline leukaemia virus antigens and feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies, is recommended in pet blood banks from analogous regions.","['Mesa-Sanchez, I', 'Ferreira, R R F', 'Cardoso, I', 'Morais, M', 'Flaminio, M', 'Vieira, S', 'de Gopegui, R R', 'de Matos, A J F']","['Mesa-Sanchez I', 'Ferreira RRF', 'Cardoso I', 'Morais M', 'Flaminio M', 'Vieira S', 'de Gopegui RR', 'de Matos AJF']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,England,J Small Anim Pract,The Journal of small animal practice,0165053,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/12/11 06:07'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 06:07 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jsap.13257 [doi]'],ppublish,J Small Anim Pract. 2021 Feb;62(2):107-113. doi: 10.1111/jsap.13257.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a novel hypo-fractionation strategy for patients receiving total marrow and involved lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) as part of the conditioning regimen before HSCT. Methods and Materials: 61 patients (7 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 33 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 18 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 3 mixed acute leukemia (MAL)) received conditioning radiation treatment with TMLI (8 Gy to bone marrow, 10 Gy to involved field in 2 fractions per day) in conjunction with chemotherapy before transplantation. Results: The median age of 61 patients with TMLI was 24 (4-54) years. The prescribed dose covered the entire bone and involved target volume, and the dose of organs at risk (OAR) was reduced by 28%-78% of the prescription dose. Grade 1-2 nausea and vomiting occurred in 12 patients and grade 1-2 pain in 6 patients during radiotherapy. Fatigue occurred in 16 patients. 2 patients had diarrhea, enteritis, and 1 patient had fever. None of patient had grade 3-4 non-hematologic adverse reactions. Late (30 days after HSCT) grade 2 toxicities including reversible enteritis occurred in 3 patients. 5 patients developed infectious pneumonia. The 2 years progression-free survival (PFS) was 64.1% (95% CI: 0.16-0.22) and overall survival (OS) was 74.7% (95% CI: 0.19-0.24) for the 61 patients who had received their planned HSCT. The 2-year non-relapse mortality was significantly reduced to 5% in this patient cohort. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that hypo-fractionated TMLI (8 Gy to bone marrow, 10 Gy to involved field in a single day) as a conditioning regimen for lymphoma and acute leukemia was feasible and the clinical outcomes were acceptable.","['Shi, Liu', 'Lu, Xuan', 'Deng, Di', 'Yang, Lijing', 'Zhao, Hongli', 'Shen, Jiuling', 'Wang, Xiaoyong', 'Xie, Conghua', 'Liu, An', 'Cao, Yang', 'Xiong, Yu']","['Shi L', 'Lu X', 'Deng D', 'Yang L', 'Zhao H', 'Shen J', 'Wang X', 'Xie C', 'Liu A', 'Cao Y', 'Xiong Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201112,Ireland,Clin Transl Radiat Oncol,Clinical and translational radiation oncology,101713416,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Helical tomotherapy', 'Lymphoma', 'Total marrow irradiation']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 06:05'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:05 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ctro.2020.11.004 [doi]', 'S2405-6308(20)30091-4 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Transl Radiat Oncol. 2020 Nov 12;26:42-46. doi: 10.1016/j.ctro.2020.11.004. eCollection 2021 Jan.,,"['(c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Society for', 'Radiotherapy and Oncology.']","['Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Biological Behaviors, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Cancer Study Center, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Biological Behaviors, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Cancer Study Center, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Biological Behaviors, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Cancer Study Center, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Biological Behaviors, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Cancer Study Center, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,PMC7708691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular assays for assessing clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin receptor (IGH) and T-cell receptor (TCR), commonly referred to as B- and T-cell clonality, as well as determination of IGH somatic mutation status, enables improved diagnostic accuracy and disease monitoring. Here we describe validation of NGS LymphoTrack (IGH, TCRG, Invivoscribe, Inc) with Ion Torrent S5 sequencing, which employs a different sequencing chemistry and has not been previously reported for NGS clonality to our knowledge. We also demonstrate the concordance of clonality by LymphoTrack with S5 sequencing with other molecular methodologies and with clinical measurements of disease. We show that LymphoTrack with S5 sequencing identifies previously detected IGH and TCRG clonal sequences across matched biopsy specimens and clinical timepoints, enabling more precise and sensitive disease monitoring for B- and T-cell cancers compared to PCR fragment or capillary sequencing. In sum, our study demonstrates that the LymphoTrack assays with Ion Torrent S5 sequencing 1) can be used successfully for IGH and TCR clonality with reproducible results; 2) generates and quantifies clonal sequences to enable highly precise comparison of samples; 3) are substantially more sensitive than PCR fragment and return clonality results in specimens that failed PCR fragment assays; and 4) the TCRG assays are highly concordant with clinical and histopathologic diagnoses. Taken together, the LymphoTrack with Ion S5 NGS clonality assays offer a sensitive and precise method for diagnostic testing and disease monitoring in B- and T-cell cancers.","['Lay, Lindsay', 'Stroup, Brooke', 'Payton, Jacqueline E']","['Lay L', 'Stroup B', 'Payton JE']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201125,Netherlands,Pract Lab Med,Practical laboratory medicine,101690848,,['NOTNLM'],"['Clonality', 'IGH', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'NGS', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'TCR', 'Validation']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 06:04'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.plabm.2020.e00191 [doi]', 'S2352-5517(20)30154-2 [pii]']",epublish,Pract Lab Med. 2020 Nov 25;22:e00191. doi: 10.1016/j.plabm.2020.e00191. eCollection 2020 Nov.,,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],"['Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.']",,,,,,PMC7718169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to the efforts of investigators throughout the world, the chemo-free concept has become a reality for both low- and high-risk patients. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide (ATO) without chemotherapy has become a first-line treatment for newly diagnosed APL and has been adopted in guidelines or expert recommendations from the NCCN and ELN and in China. Though the regimen has achieved great success, challenges still exist. The rate of early death still has not diminished significantly and is a major obstacle to curing all patients. Leukocytosis is the most important factor for ED, and completely abandoning chemotherapy is dangerous for certain patients in practice. To narrow the gap between guidelines and practice, this review aims to examine the history of the chemo-free model for the treatment of APL in the arsenic-alone era (1974-2002) and the arsenic plus ATRA era (2002-present) and provide practical considerations regarding early death.","['Zhu, Hong-Hu']",['Zhu HH'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201116,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATO', 'ATRA', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'early death']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 06:04'],"['2020/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:04 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.592996 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 16;10:592996. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.592996. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhu.'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",,,,,,PMC7701235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existence of fluidic shear stress in blood circulation seems not favorable for the binding of ligand modified nanodrugs with their target receptor. Namely, the binding feature is very essential in this case. Herein, we utilized HSPC, PEG-DSPE, cholesterol and two alphavbeta3 ligands (RGDm7 and DT4) with different binding rates to build dual-targeting nanovesicles, in an effort to achieve a ""fast-binding/slow-unbinding"" function. It was demonstrated that the dual-targeting nanovesicles actualized efficient cellular uptake and antitumor effect in vitro both for static and dynamic tumor cells. Besides, the potency of the dual-targeting vesicles for flowing tumor cells was better than that for static tumor cells. Then, a tumor metastasis mice model and a leukemia mice model were established to detect the killing ability of the drug-loaded dual-targeting vesicles to dynamic tumor cells in vivo. The therapy efficacy of the dual-targeting system was higher than other controls including single-targeting ones. Generally, it seems possible to strengthen drug-targeting to dynamic tumor cells via the control of ligand-receptor interaction.","['Song, Yang', 'Guo, Xiangfu', 'Fu, Jijun', 'He, Bing', 'Wang, Xueqing', 'Dai, Wenbing', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Zhang, Qiang']","['Song Y', 'Guo X', 'Fu J', 'He B', 'Wang X', 'Dai W', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang Q']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200725,Netherlands,Acta Pharm Sin B,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

Previously, we demonstrated CD4(+) T cells from healthy donors and IPEX patients can be converted into functional Treg-like cells by lentiviral transfer of FOXP3 (CD4(LVFOXP3)). These CD4(LVFOXP3) cells have potent regulatory function, suggesting their potential as an innovative therapeutic. Here, we present molecular and preclinical in vivo data supporting CD4(LVFOXP3) cell clinical progression. Methods: The molecular characterisation of CD4(LVFOXP3) cells included flow cytometry, qPCR, RNA-seq and TCR-seq. The in vivo suppressive function of CD4(LVFOXP3) cells was assessed in xenograft-versus-host disease (xeno-GvHD) and FOXP3-deficient IPEX-like humanised mouse models. The safety of CD4(LVFOXP3) cells was evaluated using peripheral blood (PB) humanised (hu)- mice testing their impact on immune response against pathogens, and immune surveillance against tumor antigens. Results: We demonstrate that the conversion of CD4(+) T cells to CD4(LVFOXP3) cells leads to specific transcriptional changes as compared to CD4(+) T-cell transduction in the absence of FOXP3, including upregulation of Treg-related genes. Furthermore, we observe specific preservation of a polyclonal TCR repertoire during in vitro cell production. Both allogeneic and autologous CD4(LVFOXP3) cells protect from xeno-GvHD after two sequential infusions of effector T cells. CD4(LVFOXP3) cells prevent hyper-proliferation of CD4(+) memory T cells in the FOXP3-deficient IPEX-like hu-mice. CD4(LVFOXP3) cells do not impede in vivo expansion of antigen-primed T cells or tumor clearance in the PB hu-mice. Conclusion: These data support the clinical readiness of CD4(LVFOXP3) cells to treat IPEX syndrome and other immune-mediated diseases caused by insufficient or dysfunctional FOXP3(+) Tregs.","['Sato, Yohei', 'Passerini, Laura', 'Piening, Brian D', 'Uyeda, Molly Javier', 'Goodwin, Marianne', 'Gregori, Silvia', 'Snyder, Michael P', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Roncarolo, Maria-Grazia', 'Bacchetta, Rosa']","['Sato Y', 'Passerini L', 'Piening BD', 'Uyeda MJ', 'Goodwin M', 'Gregori S', 'Snyder MP', 'Bertaina A', 'Roncarolo MG', 'Bacchetta R']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8042-0069'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201125,Australia,Clin Transl Immunology,Clinical & translational immunology,101638268,,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'FOXP3', 'IPEX syndrome', 'gene therapy', 'lentiviral vector', 'regulatory T cells']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 06:03'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/cti2.1214 [doi]', 'CTI21214 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Transl Immunology. 2020 Nov 25;9(11):e1214. doi: 10.1002/cti2.1214. eCollection 2020.,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Among the most notable effects of ACN is its antitumor activity against a wide array of cancer types. Thus, ACN may be a promising anticancer therapeutic. Nevertheless, chemotherapy-induced anemia is a major obstacle in cancer management with a prevalence of up to 70%. Although the pathophysiology behind it remains elusive, a number of medications known to cause anemia in patients have been shown to induce premature programmed cell death in red blood cells (RBCs) known as eryptosis. This study, thus, investigates the anticancer potential of ACN against THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells, its toxic effects on human RBCs, and delineate the underlying biochemical mechanisms. Methods: Cytotoxicity was detected using the MTT assay, while hemoglobin leakage was used as a surrogate for hemolysis which was photometrically measured. Major eryptotic events were examined using flow cytometry with fluorescent probes. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure was detected by Annexin-V-FITC, cytosolic calcium with Fluo4/AM, and reactive oxygen species with H2DCFDA. Results: Our results show that ACN induces hemolysis in a dose-dependent fashion, which is significantly abrogated in absence of extracellular calcium. Moreover, ACN stimulates PS exposure, intracellular calcium overload, and oxidative stress. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we demonstrate that the pro-eryptotic activity of ACN is ameliorated in presence of zVAD(OMe)-FMK, SB203580, and D4476. Conclusion: ACN possesses both hemolytic and eryptotic properties mediated through elevated intracellular calcium levels, oxidative stress, caspase, p38 MAPK, and CK1alpha.","['Sultan, Samar A', 'Khawaji, Mohammed H', 'Alsughayyir, Jawaher', 'Alfhili, Mohammad A', 'Alamri, Hassan S', 'Alrfaei, Bahauddeen M']","['Sultan SA', 'Khawaji MH', 'Alsughayyir J', 'Alfhili MA', 'Alamri HS', 'Alrfaei BM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200908,Saudi Arabia,Saudi J Biol Sci,Saudi journal of biological sciences,101543796,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allicin', 'CK1alpha', 'Calcium', 'Eryptosis', 'Phosphatidylserine']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 06:01'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.09.005 [doi]', 'S1319-562X(20)30402-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi J Biol Sci. 2020 Dec;27(12):3376-3384. doi: 10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.09.005.

Not surprisingly, racial differences in chromosomal aberrations (CA) in hematological malignancies could be found, and CA incidence in leukemia might change over time, possibly due to environmental and lifestyle changes. Thus, we compared the frequency and range of CA in patients with acute leukemia (AL) during two time periods (20062009 vs. 20102015) and compared them with other prior studies. Methods: We enrolled 717 patients with AL during a six-year period (20102015). We compared the results to those of our earlier study (20062009) [1]. Conventional cytogenetics, a multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR system, and fluorescence in situ hybridization were employed to assess bone marrow specimens or peripheral blood at the diagnostic stage in AL patients to detect CA. Results: The incidence of CA changed in the leukemia subgroups during the two time periods. Notably, the most frequent CA of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was PML/RARA, and was followed by RUNX1/RUNX1T1 in the current study. In contrast, the most common CA was RUNX1/RUNX1T1 in a previous study [1] and was followed by PML/RARA. In this study, the most frequent CA of the mixed phenotype AL was BCR/ABL1, which was followed by KMT2A/MLLT3. In a previous report, [1] the most frequent CA was BCR/ABL1, which was followed by KMT2A/ELL. Conclusion: The distribution of CA in Korean AL patients changed over time in a single institute. This change might be due to environmental and lifestyle changes.","['Park, Je-Hyun', 'Kang, Min-Gu', 'Kim, Hye-Ran', 'Lee, Young-Eun', 'Lee, Jun Hyung', 'Choi, Hyun-Jung', 'Shin, Jong-Hee', 'Shin, Myung-Geun']","['Park JH', 'Kang MG', 'Kim HR', 'Lee YE', 'Lee JH', 'Choi HJ', 'Shin JH', 'Shin MG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Chromosomal aberrations', 'Frequency', 'Spectra']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 05:51'],"['2020/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:51 [entrez]']","['br.2020.2020255 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2020.2020255 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2020 Dec 31;55(4):225-245. doi: 10.5045/br.2020.2020255.,,,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus program, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, GwangYang Sarang General Hospital, Gwangyang, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus program, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus program, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",,,,,,PMC7784131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib using real-life data from patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Waldenstr?m macroglobulinemia (WM), and follicular lymphoma (FL), especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Methods: This is a retrospective, observational, non-interventional, and single-center study on 32 patients who received ibrutinib treatment between January 2017 and March 2020 regardless of their diagnosis. Results: Of the 32 patients, 11 had CLL and 21 had other B-cell lymphomas. Patients with CLL were prescribed ibrutinib for a median of 4 months (range, 2?18). In this group, diarrhea was observed in 3 (27.3%), pneumonia in 3 (27.3%), and thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia in 2 (18.2%) patients. The overall response rate (ORR) was 85.6 % [28.5 % complete response (CR) and 57.1 % partial response (PR)] in the final response assessment during treatment with ibrutinib. Among other types of B-cell lymphoma, seven (33.4%) of the 21 patients were diagnosed with MCL, 5 (23.8%) with DLBCL, 4 (19.0%) with MZL, 3 (14.3%) with WM, and 2 (9.5%) with FL, upon follow-up. The median treatment duration was 4 months (range, 1?28) in this group. The most common adverse event was diarrhea: 8 (38.1%) patients. The ORR was 66.6% (20.0% CR and 46.6% PR) in the final response assessment during the treatment. Conclusion: Ibrutinib is a good treatment option for CLL and other B-cell lymphomas, with an acceptable side effect profile, and high and promising CR/PR response rates. Ibrutinib treatment at an early stage decreases the burden of cytotoxic therapy in fragile patients, thereby, increasing their quality of life.","['Gocer, Mesut', 'Kurtoglu, Erdal']","['Gocer M', 'Kurtoglu E']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', ""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Ibrutinib']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 05:51'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:51 [entrez]']","['br.2020.2020158 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2020.2020158 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2020 Dec 31;55(4):206-212. doi: 10.5045/br.2020.2020158.,,,"['Department of Hematology, Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.']",,,,,,PMC7784134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECAF is the receptor for alpha-fetoprotein, which is re-expressed on malignant cells, thus serving as a broad-spectrum tumor marker. Methods: The current study is a retrospective study carried out on 200 archival bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens [60 normal control (NC), 38 pathological control (PC) and 102 lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) specimens]. RECAF expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Results: The percentage of cells that are positive for RECAF was significantly higher in the LPD group than in the NC group (P=0.007), while there was no significant difference between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients and PC regarding the number of RECAF positive cells (P=0.1). RECAF showed a unique expression pattern among the different subtypes of LPD. None of the hairy cell leukemia (HCL) expressed RECAF, while the highest percentage was seen in follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (P=0.001). Compared to routine histopathology, RECAF was more sensitive in detecting bone marrow (BM) infiltration in FL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and DLBCL (P=0.01). Conclusion: RECAF is significantly expressed in the BM of NHL/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. RECAF shows a unique expression pattern among the different subtypes of LPD. Furthermore, RECAF may help to detect bone marrow infiltration in lymphoma cells. This may help in the diagnosis, follow-up, and targeting of LPD.","['Sedky, Hebatallah Adel', 'Youssef, Soha Raouf', 'Gamal, Doaa Ahmad', 'Houssein, Heba Fawzy', 'Elsalakawy, Walaa Ali']","['Sedky HA', 'Youssef SR', 'Gamal DA', 'Houssein HF', 'Elsalakawy WA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Diffuse large B cell lymphoma', 'Follicular lymphoma', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'RECAF']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 05:51'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:51 [entrez]']","['br.2020.2020070 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2020.2020070 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2020 Dec 31;55(4):253-261. doi: 10.5045/br.2020.2020070.,,,"['Clinical Pathology Department, Internal Medicine Department, Ain Shams University, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Internal Medicine Department, Ain Shams University, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Internal Medicine Department, Ain Shams University, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Internal Medicine Department, Ain Shams University, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Ain Shams University, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.']",,,,,,PMC7784125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proviral integration for the Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases are oncogenic serine/threonine kinases that regulate tumorigenesis by phosphorylating a wide range of substrates that control cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Because of their broad impact on cellular processes that facilitate progression and metastasis in many cancer types, it has become clear that the activation of PIM kinases is a significant driver of resistance to various types of anticancer therapies. As a result, efforts to target PIM kinases for anticancer therapy have intensified in recent years. Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of PIM has the potential to significantly improve the efficacy of standard and targeted therapies. This review focuses on the signaling pathways through which PIM kinases promote cancer progression and resistance to therapy, as well as highlights biological contexts and promising strategies to exploit PIM as a therapeutic target in cancer.","['Toth, Rachel K', 'Warfel, Noel A']","['Toth RK', 'Warfel NA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20201210,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2020/12/11 05:50'],"['2020/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:50 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-20-0535 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0535 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Jan;20(1):3-10. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0535.

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors provide an effective treatment for these diseases, they generally do not kill leukemic stem cells (LSCs), the cancer-initiating cells that compete with normal hematopoietic stem cells for the bone marrow niche. New strategies to target cancers driven by BCR-Abl are therefore urgently needed. We performed a small molecule screen based on competition between isogenic untransformed cells and BCR-Abl-transformed cells and identified several compounds that selectively impair the fitness of BCR-Abl-transformed cells. Interestingly, systems-level analysis of one of these novel compounds, DJ34, revealed that it induced depletion of c-Myc and activation of p53. DJ34-mediated c-Myc depletion occurred in a wide range of tumor cell types, including lymphoma, lung, glioblastoma, breast cancer, and several forms of leukemia, with primary LSCs being particularly sensitive to DJ34. Further analyses revealed that DJ34 interferes with c-Myc synthesis at the level of transcription, and we provide data showing that DJ34 is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. Physiologically, DJ34 induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cell differentiation. Taken together, we have identified a novel compound that dually targets c-Myc and p53 in a wide variety of cancers, and with particularly strong activity against LSCs.","['Tadele, Dagim Shiferaw', 'Robertson, Joseph', 'Crispin, Richard', 'Herrera, Maria C', 'Chlubnova, Marketa', 'Piechaczyk, Laure', 'Ayuda-Duran, Pilar', 'Singh, Sachin Kumar', 'Gedde-Dahl, Tobias', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Skavland, Jorn', 'Wesche, Jorgen', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn-Tore', 'Enserink, Jorrit M']","['Tadele DS', 'Robertson J', 'Crispin R', 'Herrera MC', 'Chlubnova M', 'Piechaczyk L', 'Ayuda-Duran P', 'Singh SK', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Floisand Y', 'Skavland J', 'Wesche J', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Enserink JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201217,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Abl', '*anticancer drug', '*c-Myc', '*drug screening', '*leukemia', '*mRNA', '*p53', '*phosphoproteomics', '*tyrosine kinase']",2020/12/12 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2020/12/11 05:50'],"['2020/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:50 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)00175-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA120.015285 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2021 Jan-Jun;296:100179. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA120.015285.

The long-term pulmonary sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are yet unknown, and comprehensive clinical follow-up data are lacking. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, observational study, we systematically evaluated the cardiopulmonary damage in subjects recovering from COVID-19 at 60 and 100 days after confirmed diagnosis. We conducted a detailed questionnaire, clinical examination, laboratory testing, lung function analysis, echocardiography and thoracic low-dose computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: Data from 145 COVID-19 patients were evaluated, and 41% of all subjects exhibited persistent symptoms 100 days after COVID-19 onset, with dyspnoea being most frequent (36%). Accordingly, patients still displayed an impaired lung function, with a reduced diffusing capacity in 21% of the cohort being the most prominent finding. Cardiac impairment, including a reduced left ventricular function or signs of pulmonary hypertension, was only present in a minority of subjects. CT scans unveiled persisting lung pathologies in 63% of patients, mainly consisting of bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or reticulation in the lower lung lobes, without radiological signs of pulmonary fibrosis. Sequential follow-up evaluations at 60 and 100 days after COVID-19 onset demonstrated a vast improvement of symptoms and CT abnormalities over time. CONCLUSION: A relevant percentage of post-COVID-19 patients presented with persisting symptoms and lung function impairment along with radiological pulmonary abnormalities >100 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, our results indicate a significant improvement in symptoms and cardiopulmonary status over time.","['Sonnweber, Thomas', 'Sahanic, Sabina', 'Pizzini, Alex', 'Luger, Anna', 'Schwabl, Christoph', 'Sonnweber, Bettina', 'Kurz, Katharina', 'Koppelstatter, Sabine', 'Haschka, David', 'Petzer, Verena', 'Boehm, Anna', 'Aichner, Magdalena', 'Tymoszuk, Piotr', 'Lener, Daniela', 'Theurl, Markus', 'Lorsbach-Kohler, Almut', 'Tancevski, Amra', 'Schapfl, Anna', 'Schaber, Marc', 'Hilbe, Richard', 'Nairz, Manfred', 'Puchner, Bernhard', 'Huttenberger, Doris', 'Tschurtschenthaler, Christoph', 'Asshoff, Malte', 'Peer, Andreas', 'Hartig, Frank', 'Bellmann, Romuald', 'Joannidis, Michael', 'Gollmann-Tepekoylu, Can', 'Holfeld, Johannes', 'Feuchtner, Gudrun', 'Egger, Alexander', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Schroll, Andrea', 'Fritsche, Gernot', 'Wildner, Sophie', 'Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa', 'Kirchmair, Rudolf', 'Helbok, Raimund', 'Prosch, Helmut', 'Rieder, Dietmar', 'Trajanoski, Zlatko', 'Kronenberg, Florian', 'Woll, Ewald', 'Weiss, Gunter', 'Widmann, Gerlig', 'Loffler-Ragg, Judith', 'Tancevski, Ivan']","['Sonnweber T', 'Sahanic S', 'Pizzini A', 'Luger A', 'Schwabl C', 'Sonnweber B', 'Kurz K', 'Koppelstatter S', 'Haschka D', 'Petzer V', 'Boehm A', 'Aichner M', 'Tymoszuk P', 'Lener D', 'Theurl M', 'Lorsbach-Kohler A', 'Tancevski A', 'Schapfl A', 'Schaber M', 'Hilbe R', 'Nairz M', 'Puchner B', 'Huttenberger D', 'Tschurtschenthaler C', 'Asshoff M', 'Peer A', 'Hartig F', 'Bellmann R', 'Joannidis M', 'Gollmann-Tepekoylu C', 'Holfeld J', 'Feuchtner G', 'Egger A', 'Hoermann G', 'Schroll A', 'Fritsche G', 'Wildner S', 'Bellmann-Weiler R', 'Kirchmair R', 'Helbok R', 'Prosch H', 'Rieder D', 'Trajanoski Z', 'Kronenberg F', 'Woll E', 'Weiss G', 'Widmann G', 'Loffler-Ragg J', 'Tancevski I']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5080-386X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3699-1822', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4958-9541', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7871-5354', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0398-6034', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3464-0343', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5116-8960', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6584-3488', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6755-4399', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6119-6364', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0709-2158', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5116-8960']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210429,England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,IM,,,2020/12/12 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/11 05:50'],"['2020/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:50 [entrez]']","['13993003.03481-2020 [pii]', '10.1183/13993003.03481-2020 [doi]']",epublish,Eur Respir J. 2021 Apr 29;57(4). pii: 13993003.03481-2020. doi: 10.1183/13993003.03481-2020.

However, the role of ALKBH2 in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanism of ALKBH2 and its function in CRC. METHODS: The expression levels of ALKBH2 in CRC tissues and cells were determined by qRT-PCR. Following that, the role of ALKBH2 in cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC cells (Caco-2 and LOVO) were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell assays, and Western blotting, respectively. The effect of ALKBH2 on B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) and downstream NF-kappaB pathway was determined by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: The expression of ALKBH2 was significantly upregulated both in CRC tissues and cells. Further experiments demonstrated that reduction of ALKBH2 suppressed Caco-2 and LOVO cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, ALKBH2 knockdown also suppressed EMT, which increased E-cadherin expression and reduced N-cadherin expression. Besides, ALKBH2 silencing inhibited BMI1 expression and reduced nuclear accumulation of the NF-kappaB p65 protein, as well as the luciferase activity of NF-kappaB p65. Upregulation of BMI1 reversed the effect of ALKBH2 knockdown on the proliferation and invasion in CRC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that suppression of ALKBH2 alleviates malignancy in CRC by regulating BMI1-mediated activation of NF-kappaB pathway. ALKBH2 may serve as a potential treatment target for human CRC.","['Ke, Bingxin', 'Ye, Kejun', 'Cheng, Shaobing']","['Ke B', 'Ye K', 'Cheng S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4279-3195'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase', 'B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1', 'Colorectal carcinoma', 'NF-kappaB pathway', 'alkB homolog 2']",2020/12/12 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/11 05:35'],"['2020/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 05:35 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12957-020-02106-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12957-020-02106-0 [pii]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2020 Dec 10;18(1):328. doi: 10.1186/s12957-020-02106-0.,20210514,,"['Department of Colorectal Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, No. 79, Qingchun Road, Xiacheng District, Hangzhou City, 310003, Zhejiang Province, China. 1514012@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Colorectal Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, No. 79, Qingchun Road, Xiacheng District, Hangzhou City, 310003, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Colorectal Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, No. 79, Qingchun Road, Xiacheng District, Hangzhou City, 310003, Zhejiang Province, China.']","['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.11.33 (ALKBH2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.33 (AlkB Homolog 2, Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']","['AlkB Homolog 2, Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",,,,PMC7731553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CML is a relatively rare disease, mainly affecting elderly patients, but the prevalence of CML is expected to increase dramatically. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have changed the CML patients' treatment patterns and improved its treatment effect, but drug resistance still remains a significant problem to be solved. Therefore, the identification of biomarkers of CML resistance involved therein is essential for treatment and prognosis prediction. METHODS: Bioinformatics was used to analyze and construct a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network of CML resistance to dasatinib and predict key lncRNAs. RESULTS: By screening differentially expressed genes in CML resistant to dasatinib and comprehensively analyzing their functions and signal pathways, the core genes in these differential genes were found, and by predictive analysis of the upstream targets of these core genes. Finally, a network diagram containing lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA was constructed. CONCLUSIONS: MALAT1 as a lncRNA may be a tumor suppressor in patients with CML. According to our data, MALAT1 may have potential role as a molecular biomarker for the occurrence and development of CML resistance to dasatinib.","['Luo, Jiawen', 'Gao, Yin', 'Lin, Xiaomin', 'Guan, Xiaoying']","['Luo J', 'Gao Y', 'Lin X', 'Guan X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201202,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'MALAT1', 'dasatinib resistance', 'lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network']",2020/12/12 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/11 05:33'],"['2020/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:33 [entrez]']","['10.21037/apm-20-343 [doi]', 'apm-20-343 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2021 Feb;10(2):1727-1738. doi: 10.21037/apm-20-343.

The rapid growth of unusual lymphocyte cells leads to bone marrow failure, which may slow down the production of new blood cells, and hence increases patient morbidity and mortality. Age is a crucial clinical factor in leukemia diagnosis, since if leukemia is diagnosed in the early stages, it is highly curable. Incidence is increasing globally, as around 412,000 people worldwide are likely to be diagnosed with some type of leukemia, of which acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for approximately 12% of all leukemia cases worldwide. Thus, the reliable and accurate detection of normal and malignant cells is of major interest. Automatic detection with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) models can assist medics, and can be beneficial for the early detection of leukemia. In this paper, a single center study, we aimed to build an aggregated deep learning model for Leukemic B-lymphoblast classification. To make a reliable and accurate deep learner, data augmentation techniques were applied to tackle the limited dataset size, and a transfer learning strategy was employed to accelerate the learning process, and further improve the performance of the proposed network. The results show that our proposed approach was able to fuse features extracted from the best deep learning models, and outperformed individual networks with a test accuracy of 96.58% in Leukemic B-lymphoblast diagnosis.","['Kasani, Payam Hosseinzadeh', 'Park, Sang-Won', 'Jang, Jae-Won']","['Kasani PH', 'Park SW', 'Jang JW']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3612-4665', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9796-2799', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3540-530X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201208,Switzerland,Diagnostics (Basel),"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",101658402,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'computer-aided diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'transfer learning']",2020/12/12 06:00,2020/12/12 06:01,['2020/12/11 01:01'],"['2020/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/12 06:01 [medline]']","['diagnostics10121064 [pii]', '10.3390/diagnostics10121064 [doi]']",epublish,Diagnostics (Basel). 2020 Dec 8;10(12). pii: diagnostics10121064. doi: 10.3390/diagnostics10121064.,,,"['Department of Neurology, Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon 24289, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Bigdata Convergence, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24289, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon 24289, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Bigdata Convergence, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24289, Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon 24289, Korea.', 'College of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24289, Korea.']",,,,,,PMC7763941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated idasanutlin-a new, potent murine double minute 2 antagonist-alone or with cytarabine in patients with r/r acute myeloid leukemia, de novo untreated acute myeloid leukemia unsuitable for standard treatment or with adverse features, or secondary acute myeloid leukemia in a multicenter, open-label, phase 1/1b trial. Primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) and characterize the safety profile of idasanutlin monotherapy and combination therapy. Clinical activity and pharmacokinetics were secondary objectives. Two idasanutlin formulations were investigated: a microprecipitate bulk powder (MBP) and optimized spray-dried powder (SDP). Following dose escalation, patients (N = 122) received idasanutlin at the RDE in the extension cohorts. No formal MTD was identified. Idasanutlin was tolerable alone and in combination with cytarabine. The RDE was determined as 600 mg twice a day for the MBP formulation and 300 mg twice a day for the SDP formulation. Adverse events were mostly grade 1/2 (76.2 %). The most common any-grade adverse events were gastrointestinal (including diarrhea [90.2 %]). The early death rate across all patients was 14.8 %. Plasma idasanutlin exposure was dose related. In TP53 wild-type patients, composite complete remission rates were 18.9 % with monotherapy and 35.6 % with combination therapy. Based on these results, idasanutlin development continued with further investigation in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

The acceleration of the proliferative activity of epithelial stem/progenitor cells is involved in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. Recently, the use of a menin-mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) inhibitor, MI503, in experiments has resulted in inhibition of the growth of tumors under histone modification. In this study, we investigated the effects of the menin-MLL inhibitor against cholesteatoma growth in an in vivo model. METHODS: We first correlated the expression level of histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) among cholesteatoma cases, chronic otitis media cases and normal skin tissues. Based on the role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in the development of cholesteatoma, KGF-expression vector was transfected into the ear and we analyzed the expression level of H3K4me3. After cholesteatoma was induced, MI503 was administered daily into the ear for 14 days. RESULTS: We detected the highest labeling index of H3K4me3 in the cholesteatoma specimens. After KGF-expression vector transfection in the mouse ear, a high expression level of H3K4me3 was observed in the epithelial layers. The use of MI503 reduced cholesteatoma in the in vivo model and decreased the proliferation of epithelial stem/progenitor cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction may be a potentially useful strategy in the conservative treatment of cholesteatoma.","['Yamamoto-Fukuda, Tomomi', 'Akiyama, Naotaro', 'Tatsumi, Norifumi', 'Okabe, Masataka', 'Kojima, Hiromi']","['Yamamoto-Fukuda T', 'Akiyama N', 'Tatsumi N', 'Okabe M', 'Kojima H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201203,Ireland,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,8003603,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Cholesteatoma', 'KGF', 'Level of evidence: N/A', 'Menin-MLL inhibitor', 'p63']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/10 20:10'],"['2020/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 20:10 [entrez]']","['S0165-5876(20)30688-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110545 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2021 Jan;140:110545. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110545.

Natural killer (NK) cells play important roles in the immune surveillance and elimination of tumor cells. Although accumulating evidence has indicated that arsenic has immunosuppressive properties, little is known about the effects of arsenic on the tumoricidal functions of NK cells. We examined the effects of arsenite on the cytotoxic activities of human and mouse NK cells toward target tumor cells. Exposure of human NK-92 cells and primary mouse NK cells to sublethal doses of arsenite reduced the IL-2-activated cytotoxic activities toward human K562 cells and murine YAC-1 cells, respectively. NK cells recognize target cells via integrated signals from both activating and inhibitory receptors and induce apoptosis of target cells via a granzyme/perforin system. We found that exposure of NK-92 cells to arsenite diminished the IL-2-activated down-regulation of the inhibitory receptors, KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3, and the up-regulation of granzyme B and lymphotoxin-alpha. The IL-2-activated increases in secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-10 were also slightly reduced by arsenite. Thus, arsenite suppressed the IL-2-activated cytotoxic activity of NK cells by disrupting multiple pathways required for the recognition and killing of target tumor cells. Our findings provide new insights into the roles of NK cell-mediated tumor immunity in cancer development by arsenic.","['Sumi, Daigo', 'Tsuyama, Hiromasa', 'Ogawa, Tomoko', 'Ogawa, Masatoshi', 'Himeno, Seiichiro']","['Sumi D', 'Tsuyama H', 'Ogawa T', 'Ogawa M', 'Himeno S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201208,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arsenic', '*Carcinogenesis', '*Granzyme', '*Inhibitory receptor', '*Natural killer cell', '*Tumor immunity', '*Tumoricidal activity']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/05/12 06:00,['2020/12/10 20:09'],"['2020/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 20:09 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(20)30475-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2020.115353 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2021 Feb 1;412:115353. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2020.115353.

METHODS: We reviewed outcomes after alloHCT relapse, with or without use of these newer agents for ALL, AML, and MDS. In total, 115 adults with relapsed or refractory ALL (n = 17), AML (n = 67), and MDS (n = 31) at median 5 (range, 1-64) months after their first alloHCT in 2010-2018 were included. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 19 (range, 6-80) months after relapse from alloHCT. Targeted agents were given to 29 (25%) patients. In multivariable analysis, use of targeted agent at any time point after relapse was not associated with survival. Matched unrelated (vs. matched sibling; hazard ratio [HR] 1.70; p = .027) or haploidentical donor grafts (vs. matched sibling; HR 2.69; p = .003), presence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease before relapse (HR 2.46; p < .001), and less than 12 months from HCT to relapse (<6 vs. > 12 months; HR 6.34; p < .001; 6-12 vs. > 12 months; HR 3.16; p = .005) were adverse prognostic factors for post-relapse survival. CONCLUSION: Outcomes after alloHCT relapse remain poor regardless of the novel agent use. Innovative treatment strategies are needed to improve outcomes after relapse post-alloHCT.","['Hong, Sanghee', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Corrigan, Donna', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Gerds, Aaron T', 'Dean, Rob M', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Jagadeesh, Deepa', 'Anwer, Faiz', 'Majhail, Navneet S']","['Hong S', 'Rybicki L', 'Corrigan D', 'Hamilton BK', 'Sobecks R', 'Kalaycio M', 'Gerds AT', 'Dean RM', 'Hill BT', 'Pohlman B', 'Jagadeesh D', 'Anwer F', 'Majhail NS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201205,England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'Post-transplant relapse', 'Relapse', 'Survival']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:00,['2020/12/10 20:08'],"['2020/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 20:08 [entrez]']","['S1658-3876(20)30178-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2021 Dec;14(4):318-326. doi: 10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.11.006.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 312 patients with aggressive ATL and analyzed the effect of chemotherapy dose intensity on prognosis in clinical practice. RESULT: As first-line therapy, 62 patients underwent best supportive care (BSC) or single-agent chemotherapy, and 235 underwent intensive chemotherapy. The median survival time (MST) was 0.58 years in the 312 total patients, and 0.13 years and 0.75 years in the BSC/single-agent chemotherapy group and intensive chemotherapy group, respectively. The median average relative dose intensity (ARDI) of patients who received intensive chemotherapy was 60%. We divided patients into 3 groups according to ARDI. Those in the top tertile of ARDI (ARDI >/= 75%, n = 82) had better overall survival compared with those in the intermediate tertile (45% </= ARDI < 75%, n = 79) (P < .0001), with MSTs of 4.69 and 0.75 years, respectively. The occurrence of organ dysfunction and infectious complications was comparable between the two ARDI groups. CONCLUSION: Higher ARDI improves prognosis in patients with aggressive ATL in clinical practice.","['Sekine, Masaaki', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Shide, Kotaro', 'Maeda, Kouichi', 'Toyama, Takanori', 'Kawano, Noriaki', 'Takeuchi, Masanori', 'Kawano, Hiroshi', 'Sato, Seiichi', 'Ishizaki, Junzo', 'Kukita, Toshimasa', 'Kamiunten, Ayako', 'Akizuki, Keiichi', 'Tahira, Yuki', 'Shimoda, Haruko', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Matsuoka, Hitoshi', 'Kitanaka, Akira', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Sekine M', 'Kameda T', 'Shide K', 'Maeda K', 'Toyama T', 'Kawano N', 'Takeuchi M', 'Kawano H', 'Sato S', 'Ishizaki J', 'Kukita T', 'Kamiunten A', 'Akizuki K', 'Tahira Y', 'Shimoda H', 'Hidaka T', 'Yamashita K', 'Matsuoka H', 'Kitanaka A', 'Kubuki Y', 'Shimoda K']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5481-3451'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201219,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'chemotherapy', 'dose intensity', 'outcomes research']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/12/10 17:13'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13565 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Mar;106(3):398-407. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13565.

Here, we showed that ATP levels were markedly increased in the bone marrow niches of mice with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and LICs preferentially localized to the endosteal niche with relatively high ATP levels, as indicated by a sensitive ATP indicator. ATP could efficiently induce the influx of ions into LICs in an MLL-AF9-induced murine AML model via the ligand-gated ion channel P2X7. P2x7 deletion led to notably impaired homing and self-renewal capacities of LICs and contributed to an approximately 5-fold decrease in the number of functional LICs but had no effect on normal hematopoiesis. ATP/P2X7 signaling enhanced the calcium flux-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, which further transactivated phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) expression to maintain serine metabolism and LIC fates. P2X7 knockdown resulted in a markedly extended survival of recipients transplanted with either human AML cell lines or primary leukemia cells. Blockade of ATP/P2X7 signaling could efficiently inhibit leukemogenesis. Here, we provide a perspective for understanding how ATP/P2X7 signaling sustains LIC activities, which may benefit the development of specific strategies for targeting LICs or other types of cancer stem cells.","['He, Xiaoxiao', 'Wan, Jiangbo', 'Yang, Xiaona', 'Zhang, Xiuze', 'Huang, Dan', 'Li, Xie', 'Zou, Yejun', 'Chen, Chiqi', 'Yu, Zhuo', 'Xie, Li', 'Zhang, Yaping', 'Liu, Ligen', 'Li,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have retrospectively analyzed an electronic database of patients aged 0-17 years who underwent inpatient treatment of congenital heart disease at the Federal Center for Cardiovascular Surgery for the period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018. Incidence of Down's syndrome in children with congenital heart defects was 5.36% of the total number of children with congenital heart defects. No gender differences were identified. The most common congenital heart defects were ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot. Down's syndrome and congenital heart disease were diagnosed prenatally in 33 out of 319 patients. A rare case of Down's syndrome combined with congenital heart disease and acute leukemia is described. Treatment outcome was unfavorable. CONCLUSION. S: Evere concomitant diseases in a child with Down's syndrome determine high postoperative morbidity and mortality. Prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome via screening of pregnant women for ultrasound and biochemical markers of this pathology is required.","['Petrova, O V', 'Murygina, O I', 'Shashin, S A', 'Nikulina, D M', 'Tarasov, D G']","['Petrova OV', 'Murygina OI', 'Shashin SA', 'Nikulina DM', 'Tarasov DG']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3544-2266', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0359-8664', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1296-2031', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7401-8671', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6065-2487']",['rus'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Khirurgiia (Mosk),Khirurgiia,0412765,IM,['NOTNLM'],"[""Down's syndrome"", 'acute leukemia', 'children of the first year of life', 'congenital heart disease']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/12/10 12:38'],"['2020/12/10 12:38 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17116/hirurgia2020121111 [doi]'],ppublish,Khirurgiia (Mosk). 2020;(12):111-114. doi: 10.17116/hirurgia2020121111.,20201221,,"['Federal Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, Astrakhan, Russia.', 'Astrakhan State Medical University, Astrakhan, Russia.', 'Federal Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, Astrakhan, Russia.', 'Astrakhan State Medical University, Astrakhan, Russia.', 'Astrakhan State Medical University, Astrakhan, Russia.', 'Federal Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, Astrakhan, Russia.', 'Astrakhan State Medical University, Astrakhan, Russia.']",,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Down Syndrome/complications', '*Heart Defects, Congenital/complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,Sluchai sindroma Dauna s vrozhdennym ostrym leikozom i vrozhdennym porokom serdtsa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, nucleophosmin 1 muted acute myeloid leukemia (NPM1+ AML) can mimic APL, especially the hypogranular variant of APL. Our study aimed to develop a novel, Radar plot-based FCM strategy to distinguish APLs and NPM1+ AMLs quickly and accurately. METHOD: Diagnostic samples from 52 APL and 32 NPM1+ AMLs patients were analyzed by a 3-tube panel of 10-color FCM. Radar plots combining all markers were constructed for each tube. Percentages of positive leukemic cells and mean fluorescence intensity were calculated for all the markers. RESULTS: APL showed significantly higher expression of CD64, CD2, and CD13, whereas more leukemic cells were positive for CD11b, CD11c, CD15, CD36, and HLA-DR in NPM1+ AMLs. Radar plots featured CD2 expression, a lack of a monocytic component, lack of expression of HLA-DR and CD15, and a lack of a prominent CD11c+ population as recurring characteristics of APL. The presence of blasts with low SSC, presence of at least some monocytes, some expression of HLA-DR and/or CD15, and a prominent CD11c population were recurrent characteristics of NPM1+ AMLs. Radar plot analysis could confidently separate all hypergranular APL cases from any NPM1+ AML and in 90% of cases between variant APL and blastic NPM1+ AML. CONCLUSION: Radar plots can potentially add to differential diagnostics as they exhibit characteristic patterns distinguishing APL and different types of NPM1+ AMLs.","['Gupta, Monali', 'Jafari, Katayoon', 'Rajab, Amr', 'Wei, Cuihong', 'Mazur, Joanna', 'Tierens, Anne', 'Hyjek, Elizabeth', 'Musani, Rumina', 'Porwit, Anna']","['Gupta M', 'Jafari K', 'Rajab A', 'Wei C', 'Mazur J', 'Tierens A', 'Hyjek E', 'Musani R', 'Porwit A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0709-2713'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201210,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Differentiation stage and immune-effector functions of the underlying tumor cell are insufficiently characterized. Constitutive activation of the T-cell leukemia 1A (TCL1A) oncogene distinguishes the (pre)leukemic cell from regular postthymic T cells. We assessed activation-response patterns of the T-PLL lymphocyte and interrogated the modulatory impact by TCL1A. Immunophenotypic and gene expression profiles revealed a unique spectrum of memory-type differentiation of T-PLL with predominant central-memory stages and frequent noncanonical patterns. Virtually all T-PLL expressed a T-cell receptor (TCR) and/or CD28-coreceptor without overrepresentation of specific TCR clonotypes. The highly activated leukemic cells also revealed losses of negative-regulatory TCR coreceptors (eg, CTLA4). TCR stimulation of T-PLL cells evoked higher-than-normal cell-cycle transition and profiles of cytokine release that resembled those of normal memory T cells. More activated phenotypes and higher TCL1A correlated with inferior clinical outcomes. TCL1A was linked to the marked resistance of T-PLL to activation- and FAS-induced cell death. Enforced TCL1A enhanced phospho-activation of TCR kinases, second-messenger generation, and JAK/STAT or NFAT transcriptional responses. This reduced the input thresholds for IL-2 secretion in a sensitizer-like fashion. Mice of TCL1A-initiated protracted T-PLL development resembled such features. When equipped with epitope-defined TCRs or chimeric antigen receptors, these Lckpr-hTCL1Atg T cells gained a leukemogenic growth advantage in scenarios of receptor stimulation. Overall, we propose a model of T-PLL pathogenesis in which TCL1A enhances TCR signals and drives the accumulation of death-resistant memory-type cells that use amplified low-level stimulatory input, and whose loss of negative coregulators additionally maintains their activated state. Treatment rationales are provided by combined interception in TCR and survival signaling.","['Oberbeck, S', 'Schrader, A', 'Warner, K', 'Jungherz, D', 'Crispatzu, G', 'von Jan, J', 'Chmielewski, M',

Recent evidence suggests that the microenvironment may play an important role in modulating human AML population dynamics. To investigate this concept further, we examined the combined and separate effects of an oncogene (c-MYC) and exposure to interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and stem cell factor (SCF) on the experimental genesis of a human AML in xenografted immunodeficient mice. Initial experiments showed that normal human CD34+ blood cells transduced with a lentiviral MYC vector and then transplanted into immunodeficient mice produced a hierarchically organized, rapidly fatal, and serially transplantable blast population, phenotypically and transcriptionally similar to human AML cells, but only in mice producing IL-3, GM-CSF, and SCF transgenically or in regular mice in which the cells were exposed to IL-3 or GM-CSF delivered using a cotransduction strategy. In their absence, the MYC+ human cells produced a normal repertoire of lymphoid and myeloid progeny in transplanted mice for many months, but, on transfer to secondary mice producing the human cytokines, the MYC+ cells rapidly generated AML. Indistinguishable diseases were also obtained efficiently from both primitive (CD34+CD38-) and late granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) cells. These findings underscore the critical role that these cytokines can play in activating a malignant state in normally differentiating human hematopoietic cells in which MYC expression has been deregulated. They also introduce a robust experimental model of human leukemogenesis to further elucidate key mechanisms involved and test strategies to suppress them.","['Bulaeva, Elizabeth', 'Pellacani, Davide', 'Nakamichi, Naoto', 'Hammond, Colin A', 'Beer, Philip A', 'Lorzadeh, Alireza', 'Moksa, Michelle', 'Carles, Annaick', 'Bilenky, Misha', 'Lefort, Sylvain', 'Shu, Jeremy', 'Wilhelm, Brian T', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Hirst, Martin', 'Eaves, Connie J']","['Bulaeva E', 'Pellacani D', 'Nakamichi N', 'Hammond CA', 'Beer PA', 'Lorzadeh A', 'Moksa M', 'Carles A', 'Bilenky M', 'Lefort S', 'Shu J', 'Wilhelm BT', 'Weng AP', 'Hirst M', 'Eaves CJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/12/10 12:16'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 12:16 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)72810-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020006374 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Dec 10;136(24):2764-2773. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020006374.,20210406,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; and.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']","['0 (CSF2 protein, human)', '0 (IL3 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism']",,,"['EP1-120589/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'CEE-151619/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, limited data are available on the risk, racial disparity, and outcomes for COVID-19 illness in patients with cancer. Objectives: To investigate how patients with specific types of cancer are at risk for COVID-19 infection and its adverse outcomes and whether there are cancer-specific race disparities for COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control analysis of patient electronic health records included 73.4 million patients from 360 hospitals and 317000 clinicians across 50 US states to August 14, 2020. The odds of COVID-19 infections for 13 common cancer types and adverse outcomes were assessed. Exposures: The exposure groups were patients diagnosed with a specific cancer, whereas the unexposed groups were patients without the specific cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for the risk of COVID-19 infection. Results: Among the 73.4 million patients included in the analysis (53.6% female), 2523920 had at least 1 of the 13 common cancers diagnosed (all cancer diagnosed within or before the last year), and 273140 had recent cancer (cancer diagnosed within the last year). Among 16570 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 1200 had a cancer diagnosis and 690 had a recent cancer diagnosis of at least 1 of the 13 common cancers. Those with recent cancer diagnosis were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection (aOR, 7.14 [95% CI, 6.91-7.39]; P < .001), with the strongest association for recently diagnosed leukemia (aOR, 12.16 [95% CI, 11.03-13.40]; P < .001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 8.54 [95% CI, 7.80-9.36]; P < .001), and lung cancer (aOR, 7.66 [95% CI, 7.07-8.29]; P < .001) and weakest for thyroid cancer (aOR, 3.10 [95% CI, 2.47-3.87]; P < .001). Among patients with recent cancer diagnosis, African Americans had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 infection than White patients; this racial disparity was largest for breast cancer (aOR, 5.44 [95% CI, 4.69-6.31]; P < .001), followed by prostate cancer (aOR, 5.10 [95% CI, 4.34-5.98]; P < .001), colorectal cancer (aOR, 3.30 [95% CI, 2.55-4.26]; P < .001), and lung cancer (aOR, 2.53 [95% CI, 2.10-3.06]; P < .001). Patients with cancer and COVID-19 had significantly worse outcomes (hospitalization, 47.46%; death, 14.93%) than patients with COVID-19 without cancer (hospitalization, 24.26%; death, 5.26%) (P < .001) and patients with cancer without COVID-19 (hospitalization, 12.39%; death, 4.03%) (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, patients with cancer were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes, which was further exacerbated among African Americans. These findings highlight the need to protect and monitor patients with cancer as part of the strategy to control the pandemic.","['Wang, QuanQiu', 'Berger, Nathan A', 'Xu, Rong']","['Wang Q', 'Berger NA', 'Xu R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/12/10 12:15'],"['2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 12:15 [entrez]']","['2773500 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.6178 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2021 Feb 1;7(2):220-227. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.6178.,20210225,,"['Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Center for Science, Health, and Society, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.']",,"['Adult', 'African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'COVID-19/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",,,"['R01 AG057557/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002548/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 HD084068/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AG062272/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY029297/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7729584,,,,,,,,"['JAMA Oncol. 2021 Feb 1;7(2):227-229.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 15 cohorts of patients published in 7 clinical trials. The restricted mean survival time (RMST) was used for analyzing survival curves, performing the comparisons and ranking the treatments based on their effectiveness. The endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: 15 patient cohorts receiving 11 different first-line treatments were studied. Overall, all of the newest treatments had a positive effect on PFS compared with the old standards. As compared with chlorambucil monotherapy, the improvement in PFS resulting from targeted therapies ranged from 5.4 to 7.3 months per patient. Excluding chlorambucil alone or combined with obinutuzumab, the remaining 11 targeted treatments showed nearly identical values of PFS. Numerically but not statistically, ibrutinib plus venetoclax was associated with the longest PFS. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were calculated to better interpret these results. CONCLUSION: Our results provide an updated overview of the efficacy of the newest first-line treatments for CLL. Our findings confirm the good performance of RMST in this type of analyses.","['Bartoli, Laura', 'Ferracane, Elisa', 'Trippoli, Sabrina', 'Messori, Andrea']","['Bartoli L', 'Ferracane E', 'Trippoli S', 'Messori A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/12/10 12:09'],"['2021/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 12:09 [entrez]']","['187523 [pii]', '10.5414/CP203852 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2021 Apr;59(4):322-327. doi: 10.5414/CP203852.,20210414,,,"['0 (Pyrazoles)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regrettably, it remains far from optimal medicine due to insurmountable drug resistance and side effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has proven that it can induce systemic immune responses. However, conventional photosensitizers as immunomodulators produce anticancer immunities, which are inadequate to eliminate residual cancer cells. Herein, a novel compound 4 was synthesized and investigated, which introduces dasatinib and zinc(II) phthalocyanine as the targeting and photodynamic moiety, respectively. Compound 4 exhibits a high affinity to CCRF-CEM cells/tumor tissues, which overexpress lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), and preferential elimination from the body. Meanwhile, compound 4 shows excellent photocytotoxicity and tumor regression. Significantly, compound 4-induced PDT can obviously enhance immune responses, resulting in the production of more immune cells. We believe that the proposed manner is a potential strategy for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Yuan, Gankun', 'Yao, Mengyu', 'Lv, Huihui', 'Jia, Xiao', 'Chen, Juanjuan', 'Xue, Jinping']","['Yuan G', 'Yao M', 'Lv H', 'Jia X', 'Chen J', 'Xue J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9148-2206', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6952-0475']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201210,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/12/10 12:08'],"['2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 12:08 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01072 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2020 Dec 24;63(24):15655-15667. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01072.

However, the high level of structural conservation among the members of the PI3K family and the diverse physiological roles of Class I PI3K isoforms (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma) highlight the importance of isoform selectivity in the development of PI3Kgamma inhibitors. In this review, we provide an overview of the structural features of PI3Kgamma that influence gamma-isoform selectivity and discuss the structure-selectivity-activity relationship of existing clinical PI3Kgamma inhibitors. Additionally, we summarize the experimental and computational techniques utilized to identify PI3Kgamma inhibitors.

Clearance of defective mitochondria involves fission and ubiquitin-dependent degradation via mitophagy to maintain energy homeostasis. We hypothesize that LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) mutation disrupts mitochondrial turnover causing accumulation of defective mitochondria in aging brain. We found more ubiquitinated mitochondria with aberrant morphology associated with impaired function in aged (but not young) LRRK2(R1441G) knockin mutant mouse striatum compared to wild-type (WT) controls. LRRK2(R1441G) mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited reduced MAP1LC3/LC3 activation indicating impaired macroautophagy/autophagy. Mutant MEFs under FCCP-induced (mitochondrial uncoupler) stress showed increased LC3-aggregates demonstrating impaired mitophagy. Using a novel flow cytometry assay to quantify mitophagic rates in MEFs expressing photoactivatable mito-PAmCherry, we found significantly slower mitochondria clearance in mutant cells. Specific LRRK2 kinase inhibition using GNE-7915 did not alleviate impaired mitochondrial clearance suggesting a lack of direct relationship to increased kinase activity alone. DNM1L/Drp1 knockdown in MEFs slowed mitochondrial clearance indicating that DNM1L is a prerequisite for mitophagy. DNM1L knockdown in slowing mitochondrial clearance was less pronounced in mutant MEFs, indicating preexisting impaired DNM1L activation. DNM1L knockdown disrupted mitochondrial network which was more evident in mutant MEFs. DNM1L-Ser616 and MAPK/ERK phosphorylation which mediate mitochondrial fission and downstream mitophagic processes was apparent in WT using FCCP-induced stress but not mutant MEFs, despite similar total MAPK/ERK and DNM1L levels. In conclusion, aberrant mitochondria morphology and dysfunction associated with impaired mitophagy and DNM1L-MAPK/ERK signaling are found in mutant LRRK2 MEFs and mouse brain.Abbreviations: ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BAX: BCL2-associated X protein; CDK1: cyclin-dependent kinase 1; CDK5: cyclin-dependent kinase 5; CQ: chloroquine; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; DNM1L/DRP1: dynamin 1-like; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FCCP: carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; LAMP2A: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A; LRRK2: leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAPK1/ERK2: mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; MFN1: mitofusin 1; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; PAmCherry: photoactivatable-mCherry; PD: Parkinson disease; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; PRKN/PARKIN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RAB10: RAB10, member RAS oncogene family; RAF: v-raf-leukemia oncogene; SNCA: synuclein, alpha; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; VDAC: voltage-dependent anion channel; WT: wild type; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1.","['Liu, Huifang', 'Ho, Philip Wing-Lok', 'Leung, Chi-Ting', 'Pang, Shirley Yin-Yu', 'Chang, Eunice Eun Seo', 'Choi, Zoe Yuen-Kiu', 'Kung, Michelle Hiu-Wai', 'Ramsden, David Boyer', 'Ho, Shu-Leong']","['Liu H', 'Ho PW', 'Leung CT', 'Pang SY', 'Chang EES', 'Choi ZY', 'Kung MH', 'Ramsden DB', 'Ho SL']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7794-0146', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0927-1304']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201210,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aging', '*Dnm1l/DRP1', '*SQSTM1/p62', '*knockin mice', '*macroautophagy', '*mitochondria dysfunction', '*mitochondrial fission', '*mitophagy', '*parkinson disease', '*ubiquitination']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:00,['2020/12/10 08:38'],"['2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 08:38 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2020.1850008 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2021 Oct;17(10):3196-3220. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2020.1850008.

Given the global tendency for performing quick and noninvasive tests for embryo selection, great efforts have been made to discover the predictive biomarkers of embryo implantation potential.

Previous studies have evaluated cytokines, miRNAs, extracellular vesicles, and other factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor, colony-stimulating factor, reactive oxygen species, soluble human leukocyte antigen G, amino acids, and apolipoproteins in these media.

Understanding of the molecular pathogenesis may lead to novel therapeutic targets. Rapamycin, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, showed inhibitory effects on T-ALL cells. In this study, we showed that rapamycin significantly reduced MYCN mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner in T-ALL cells. Selective knockdown of MYCN by small interfering RNA had similar effects to rapamycin to inhibit T-ALL proliferation and colony formation and to induce G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. The inhibitory effects of rapamycin and MYCN depletion were also found in a Molt-4 xenograft model. Rapamycin and MYCN inhibition suppressed both Wnt/beta-catenin and mTOR signaling pathways. The results suggest the effects of rapamycin on adult T-ALL is likely mediated by downregulation of MYCN. The findings suggest MYCN a potential target for the treatment of adult T-ALL. Additionally, dual targeting of mTOR and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways may represent a novel strategy in the treatment of adult T-ALL.","['Kong, Desheng', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Sun, Lili', 'Chen, Xi', 'Zhao, Yanqiu', 'Zhao, Linlin', 'Guo, Zhibo', 'Li, Yinghua']","['Kong D', 'Fan S', 'Sun L', 'Chen X', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhao L', 'Guo Z', 'Li Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8060-8221'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201223,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['MYCN', 'Wnt/beta-catenin', 'adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'mTOR', 'rapamycin']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/12/10 06:00'],"['2020/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2831 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr;39(2):222-230. doi: 10.1002/hon.2831.

SNHG14 expression was measured via RTqPCR in bone marrow tissues from 57 patients with AML and 57 healthy donors. The clinicopathological features of AML patients with low and high SNHG14 expression were analysed. AML cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using MTT and flow cytometry analyses. The starBase online database, and RNAbinding protein immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase reporter gene assays were employed to analyse the interactions among SNHG14, microRNA (miR)193b3p and MCL1 apoptosis regulator BCL2 family member (MCL1). SNHG14 was found to be overexpressed in the bone marrow tissues of patients with AML. The FrenchAmericanBritish classification and cytogenetics were significantly different between patients with high and low expression of SNHG14. Silencing SNHG14 decreased AML cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis. SNHG14 functioned as a sponge for miR193b3p, and miR193b3p decreased the viability and accelerated the apoptosis rate of AML cells. In addition, miR193b3p targeted MCL1. Furthermore, silencing SNHG14 resulted in the sponging of miR193b3p to regulate cell viability, apoptosis, and MCL1 expression in AML. SNHG14 silencing decreased the viability and promoted apoptosis of AML cells by modulating the miR193b3p/MCL1 axis.","['Wang, Xiaoliang', 'Li, Wenrong', 'Chen, Yanhong', 'Zhou, Lijuan']","['Wang X', 'Li W', 'Chen Y', 'Zhou L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*small nucleolar RNA host gene 14', '*microRNA193b3p', '*apoptosis', '*MCL1 apoptosis regulator BCL2 family member']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:59'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:59 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2020.11729 [doi]', '90 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Feb;23(2). pii: 90. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2020.11729.

The levels of lncRNA ANRIL were increased in patients with AML compared with those in healthy donors and were capable of distinguishing patients with AML from healthy donors (area under the curve, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.8200.952). Furthermore, lncRNA ANRIL was associated with an increased occurrence internal tandem duplications in the FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3, decreased occurrence inv(16) or t(16;6), intermediaterisk and poorrisk stratification while no association of lncRNA ANRIL was identified with FrenchAmericanBritish classification, cytogenetics, isolated biallelic CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein alpha mutation and nucleophosmin 1 mutation in patients with AML. Furthermore, lncRNA ANRIL was significantly associated with a lower CR rate. In addition, EFS and OS were shorter in patients with high expression of lncRNA ANRIL compared with those in patients with low expression of lncRNA ANRIL. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that high expression of lncRNA ANRIL, poorrisk stratification and white blood cells (>10.0x10(9) cells/l) were independent prognostic factors for shorter EFS, while high expression of lncRNA ANRIL and poorer risk stratification were independent prognostic factors for shorter OS. The present results suggested that lncRNA ANRIL has clinical relevance as a biomarker for assisting diagnosis treatment decisions and prognosis prediction and the identification of potential drug target for AML.","['Tan, Zhenqing', 'Zhu, Kaibo', 'Yin, Yafei', 'Luo, Zimian']","['Tan Z', 'Zhu K', 'Yin Y', 'Luo Z']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20201210,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*long noncoding RNA ANRIL', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*disease risk', '*risk stratification', '*prognosis']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:59'],"['2020/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:59 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2020.11751 [doi]', '112 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Feb;23(2). pii: 112. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2020.11751.

Herein, we aimed to identify the key genes and pathways involved in adult AML with DNMT3A mutations and to find possible therapeutic targets for improving treatment. Methods: The RNA sequencing datasets of 170 adult AML patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. EdgeR of the R platform was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed by Metascape and DAVID. And protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and clustering modules were analyzed with the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Results: Mutated DNMT3A resulted in a shorter overall survival (OS) in AML patients and obviously associated with age, blast percentage in peripheral blood, and FLT3 mutation. A total of 283 DEGs were detected, of which 95 were upregulated and 188 were downregulated. GO term analysis showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in neutrophil degranulation, myeloid cell differentiation, stem cell proliferation, positive regulation of neurological system process, leukocyte migration, and tissue morphogenesis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the pathway of cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer may play a crucial role in DNMT3A mutation AML. Seven hub genes (BMP4, MPO, THBS1, APP, ELANE, HOXA7, and VWF) had a significant prognostic value. Conclusion: Bioinformatics analysis in the present study provided novel targets for early diagnosis and new strategies for treatment for AML with DNMT3A mutation.","['Chen, Shuyi', 'Chen, Yimin', 'Lu, Jielun', 'Yuan, Danyun', 'He, Lang', 'Tan, Huo', 'Xu, Lihua']","['Chen S', 'Chen Y', 'Lu J', 'Yuan D', 'He L', 'Tan H', 'Xu L']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8878-3534', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3437-1286']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201123,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/06/09 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:58'],"['2020/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/9321630 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Nov 23;2020:9321630. doi: 10.1155/2020/9321630. eCollection 2020.,20210608,['Copyright (c) 2020 Shuyi Chen et al.'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China.', 'Department of Urology & Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Institute of Urology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China.', 'Department of Urology & Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Institute of Urology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China.', 'Department of Urology & Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Institute of Urology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China.', 'Department of Urology & Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Institute of Urology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510000, China.', 'Department of Urology & Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Institute of Urology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Treatment Outcome']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,PMC7707947,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, adipocytes could be utilized to control progression for some types of cancer, such as leukemia and breast cancer. To explore the potential correlation between adipocytes and cancer, the combined effect of expression levels of obesity-related genes and clinical factors (i.e., gender, race, menopausal status, history of smoking, tumor grade, body mass index (BMI), and history of drinking) on cancer survival rate was systemically studied. The expression levels of obesity-related genes in cancer tissues and normal tissues were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted using R programming language. The log-rank test was applied to explore the correlation between different clinical subgroups. The overexpression of the nine obesity-related genes (MC4R, TMEM18, KCTD15, GNPDA2, SH2B1, MTCH2, FTO, PCSK1, and GPR120) may associate with tumor-promoting factors in some organs (head and neck, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and gallbladder). Underexpressed LEPR, NEGR1, TMEM18, and SH2B1 genes prevented the progression and metastasis of kidney cancer. The combined effect of clinical factors and the expression levels of obesity-related genes on patients' survival was found to be significant. Our outcomes suggested that the alternations of DNA methylation patterns could result in the changes of expression levels of obesity-related genes, playing a critical role in tumor progression. The results of the current study may be utilized to supplement precision and personalized medicine, as well as provide novel insights for the development of treatment approaches for cancer.","['Huang, Ting', 'Huang, Xuan', 'Nie, Yumin', 'Shi, Xiangkui', 'Shu, Chuanjun']","['Huang T', 'Huang X', 'Nie Y', 'Shi X', 'Shu C']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0196-0962', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1427-2037']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201124,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:58'],"['2020/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8838676 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Nov 24;2020:8838676. doi: 10.1155/2020/8838676. eCollection 2020.,20210507,['Copyright (c) 2020 Ting Huang et al.'],"['Department of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Xuzhou 221000, China.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Jinling Hospital Affiliated to The Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing 210002, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Biomedical Engineering and Informatics, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Xuzhou 221000, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Biomedical Engineering and Informatics, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.']",,"['DNA Copy Number Variations/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality', 'Obesity/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.'],,,PMC7707943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Children with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled. Renal functions before the administration of HDMTX were assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and GFRGates, respectively, before the first cycle of HDMTX after induction therapy. The areas under the ROC curve were used to assess covariates' ability to predict HDMTX-induced AKI. Results: 102 children with ALL were included in the study. A stepwise backward binary logistic regression showed that only standardized GFRGates was an independent risk factor for HDMTX-induced AKI (p = 0.018, odds ratio 0.985, 95% CI 0.972-0.997). The area under the ROC of standardized GFRGates was 0.679 (p = 0.012, 95% CI 0.554-0.804). Conclusion: Standardized GFRGates showed that the normal renal function of children is not enough to be used as a cutoff point to predict HDMTX-induced AKI in ALL children receiving HDMTX. More attention and supportive care should be given to the children with standardized GFRGates lower than the cutoff value to avoid the HDMTX-induced AKI.","['Wang, Lidan', 'Chen, Kailan', 'Xu, Qiong']","['Wang L', 'Chen K', 'Xu Q']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2889-3165'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201117,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/06/09 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:58'],"['2020/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/3687134 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Nov 17;2020:3687134. doi: 10.1155/2020/3687134. eCollection 2020.,20210608,['Copyright (c) 2020 Lidan Wang et al.'],"[""Department of Radiology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.""]","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'VW78417PU1 (Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['Acute Kidney Injury/complications/*diagnostic imaging', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', '*Kidney Function Tests', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk Factors', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate/*chemistry']",['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.'],,,PMC7700889,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the cancer risks at multiple sites for solid organ transplant recipients and their associations with tumor mutation burden (TMB), which reflects the immunogenicity. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Random effects models were used to calculate the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) versus the general population and determine the risks of different cancers. Linear regression (LR) was used to analyze the association between the SIRs and TMBs. Finally, seventy-two articles met our criteria, involving 2,105,122 solid organ transplant recipients. Compared with the general population, solid organ transplant recipients displayed a 2.68-fold cancer risk (SIR 2.68; 2.48-2.89; P <.001), renal transplant recipients displayed a 2.56-fold cancer risk (SIR 2.56; 2.31-2.84; P <.001), liver transplant recipients displayed a 2.45-fold cancer risk (SIR 2.45; 2.22-2.70; P <.001), heart and/or lung transplant recipients displayed a 3.72-fold cancer risk (SIR 3.72; 3.04-4.54; P <.001). The correlation coefficients between SIRs and TMBs were 0.68, 0.64, 0.59, 0.79 in solid organ recipients, renal recipients, liver recipients, heart and/or lung recipients, respectively. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that solid organ transplant recipients displayed a higher risk of some site-specific cancers, providing individualized guidance for clinicians to early detect, evaluate, and treat cancer among solid organ transplantation recipients. In addition, the increased cancer risk of solid organ transplant recipients is associated with TMB, suggesting that iatrogenic immunosuppression may contribute to the increased cancer risk in transplant recipients.

ESB chemical structure contains a dichloro-fluorophenyl ring and cyclic tertiary amine rings (piperazine) that can be bioactivated generating reactive intermediates. Methods: In vitro metabolic study of ESB with human liver microsomes (HLMs) was performed and the hypothesis of generating reactive intermediates during metabolism was tested utilizing trapping agents to capture and stabilize reactive intermediates to facilitate their LC-MS/MS detection. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and potassium cyanide (KCN) were utilized as trapping agents for quinone methide and iminium intermediates, respectively. Results: Four in vitro ESB phase I metabolites were characterized. Three reactive intermediates including one epoxide and one iminium intermediates were characterized. ESB bioactivation is proposed to occur through unexpected metabolic pathways. The piperazine ring was bioactivated through iminium ions intermediates generation, while the dichloro-phenyl group was bioactivated through a special mechanism that was revealed by LC-MS/MS. Conclusion: These findings lay the foundations for additional work on ESB toxicity. Substituents to the bioactive centers (piperazine ring), either for blocking or isosteric replacement, would likely block or interrupt hydroxylation reaction that will end the bioactivation sequence.","['Abdelhameed, Ali S', 'Attwa, Mohamed W', 'Kadi, Adnan A']","['Abdelhameed AS', 'Attwa MW', 'Kadi AA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5910-2832', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1147-4960']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201130,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['epoxide intermediates', 'human liver microsomes', 'iminium intermediates', 'in vitro phase-I metabolites']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/09/22 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:56'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:56 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S274018 [doi]', '274018 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 Nov 30;14:5259-5273. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S274018. eCollection 2020.,20210921,['(c) 2020 Abdelhameed et al.'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyridazines)', 'SMA5ZS5B22 (ensartinib)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Microsomes, Liver/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyridazines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Software', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest for this work.'],,,PMC7721118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A protocol for such additions to parthenolide is outlined herein. Reaction conditions were determined using tulipane as a model Michael acceptor. Subsequently, aniline-containing parthenolide derivatives were prepared under the optimised conditions and single crystal X-ray diffraction structures were resolved for three of the compounds synthesised. The synthesised derivatives, along with compounds resulting from a side reaction, were tested for their in vitro anti-leukaemia activity using the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) MEC1 cell line. Computational studies with the 2RAM protein structure suggested that the activity of the derivatives was independent of their in silico ability to dock with the Cys38 residue of NF-kappaB.","['Quy, Alex S', 'Li, Xingjian', 'Male, Louise', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Fossey, John S']","['Quy AS', 'Li X', 'Male L', 'Stankovic T', 'Agathanggelou A', 'Fossey JS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Tetrahedron,Tetrahedron,2984170R,,['NOTNLM'],"['1,4-Conjugate addition', 'Aniline', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)', 'Leukemia', 'Natural product derivatives', 'Parthenolide (PTL)']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:01,['2020/12/10 05:56'],"['2020/12/10 05:56 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.tet.2020.131631 [doi]', 'S0040-4020(20)30838-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Tetrahedron. 2020 Nov 27;76(48):131631. doi: 10.1016/j.tet.2020.131631.,,['Crown Copyright (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],"['School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West Midlands, B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West Midlands, B15 2TT, UK.', 'X-Ray Crystallography Facility, School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West Midlands, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', 'Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West Midlands, B15 2TT, UK.']",,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,PMC7695678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the prevalence of antibodies against PEG among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prior to and/or immediately after their first dose of pegylated E.coli asparaginase (PEG-ASNase). Serum samples of 701 children, 673 with primary ALL, 28 with relapsed ALL, and 188 adults with primary ALL were analyzed for anti-PEG IgG and IgM. Measurements in 58 healthy infants served as reference to define cut-points for antibody-positive and -negative samples. Anti-PEG antibodies were detected in ALL patients prior the first PEG-ASNase with a prevalence of 13.9% (anti-PEG IgG) and 29.1% (anti-PEG IgM). After administration of PEG-ASNase the prevalence of anti-PEG antibodies decreased to 4.2% for anti-PEG IgG and to 4.5% for anti-PEG IgM. Pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies did not inhibit PEG-ASNase activity but significantly reduced PEGASNase activity levels in a concentration dependent manner.

Herein we demonstrate that the inv(16)/KIT(D816Y) AML mouse model exhibits constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, which was enhanced by chemotherapy-induced DNA damage through DNA-PK-dependent AKT phosphorylation. Strikingly, inhibitors of either PI3K or DNA-PK markedly reduced chemotherapy-induced AKT phosphorylation and signaling leading to increased DNA damage and apoptosis of inv(16)/KIT(D816Y) AML cells in response to chemotherapy. Consistently, combinations of chemotherapy and PI3K or DNA-PK inhibitors synergistically inhibited growth and survival of clonogenic AML cells without substantially inhibiting normal clonogenic bone marrow cells. Moreover, treatment of inv(16)/KIT(D816Y) AML mice with combinations of chemotherapy and PI3K or DNA-PK inhibitors significantly prolonged survival compared to untreated/single-treated mice. Mechanistically, our findings implicate that constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT signaling driven by mutant KIT, and potentially other mutational activators such as FLT3 and RAS, cooperates with chemotherapy-induced DNA-PK-dependent activation of AKT to promote survival, DNA repair, and chemotherapy resistance in AML. Hence, our study provides a rationale to select AML patients exhibiting constitutive PI3K/AKT activation for simultaneous treatment with chemotherapy and inhibitors of DNA-PK and PI3K to improve chemotherapy response and clinical outcome.","['Estruch, Montserrat', 'Reckzeh, Kristian', 'Vittori, Camilla', 'Centio, Anders', 'Ali, Mina', 'Engelhard, Sophia', 'Zhao, Ling', 'Won, Kyoung Jae', 'Liu, Paul', 'Porse, Bo Torben', 'Theilgaard-Monch, Kim']","['Estruch M', 'Reckzeh K', 'Vittori C', 'Centio A', 'Ali M', 'Engelhard S', 'Zhao L', 'Won KJ', 'Liu P', 'Porse BT', 'Theilgaard-Monch K']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7162-4158', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6391-625X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9995-715X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1583-1010', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4239-4939']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201209,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:53'],"['2020/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 05:53 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01094-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01094-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jul;35(7):2030-2042. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01094-0.

The PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint downregulates T-cell activity. Here, we examined if these two immunosuppressive nodes intersect. Using normal and malignant lymphocytes from humans, and the phosphodiesterase 4b (Pde4b) knockout mouse, we found that cAMP induces PD-L1 transcription and protein expression. Mechanistically, we discovered that the cAMP effectors PKA and CREB induce the transcription/secretion of IL-10, IL-8, and IL-6, which initiate an autocrine loop that activates the JAK/STAT pathway and ultimately increase PD-L1 expression in the cell surface. This signaling axis is disarmed at two specific nodes in subsets of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which may help explain the variable PD-L1 expression in these tumors. In vivo, we found that despite its immunosuppressive attributes, the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast did not decrease the clinical activity of checkpoint inhibitors, an important clinical observation given the approved use of these agents in multiple diseases. In summary, we discovered that PD-L1 induction is a part of the repertoire of immunosuppressive actions mediated by cAMP, defined a cytokine-mediated autocrine loop that executes this action and, reassuringly, showed that PDE4 inhibition does not antagonize immune checkpoint blockade in an in vivo syngeneic lymphoma model.","['Sasi, Binu', 'Ethiraj, Purushoth', 'Myers, Jamie', 'Lin, An-Ping', 'Jiang, Shoulei', 'Qiu, Zhijun', 'Holder, Kenneth N', 'Aguiar, Ricardo C T']","['Sasi B', 'Ethiraj P', 'Myers J', 'Lin AP', 'Jiang S', 'Qiu Z', 'Holder KN', 'Aguiar RCT']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3325-9874', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8791-5849']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20201209,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:53'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 05:53 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01105-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01105-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jul;35(7):1990-2001. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01105-0.

While children are generally thought to be at less risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults, comprehensive population-based evidence for the risk in children with cancer is unavailable. We aimed to produce evidence of the incidence and outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 in children with cancer attending all hospitals treating this population across the UK. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective observational study of all children in the UK under 16 diagnosed with cancer through data collection from all hospitals providing cancer care to this population. Eligible patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The primary end-point was death, discharge or end of active care for COVID-19 for those remaining in hospital. RESULTS: Between 12 March 2020 and 31 July 2020, 54 cases were identified: 15 (28%) were asymptomatic, 34 (63%) had mild infections and 5 (10%) moderate, severe or critical infections. No patients died and only three patients required intensive care support due to COVID-19. Estimated incidence of hospital identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with cancer under 16 was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cancer with SARS-CoV-2 infection do not appear at increased risk of severe infection compared to the general paediatric population. This is reassuring and supports the continued delivery of standard treatment.","['Millen, Gerard C', 'Arnold, Roland', 'Cazier, Jean-Baptiste', 'Curley, Helen', 'Feltbower, Richard G', 'Gamble, Ashley', 'Glaser, Adam W', 'Grundy, Richard G', 'Lee, Lennard Y W', 'McCabe, Martin G', 'Phillips, Robert S', 'Stiller, Charles A', 'Varnai, Csilla', 'Kearns, Pamela R']","['Millen GC', 'Arnold R', 'Cazier JB', 'Curley H', 'Feltbower RG', 'Gamble A', 'Glaser AW', 'Grundy RG', 'Lee LYW', 'McCabe MG', 'Phillips RS', 'Stiller CA', 'Varnai C', 'Kearns PR']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1446-3228', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8993-8438']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20201210,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:50'],"['2020/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/10 05:50 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-01181-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-01181-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2021 Feb;124(4):754-759. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-01181-0.

We aimed at exploring the associations between biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial function, endotoxemia and cardiometabolic risk factors. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in 246 cALL survivors (mean age, 22.1 +/- 6.3 years; mean time since diagnosis, 15.5 +/- 5.2 years) and evaluated the associations using a series of logistic regressions. Using structural equation models, we also tested if the relationship between endotoxemia and cardiometabolic complications was mediated by the latent (unobserved) variable inflammation inferred from the observed biomarkers CRP, TNF-alpha and IL-6. High leptin-adiponectin ratio was associated with obesity [adjusted OR = 15.7; 95% CI (6.2-39.7)], insulin resistance [20.6 (5.2-82.1)] and the metabolic syndrome [11.2 (2.6-48.7)]. Higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were associated with obesity [3.37 (1.6-7.1) and 2.34 (1.3-4.2), respectively] whereas high C-reactive protein levels were associated with insulin resistance [3.3 (1.6-6.8)], dyslipidemia [2.6 (1.4-4.9)] and MetS [6.5 (2.4-17.9)]. Our analyses provided evidence for a directional relationship between lipopolysaccharide binding protein, related to metabolic endotoxemia, inflammation and cardiometabolic outcomes. Identification of biomarkers and biological mechanisms could open new avenues for prevention strategies to minimize the long-term sequelae, improve follow-up and optimize the quality of life of this

However, oncogenic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) cooperating with PML/RARalpha remain under-explored. Here, we first identified a set of pathogenesis-related lncRNAs, aberrantly expressed in APL using RNA-seq data from a large cohort of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and normal counterparts. Among the pathogenesis-related lncRNAs, one of the evolutionarily conservative lncRNAs CRNDE (Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed) drew our attention. We found that CRNDE was highly expressed in the disease state but not in the preleukemic stage of APL, suggesting that CRNDE might be a secondary event coordinating with PML/RARalpha to promote APL development. Functional analysis showed that CRNDE knockdown induced differentiation and inhibited proliferation of APL cells, and prolonged survival of APL mice. Further mechanistic studies showed that CRNDE elicited its oncogenic effects through binding the miR-181 family and thereby regulating NOTCH2. Finally, we found that high CRNDE expression was also significantly correlated with NPM1 mutations and contributed to the differentiation block in NPM1-mutant AML. Collectively, our findings shed light on the importance of oncogenic lncRNAs in the development of AML and provide a promising target for AML therapy.","['Ma, Xuefei', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Li, Shufen', 'Jin, Wen', 'Wang, Kankan']","['Ma X', 'Zhang W', 'Zhao M', 'Li S', 'Jin W', 'Wang K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7198-2134'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201111,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:01,['2020/12/10 05:43'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:43 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41420-020-00359-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41420-020-00359-y [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2020 Nov 11;6(1):121. doi: 10.1038/s41420-020-00359-y.,,,"['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China. jw11862@rjh.com.cn.', 'CNRS-LIA Hematology and Cancer, Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China. jw11862@rjh.com.cn.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China. kankanwang@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240, Shanghai, China. kankanwang@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'CNRS-LIA Hematology and Cancer, Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China. kankanwang@shsmu.edu.cn.']",,,,,"['81530003/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81890994/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81770513/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81530003/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81890994/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81770513/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81530003/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81890994/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81770513/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81530003/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81890994/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81770513/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81530003/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81890994/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81770513/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)']",PMC7658230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that SN3-L6 induces transdifferentiation of both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells but unexpectedly, a new transdifferentiation pathway from APL cells to morphologically and immunologically normal megakaryocytes and platelets were discovered. SN3-L6 fails to induce transdifferentiation of ATRA-produced mature granulocytes into megakaryocytes, indicating its selectivity between mature and immature cells. SN3-L6 induces CML K562 cells to transdifferentiate into apoptotic megakaryocytes but without platelet formation, indicating a desirable selectivity between different leukemia cells.

Nevertheless, because of artifacts introduced during library preparation and sequencing, the detection of low-frequency variants at high specificity is problematic. Here, we present Espresso, an error suppression method that considers local sequence features to accurately detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). Compared to other advanced error suppression techniques, Espresso consistently demonstrated lower numbers of false-positive mutation calls and greater sensitivity. We demonstrated Espresso's superior performance in detecting MRD in the peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) throughout their treatment course. Furthermore, we showed that accurate mutation calling in a small number of informative genomic loci might provide a cost-efficient strategy for pragmatic risk prediction of AML development in healthy individuals. More broadly, we aim for Espresso to aid with accurate mutation detection in many other research and clinical settings.","['Abelson, Sagi', 'Zeng, Andy G X', 'Nofech-Mozes, Ido', 'Wang, Ting Ting', 'Ng, Stanley W K', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Pugh, Trevor J', 'Awadalla, Philip', 'Shlush, Liran I', 'Murphy, Tracy', 'Chan, Steven M', 'Dick, John E', 'Bratman, Scott V']","['Abelson S', 'Zeng AGX', 'Nofech-Mozes I', 'Wang TT', 'Ng SWK', 'Minden MD', 'Pugh TJ', 'Awadalla P', 'Shlush LI', 'Murphy T', 'Chan SM', 'Dick JE', 'Bratman SV']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1747-3819', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1973-5472', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9089-8816', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8073-5888', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4354-0731', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9527-8317', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8610-4908']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:41'],"['2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [medline]']","['6/50/eabe3722 [pii]', '10.1126/sciadv.abe3722 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2020 Dec 9;6(50). pii: 6/50/eabe3722. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abe3722.

Here, we describe a simple method to obtain therapeutics-containing ""dead cells"" by shocking live cancer cells in liquid nitrogen to eliminate pathogenicity while preserving their major structure and chemotaxis toward the lesion site. In an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mouse model, we demonstrated that the liquid nitrogen-treated AML cells (LNT cells) can augment targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) toward the bone marrow. Moreover, LNT cells serve as a cancer vaccine and promote antitumor immune responses that prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Preimmunization with LNT cells along with an adjuvant also protected healthy mice from AML cell challenge.","['Ci, Tianyuan', 'Li, Hongjun', 'Chen, Guojun', 'Wang, Zejun', 'Wang, Jinqiang', 'Abdou, Peter', 'Tu, Yiming', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Gu, Zhen']","['Ci T', 'Li H', 'Chen G', 'Wang Z', 'Wang J', 'Abdou P', 'Tu Y', 'Dotti G', 'Gu Z']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2887-3642', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1765-8445', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0313-5819', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0048-838X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4195-3903', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2639-8526', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2947-4456']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,IM,,,2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:41'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [medline]']","['6/50/eabc3013 [pii]', '10.1126/sciadv.abc3013 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2020 Dec 9;6(50). pii: 6/50/eabc3013. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abc3013.

Patterns of CLL evolution under ibrutinib therapy are well characterized for the leukemic cells but not for their microenvironment. METHODS: Here, we addressed this question at the single cell level of both transcriptome and immune-phenotype. The PBMCs from a CLL patient were monitored during ibrutinib treatment using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-Seq) technology. RESULTS: This unveiled that the short clinical relapse of this patient driven by BTK mutation is associated with intraclonal heterogeneity in B leukemic cells and up-regulation of common signaling pathways induced by ibrutinib in both B leukemic cells and immune cells. This approach also pinpointed a subset of leukemic cells present before treatment and highly enriched during progression under ibrutinib. These latter exhibit an original gene signature including up-regulated BCR, MYC-activated, and other targetable pathways. Meanwhile, although ibrutinib differentially affected the exhaustion of T lymphocytes, this treatment enhanced the T cell cytotoxicity even during disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: These results could open new alternative of therapeutic strategies for ibrutinib-refractory CLL patients, based on immunotherapy or targeting B leukemic cells themselves.","['Cadot, Sarah', 'Valle, Carine', 'Tosolini, Marie', 'Pont, Frederic', 'Largeaud, Laetitia', 'Laurent, Camille', 'Fournie, Jean Jacques', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Quillet-Mary, Anne']","['Cadot S', 'Valle C', 'Tosolini M', 'Pont F', 'Largeaud L', 'Laurent C', 'Fournie JJ', 'Ysebaert L', 'Quillet-Mary A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1849-6388'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201209,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,['NOTNLM'],"['CITESeq', 'CLL', 'Ibrutinib', 'Immune cells']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:01,['2020/12/10 05:38'],"['2020/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-00253-w [doi]', '10.1186/s40364-020-00253-w [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 Dec 9;8(1):72. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-00253-w.,,,"['Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France."", 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France."", 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France. anne.quillet-mary@inserm.fr.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France. anne.quillet-mary@inserm.fr.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France. anne.quillet-mary@inserm.fr.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, TOUCAN, Toulouse, France. anne.quillet-mary@inserm.fr.""]",,,,,,PMC7724843,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many patients experience a relapse or exhibit refractory disease (R/R). There is an urgent need for more effective regimens to reverse anthracycline resistance in these patients. METHODS: In this paper, Twenty-seven R/R AML patients with anthracycline resistance consecutively received chidamide in combination with anthracycline-based regimen as salvage therapy at the Chinese PLA General Hospital. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients who had received one course of salvage therapy, 13 achieved a complete response and 1 achieved a partial response. We found that the HDAC3-AKT-P21-CDK2 signaling pathway was significantly upregulated in anthracycline-resistant AML cells compared to non-resistant cells. AML patients with higher levels of HDAC3 had lower event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates. Moreover, anthracycline-resistant AML cells are susceptible to chidamide, a histone deacetylase inhibitor which can inhibit cell proliferation, increase cell apoptosis and induce cell-cycle arrest in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Chidamide increases the sensitivity of anthracycline-resistant cells to anthracycline drugs, and these effects are associated with the inhibition of the HDAC3-AKT-P21-CDK2 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Chidamide can increase anthracycline drug sensitivity by inhibiting HDAC3-AKT-P21-CDK2 signaling pathway, thus demonstrating the potential for application.","['Wang, Hao', 'Liu, Yu-Chen',

However, with concomitant anticoagulation (AC) and antiplatelet (AP) therapy, ibrutinib is associated with increased bleeding. This post hoc analysis aimed to determine the role of AC/AP therapy in patients with idelalisib-treated B-cell malignancies and to establish if it contributes to increased bleeding events. Data from two idelalisib trials (rituximab +/- idelalisib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and idelalisib monotherapy in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma [iNHL]) were analyzed. Antithrombotic therapy was common (36%-63%), with comparable bleeding incidence across treatment groups (14%-19%; p = 0.56). Bleeding events of grade >/=3 occurred in 0.9% and 3.2% of the idelalisib-treated CLL and iNHL cohorts, respectively. Our findings demonstrate no increase in bleeding events with simultaneous AC/AP treatment and idelalisib use.

Studies have reported HBVr associated with immunosuppressive medications, such as rituximab, methotrexate, and high dose steroids. There are different risks for different types of chemotherapy with rituximab carrying one of the highest risks for hepatitis B reactivation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard of care in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The risk of HBVr in chronic myeloid leukemia has been reported in many studies, but to this date, there are no clear guidelines or recommendations regarding screening and monitoring of HBV in CML patients receiving TKIs. We conducted this review to identify the risk of HBVr in patients with CML who are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We recommend testing for HBV status in patients who are to be treated with TKIs and to consider giving prophylaxis in those who are positive for HBsAg at baseline. More studies are needed to assess the risk of reactivation in patients with Hepatitis B core antibody positive receiving TKIs. Currently, monitoring such patients for reactivation may be the best strategy.","['Atteya, Asmaa', 'Ahmad, Aiman', 'Daghstani, Dima', 'Mushtaq, Kamran', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Atteya A', 'Ahmad A', 'Daghstani D', 'Mushtaq K', 'Yassin MA']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1787-640X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1144-8076']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'hepatitis B', 'hepatitis B reactivation', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2020/12/10 05:33'],"['2020/12/10 05:33 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1073274820976594 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2020 Jan-Dec;27(1):1073274820976594. doi: 10.1177/1073274820976594.,20210906,,"['National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Doha, Qatar.', 'Gastroenterology Department, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Gastroenterology Department, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']","['Antibiotic Prophylaxis/methods/standards', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring/standards', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B virus/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*diagnosis/immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mass Screening/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Virus Activation/drug effects/*immunology']",,,,PMC8480343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that LH blockade improves hematopoietic recovery following intensive chemotherapy in patients with leukemia. We conducted a retrospective analysis on pre-menopausal women with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received intensive chemotherapy and leuprolide given for abnormal uterine bleeding prevention or treatment. Given that leuprolide was more commonly administered in younger patients, we performed propensity score matching between the leuprolide (AML N=64; ALL N=49) and control groups (AML N=128; ALL N=98 patients).

Until recently, in vitro isolation and propagation of the virus have not been successful. This study aimed to isolate and propagate EEHV using continuous cell lines derived from human and/or animal origins. Human cell lines, including EA. hy926, A549, U937, RKO, SW620, HCT-116 and HT-29, and animal cell lines, including CT26.CL25 and sp2/0-Ag14, were investigated in this study. Mixed frozen tissue samples of the heart, lung, liver, spleen and kidney obtained from fatal EEHV1A- or EEHV4-infected cases were homogenized and used for cell inoculation. At 6, 24, 48 and 72 h post infection (hpi), EEHV-inoculated cells were observed for cytopathic effects (CPEs) or were assessed for EEHV infection by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) or quantitative PCR. The results were then compared to those of the mock-infected controls. Replication of EEHV in the tested cells was further determined by immunohistochemistry of cell pellets using anti-EEHV DNA polymerase antibodies or re-inoculated cells with supernatants obtained from passages 2 or 3 of the culture medium. The results reveal that no CPEs were observed in the tested cells, while immunolabeling for EEHV gB was observed in only U937 human myeloid leukemia cells. However, quantitation values of the EEHV terminase gene, as well as those of the EEHV gB or EEHV DNA polymerase proteins in U937 cells, gradually declined from passage 1 to passage 3. The findings of this study indicate that despite poor adaptation in U937 cells, this cell line displays promise and potential to be used for the isolation of EEHV1 and EEHV4 in vitro.","['Photichai, Kornravee', 'Guntawang, Thunyamas', 'Sittisak, Tidaratt', 'Kochagul, Varankpicha', 'Chuammitri, Phongsakorn', 'Thitaram, Chatchote', 'Thananchai, Hathairat', 'Chewonarin, Teera', 'Sringarm, Korawan', 'Pringproa, Kidsadagon']","['Photichai K', 'Guntawang T', 'Sittisak T', 'Kochagul V', 'Chuammitri P', 'Thitaram C', 'Thananchai H', 'Chewonarin T', 'Sringarm K', 'Pringproa K']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9319-5596', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9044-3777', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0089-8183']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201207,Switzerland,Animals (Basel),Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,101635614,,['NOTNLM'],"['cell culture', 'elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus', 'in vitro', 'isolation']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:01,['2020/12/10 01:03'],"['2020/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['ani10122328 [pii]', '10.3390/ani10122328 [doi]']",epublish,Animals (Basel). 2020 Dec 7;10(12). pii: ani10122328. doi: 10.3390/ani10122328.,,,"['Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Veterinary Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Veterinary Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Veterinary Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.', 'Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Veterinary Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.', 'Department of Companion Animals and Wildlife Clinics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Animal and Aquatic Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Veterinary Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.', 'Excellence Center in Veterinary Bioscience, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.']",,,,,,PMC7762348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) has been previously demonstrated in various pediatric tumors, but limited information exists on the expression and characteristics of SST receptors (SSTR) in hematological and oncological disorders of children. We aimed to investigate the expression of mRNA for SSTR subtypes (SSTR-1-5) in 15 pediatric hematological/oncological specimens by RT-PCR. The presence and binding characteristics of SSTRs were further studies by ligand competition assay. Our results show that the pediatric tumor samples highly expressed mRNA for the five SSTR subtypes with various patterns. The mRNA for SSTR-2 was detected in all specimens independently of their histological type. A Hodgkin lymphoma sample co-expressed mRNA for all five SSTR subtypes. SSTR-3 and SSTR-5 were detected only in malignant specimens, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and a single nonmalignant condition, hereditary spherocytosis. The incidence of SSTR-1 and SSTR-4 was similar (60%) in the 15 specimens investigated. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated the presence of specific SSTRs and high affinity binding of SST analogs in pediatric solid tumors investigated. The high incidence of SSTRs in hematological and oncological disorders in children supports the merit of further investigation of SSTRs as molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy.","['Harda, Kristof', 'Szabo, Zsuzsanna', 'Juhasz, Eva', 'Dezso, Balazs', 'Kiss, Csongor', 'Schally, Andrew V', 'Halmos, Gabor']","['Harda K', 'Szabo Z', 'Juhasz E', 'Dezso B', 'Kiss C', 'Schally AV', 'Halmos G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5181-0693', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4838-4210', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5170-5965']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201207,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['hematological-oncological disorders in children', 'somatostatin analogs', 'somatostatin receptors']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/12/10 01:03'],"['2020/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25235775 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25235775 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Dec 7;25(23). pii: molecules25235775. doi: 10.3390/molecules25235775.,20210419,,"['Department of Biopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Doctoral School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Biopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Endocrine, Polypeptide and Cancer Institute, Miami, FL 33125, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33101, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Divisions of Hematology-Oncology and Endocrinology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33101, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Biopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Endocrine, Polypeptide and Cancer Institute, Miami, FL 33125, USA.']","['0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', '0 (somatostatin receptor type 1)', '8X85ZJG6XJ (somatostatin receptor 5)']","['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/*genetics/metabolism']",,,"['NKFIH-1150-6/2019/Nemzeti Kutatasi Fejlesztesi es Innovacios Hivatal', 'UNKP-19-3/Magyarorszag Kormanya', 'GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00043/Magyarorszag Kormanya', 'EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00022/Magyarorszag Kormanya']",PMC7730851,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, ongoing pain may continue to impact quality of life in survivorship.

Pain management in children is often inadequate because of difficulties in pain assessment, different indications across countries, and the lack of specific pediatric trials. Analgesic drugs are often prescribed off-label to children by extrapolating information from adult guidelines, with possible increased risk of adverse events.

In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of a macrophage polarization network, following two lines of enquiry: (i) we reconstruct the macrophage polarization network based on literature, extending it to include important stimuli in a tumour setting, and (ii) we build a dynamical model able to reproduce macrophage polarization in the presence of different stimuli, including the contact with cancer cells. Our simulations recapitulate the documented macrophage phenotypes and their dependencies on specific receptors and transcription factors, while also unravelling the formation of a special type of tumour associated macrophages in an in vitro model of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This model constitutes the first step towards elucidating the cross-talk between immune and cancer cells inside tumours, with the ultimate goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that could control the formation of tumour associated macrophages in patients.","['Marku, Malvina', 'Verstraete, Nina', 'Raynal, Flavien', 'Madrid-Mencia, Miguel', 'Domagala, Marcin', 'Fournie, Jean-Jacques', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Poupot, Mary', 'Pancaldi, Vera']","['Marku M', 'Verstraete N', 'Raynal F', 'Madrid-Mencia M', 'Domagala M', 'Fournie JJ', 'Ysebaert L', 'Poupot M', 'Pancaldi V']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3552-6777', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3998-5316', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7433-624X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201207,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['Boolean model', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'macrophage polarization', 'nurse-like cells', 'tumour associated macrophage']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/11 06:01,['2020/12/10 01:03'],"['2020/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123664 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123664 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 7;12(12). pii: cancers12123664. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123664.,,,"['INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, 31330 Toulouse, France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, 2 Avenue Hubert Curien, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite III Toulouse Paul Sabatier, Route de Narbonne, 31330 Toulouse, France.', 'Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Carrer de Jordi Girona, 29, 31, 08034 Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,"['0000/INSERM, the Fondation Toulouse Cancer Sante and Pierre Fabre Research', 'Institute']",PMC7762229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical component of the Mediterranean diet is olive oil, and the relationship between olive oil consumption and the reduced risk of cancer has been established. Oleuropein (OL) is the most prominent polyphenol component of olive fruits and leaves. This compound has been shown to have potent properties in various types of cancers, including breast cancer. In the present study, the molecular mechanism of OL was examined in two racially different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines-African American (AA, MDA-MB-468) and Caucasian American (CA, MDA-MB-231). The data obtained showed that OL effectively inhibits cell growth in both cell lines, concomitant with S-phase cell cycle arrest-mediated apoptosis. The results also showed that OL-treated MDA-MB-468 cells were two-fold more sensitive to OL antiproliferative effect than MDA-MB-231 cells were. At lower concentrations, OL modified the expression of many apoptosis-involved genes. OL was more effective in MDA-MB-468, compared to MDA-MB-231 cells, in terms of the number and the fold-change of the altered genes. In MDA-MB-468 cells, OL induced a noticeable transcription activation in fourteen genes, including two members of the caspase family: caspase 1 (CASP1) and caspase 14 (CASP14); two members of the TNF receptor superfamily: Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) and TNF receptor superfamily 21 (TNFRSF21); six other proapoptotic genes: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha (GADD45A), cytochrome c somatic (CYCS), BCL-2 interacting protein 2 (BNIP2), BCL-2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10); and the CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) gene. Moreover, in MDA-MB-468 cells, OL induced a significant upregulation in two antiapoptotic genes: bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR) and B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) and a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3). On the contrary, in MDA-MB-231 cells, OL showed mixed impacts on gene expression. OL significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of four genes: BIRC3, receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2), TNF receptor superfamily 10A (TNFRSF10A), and caspase 4 (CASP4). Additionally, another four genes were repressed, including caspase 6 (CASP6), pyrin domain (PYD), and caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing (PAYCARD), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), and the most downregulated TNF receptor superfamily member 11B (TNFRSF11B, 16.34-fold). In conclusion, the data obtained indicate that the two cell lines were markedly different in the anticancer effect and mechanisms of oleuropein's ability to alter apoptosis-related gene expressions. The results obtained from this study should also guide the potential utilization of oleuropein as an adjunct therapy for TNBC to increase chemotherapy effectiveness and prevent cancer progression.","['Messeha, Samia S', 'Zarmouh, Najla O', 'Asiri, Abrar', 'Soliman, Karam F A']","['Messeha SS', 'Zarmouh NO', 'Asiri A', 'Soliman KFA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0600-1085'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201207,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['MDA-MB-231', 'MDA-MB-468', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'gene expression', 'oleuropein', 'triple-negative breast cancer']",2020/12/11 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/12/10 01:03'],"['2020/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12123755 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12123755 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Dec 7;12(12). pii: nu12123755. doi: 10.3390/nu12123755.,20210427,,"['Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL 32307, USA.', 'College of Medical Technology-Misrata, Libyan National Board for Technical & Vocational Education, Misrata LY72, Libya.', 'Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL 32307, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL 32307, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iridoid Glucosides)', '0 (Iridoids)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Olive Oil)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '2O4553545L (oleuropein)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iridoid Glucosides', 'Iridoids/*pharmacology', 'Olive Oil/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/prevention & control']",,,"['U54 MD007582/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MD 007582/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7762327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vitamin C (VC), a functional nutrient, has been found to possess potent cytoprotective effects. However, there are currently no reports on its ability to treat PFOS-associated leukemia. This study used a molecular networking analysis to reveal the functional action and pharmacological mechanism of VC against PFOS-associated leukemia. The biological informatics findings revealed a total of 17 intersection targets against PFOS-associated leukemia. In addition, seven core-functional targets, including tumor protein p53 (TP53), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1), and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), were screened and identified. Notably, the molecular docking findings indicated that TP53, MAPK1, and ESR1 were potent pharmacological targets of VC against PFOS-associated leukemia. Moreover, the pharmacological functions including biological processes, cell components, and molecular pathways of VC against PFOS-associated leukemia were determined. According to the computational findings, we conclude that VC protects against PFOS-associated leukemia action by suppressing leukemia-associated cell proliferation and tumor growth. The validated genes of TP53, MAPK1, ESR1 may become potential biomarkers for monitoring and treating PFOS-associated leukemia.","['Li, Rong', 'Guo, Chao', 'Li, Yu', 'Liang, Xiao', 'Su, Min']","['Li R', 'Guo C', 'Li Y', 'Liang X', 'Su M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200904,England,Chemosphere,Chemosphere,0320657,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Molecular mechanism', 'Network pharmacology', 'Perfluorooctanesulfonate', 'Pharmacological targets', 'Vitamin C']",2020/12/11 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/12/10 01:02'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0045-6535(20)32437-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128242 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemosphere. 2021 Jan;263:128242. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128242.

The disease affects almost all countries and regions where livestock are raised, and may even be a potential zoonotic disease. Monitoring and early prevention of bovine leukemia is very important. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis, the first of its type in the country, to estimate the prevalence of bovine leukemia in 1983-2019 in China. We included a total of 35 publications reported in 1983-2019 from the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese, and Wan Fang databases. In those articles, a total of 34,954 cattle had been tested, of which 4701 were positive for BLV infection. The estimated pooled BLV prevalence was 10.0% (4701/34,954). Subgroup analysis showed that there were significant differences for sampling years, detection methods, and age. BLV prevalence was highest in the following subgroups: sampled before 1985 (38.5%, 437/1134), age 3-5 years (22.5%, 231/1044), and detected by PCR (17.9%, 1228/5100). Regarding geographic factors, there were significant differences in the latitude and elevation subgroups. BLV prevalence was lowest in the subgroups of 20-30 degrees latitude (3.3%, 255/5069) 200-1000 m altitude (2.2%, 560/11,990). We also analyzed other subgroups such as region, variety, breeding method, precipitation, humidity, and temperature, however, the differences were not significant. Our research indicated that the BLV was still prevalent in some of areas in China. We recommend strengthening the testing of cattle aged >1 year and using flexible testing methods such as PCR to control the prevalence of bovine leukemia and to prevent persistent infection.","['Ma, Bao-Yi', 'Gong, Qing-Long', 'Sheng, Chen-Yan', 'Liu, Yi', 'Ge, Gui-Yang', 'Li, Dong-Li', 'Diao, Nai-Chao', 'Shi, Kun', 'Li, Jian-Ming', 'Sun, Zhi-Bo', 'Zong, Ying', 'Leng, Xue', 'Du, Rui']","['Ma BY', 'Gong QL', 'Sheng CY', 'Liu Y', 'Ge GY', 'Li DL', 'Diao NC', 'Shi K', 'Li JM', 'Sun ZB', 'Zong Y', 'Leng X', 'Du R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20201206,England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Bovine leukemia virus', 'Cattle', 'China', 'Meta-analysis', 'Prevalence']",2020/12/10 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/12/09 20:06'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/09 20:06 [entrez]']","['S0882-4010(20)31047-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104681 [doi]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 2021 Jan;150:104681. doi: 10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104681.

Recent research identified MEIS1 as an important transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation during cell fate commitment. MEIS1 has a pro-proliferative effect in leukemia cells; however, its overexpression in cardiomyocytes restrains neonatal and adult cardiomyocyte proliferation. In addition, MEIS1 has carcinogenic or tumor suppressive effects in different neoplasms. Thus, this uncertainty suggests that MEIS1 has a unique function in cell proliferation and differentiation. In this review, we summarize the primary findings of MEIS1 in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.

Human cancer cells in most cases express higher levels of galectin-9 compared to non-transformed cells. However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here we report for the first time that in human cancer as well as embryonic cells, the transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) are involved in upregulation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) expression, leading to activation of the transcription factor Smad3 through autocrine action. This process triggers upregulation of galectin-9 expression in both malignant (mainly in breast and colorectal cancer as well as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)) and embryonic cells. The effect, however, was not observed in mature non-transformed human cells. TGF-beta1-activated Smad3 therefore displays differential behaviour in human cancer and embryonic vs non-malignant cells. This study uncovered a self-supporting biochemical mechanism underlying high levels of galectin-9 expression operated by the human cancer and embryonic cells employed in our investigations. Our results suggest the possibility of using the TGF-beta1 signalling pathway as a potential highly efficient target for cancer immunotherapy.","['Selno, Anette Teo Hansen', 'Schlichtner, Stephanie', 'Yasinska, Inna M', 'Sakhnevych, Svetlana S', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Klenova, Elena', 'Pavlova, Ludmila', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Degen, Martin', 'Schnyder, Isabelle', 'Aliu, Nijas', 'Berger, Steffen M', 'Fasler-Kan, Elizaveta', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Selno ATH', 'Schlichtner S', 'Yasinska IM', 'Sakhnevych SS', 'Fiedler W', 'Wellbrock J', 'Klenova E', 'Pavlova L', 'Gibbs BF', 'Degen M', 'Schnyder I', 'Aliu N', 'Berger SM', 'Fasler-Kan E', 'Sumbayev VV']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201208,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIF-1', '*TGF-beta', '*galectin-9', '*immune escape']",2020/12/10 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/12/09 12:12'],"['2020/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/09 12:12 [entrez]']","['202343 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.202343 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Dec 8;12(23):23478-23496. doi: 10.18632/aging.202343.

However, whether these proteins play semblable roles in pluripotent stem cell remain largely unknown. Here, we showed the differential functions of YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 in controlling the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Depletion of YTHDF3 in ESCs resulted in loss of pluripotency with accelerated expressions of marker genes involved in formation of three germ layers. Phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that loss of YTHDF1 led to dramatic impairment of cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiation, accompanied by downregulated CM-specific genes. While, knockdown of YTHDF3 accelerated differentiation through facilitating the expressions of CM-specific gene. Notably, YTHDF3 appears to modulate cellular differentiation partially through suppression of YTHDF1, supporting the distinguishable but interrelated roles of YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 in cell fate determination.","['Wang, Shen', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Wu, Xiang', 'Lin, Xianrong', 'Liu, Xiao-Min', 'Zhou, Jun']","['Wang S', 'Zhang J', 'Wu X', 'Lin X', 'Liu XM', 'Zhou J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9258-4087', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7261-2207']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201209,United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*N6-methyladenosine', '*YTHDF', '*cardiomyocyte', '*differentiation', '*embryonic stem cell']",2020/12/10 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2020/12/09 08:37'],"['2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/09 08:37 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15476286.2020.1850628 [doi]'],ppublish,RNA Biol. 2021 Sep;18(9):1354-1363. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1850628.

Few cases reported an increased risk of hepatitis B reactivation and cytomegalovirus (CMV) related infection post-Moga. However, literature is limited to mainly case reports and series, while no study has used the Food and Drug Administration adverse events reporting system (FARES) database to investigate the relationship. Methods: Using United States Food and Drug Administration adverse events reporting system database, we collected all cases of hepatitis B reactivation and CMV related infection between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019, for Moga and other drugs. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was calculated, which was considered significant when the lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) >1. Findings: Three hundred and thirty-eight total adverse cases were reported for Moga during the study period, with 261 cases reported indication for use, including cutaneous T cell lymphoma (47.04%), and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (30.18%). Eight cases were reported for hepatitis B reactivation with Moga use, compared to 2290 cases with other medications. The ROR is 143.67 (p<0.001, 95% CI, 71.17-290.04). CMV related infection was noted in 17 cases using Moga, while 12,849 cases with others. The ROR is 55.89 (p<0.001, 95% CI, 34.31-91.06). In the Moga group, five deaths occurred in hepatitis B reactivation patients and nine deaths with CMV cases. Interpretation: A signal has been identified between Moga exposure and hepatitis B reactivation as well as CMV related infection. A consideration in future studies should be placed on determining the relationship and investigating the need for pre-treatment screening, close monitoring, and utilization of prophylaxis in this population-based on pre-treatment risks.

However, the variations in CD8(+) TCR diversity and their clinical implications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients remain unknown. CD8(+) T cells were enriched from 10 healthy donors and 31 AML patients at diagnosis and after chemotherapy, and TCRbeta deep sequencing was performed to analyze CD8(+) T cell clonal expansion and TCR repertoire diversity. Diminished TCR repertoire diversity and increased T cell clone expansion were noted in the bone marrow of AML patients.

Alone or in combination with other targeted agents, venetoclax results in high rate of durable responses and undetectable measurable residual disease. The peculiarity of venetoclax is that it allows for fixed durations of therapy of 12 months in the frontline and 24 months in the relapsed/refractory setting, with a favorable impact on compliance and pharmacoeconomics. This approach implies a change of therapeutic paradigm in chronic lymphocytic leukemia from continuous to time-fixed therapy. Nowadays, it remains challenging to identify patients suitable for the optimal approach.

MPN are associated with driver mutations in JAK2, CALR and MPL which are crucial for the diagnosis and lead to a constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling, independent of cytokine regulation. Moreover, most patients have concomitant mutations in genes involved in DNA methylation, chromatin modification, messenger RNA splicing, transcription regulation and signal transduction. These additional mutations may arise before, in the context of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), or after the acquisition of the driver mutation. The clinical phenotype of MPN results from complex interactions between mutations and host factors. The increased application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to a large series of patients with MPN has expanded the knowledge of mutational landscape and contributed to define the clinical significance of mutations. This molecular information is being increasingly used to refine diagnosis, risk stratification, monitoring of residual disease and response to treatment. ASXL1, SRSF2, EZH2, IDH1/IDH2 and U2AF1 mutations are associated with a more advanced disease and reduced overall survival in primary myelofibrosis (PMF), whereas spliceosome mutations in Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) adversely affect both overall (SF3B1, SRSF2 in ET and SRSF2 in PV) and myelofibrosis-free (U2AF1, SF3B1 in ET) survival. This review discusses current knowledge of the molecular landscape of MPN, and how the availability of those molecular information may impact patient management.","['Loscocco, Giuseppe G', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M']","['Loscocco GG', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Vannucchi AM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6241-1206', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5755-0730']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201201,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK-STAT pathway', 'essential thrombocythemia', 'gene mutations', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'polycythemia vera']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 06:12'],"['2020/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 06:12 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S287944 [doi]', '287944 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Dec 1;13:12367-12382. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S287944. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Loscocco et al.'],"['CRIMM, Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione per le Malattie Mieloproliferative, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione per le Malattie Mieloproliferative, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione per le Malattie Mieloproliferative, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.']",,,"['AMV received personal fees for the advisory board from Novartis, Incyte,', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb and AOP and speaker bureau from Novartis, CTI and Celgene.', 'PG received personal fees for the advisory board from Novartis.

In this network, transcription factors regulate each other and are involved in regulatory loops with microRNAs. The microRNA cluster miR-17-92 is located within the MIR17HG gene and encodes six mature microRNAs. It is important for hematopoietic differentiation and plays a central role in malignant disease. However, the transcription factors downstream of miR-17-92 are largely elusive and the transcriptional regulation of miR-17-92 is not fully understood. Here we show that miR-17-92 forms a regulatory loop with the transcription factor TAL1. The miR-17-92 cluster inhibits expression of TAL1 and indirectly leads to decreased stability of the TAL1 transcriptional complex. We found that TAL1 and its heterodimerization partner E47 regulate miR-17-92 transcriptionally. Furthermore, miR-17-92 negatively influences erythroid differentiation, a process that depends on gene activation by the TAL1 complex. Our data give example of how transcription factor activity is fine-tuned during normal hematopoiesis. We postulate that disturbance of the regulatory loop between TAL1 and the miR-17-92 cluster could be an important step in cancer development and progression.","['Meyer, Annekarin', 'Herkt, Stefanie', 'Kunze-Schumacher, Heike', 'Kohrs, Nicole', 'Ringleb, Julia', 'Schneider, Lucas', 'Kuvardina, Olga N', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Haupl, Bjorn', 'Krueger, Andreas', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Lausen, Joern']","['Meyer A', 'Herkt S', 'Kunze-Schumacher H', 'Kohrs N', 'Ringleb J', 'Schneider L', 'Kuvardina ON', 'Oellerich T', 'Haupl B', 'Krueger A', 'Seifried E', 'Bonig H', 'Lausen J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201208,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,,2020/12/10 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/12/09 06:09'],"['2020/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 06:09 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-78629-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-78629-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Dec 8;10(1):21438. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-78629-z.,20210324,,"['Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University, 60596, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University, 60596, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, and German Red Cross Blood Service BaWuHe, Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany. joern.lausen@iig.uni-stuttgart.de.', 'Department of Eukaryotic Genetics, Institute of Industrial Genetics, University of Stuttgart, Allmandring 31, 70569, Stuttgart, Germany. joern.lausen@iig.uni-stuttgart.de.']","['0 (MIR17HG, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor 3)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']","['Erythroid Cells/*cytology', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Protein Stability', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 3/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,,,PMC7722897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, indications for and the appropriate timing of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have not yet been established. Therefore, we performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with T-LBL treated using leukemia-type initial therapies to compare the outcomes after HSCT at different disease stages. We enrolled 21 patients with T-LBL from a total of 11 centers, and all patients received hyper-CVAD as a leukemia-type initial regimen. HSCT was performed during the CR1/PR1 (standard disease) stage in 11 patients, while it was completed at a later or non-remission (advanced disease) stage in 10 patients. Following HSCT, the overall survival rate was significantly greater in standard disease than in advanced-disease patients (79.5% vs. 30.0% at 5 years; hazard ratio (HR) 5.97; p = 0.03), with trend to the lower incidence of relapse in the former group (27.3% vs. 60.0% at 5 years; HR 2.29; p = 0.19). A prognostic difference was not detected between cases treated with allogeneic and autologous HSCTs.

However, data on feasibility and efficacy of using these drugs for persisting or relapsed Ph + ALL after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) are scarce. Based on the EBMT Acute Leukemia Working Party registry, we evaluated the use of second-/third-generation TKI in 140 patients with Ph + ALL, suffering from measurable residual disease (MRD, n = 6), molecular relapse (MRel, n = 23), or hematological relapse (HRel, n = 111) following alloSCT. Treatment included dasatinib in 104, nilotinib in 18, or ponatinib in 18 patients. Forty-nine patients received TKI monotherapy, while 91 received additional treatment. Toxicity of second-/third-generation TKI post alloSCT was comparable to pretransplant use and could be managed with dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.

While T-ALL and its heterogeneous genomic landscape has been well-characterized by establishing different subtypes and risk stratification for patients, the expression and activity of microRNAs (miRNAs) in T-ALL have not been investigated as extensively as cytogenetic and genomic abnormalities. miRNAs are prospective biomarkers that can be critical in improving diagnostic measures for T-ALL, expanding risk categorizations of patients for select therapies, and as target candidates for interventional treatments. Certain miRNAs have been found to be dysregulated as a result of mechanisms underlying T-ALL pathophysiology, including aberrant signaling pathways and epigenetics. Through the implementation of more robust bioinformatics such as miRNA target prediction tools, next-generation sequencing, and standard molecular techniques, recent research has underscored the significant contribution of miRNAs toward the development and progression of T-ALL by altering canonical signaling pathways associated with T-ALL such as NOTCH1, mTOR, and PI3K/AKT. In this review, we summarize the recent findings surrounding the expression and activity of dysregulated miRNAs and how they contribute to the onset and course of disease in T-ALL. As dysregulated miRNAs have been shown to elicit positive and negative responses, the dual effects of miRNAs demand additional research to elucidate miRNAs for target treatments in addition to profiling T-ALL further as a malignant disease.","['Tse, Vincent', 'Yee, Justin', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Tse V', 'Yee J', 'Tirado CA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 06:06'],"['2020/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 06:06 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2020;46(4):211-219.,,['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],"['University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Baylor Scott and White Health, Department of Pathology, Temple, TX.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Statistical analysis of SPSS correlated the BCR-ABL gene copy number and ratio with distinct parameters. Result: We observed that BCR-ABL gene CN and ratio were significantly higher in adult CML patients as compared to childhood leukemia (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). BCR-ABL CN and ratio were significantly increased in CML patients with leukocytosis (p=0.01 and p=0.008, respectively) and thrombocytosis (p=0.05 and p=0.008, respectively). Further, CN and ratio were compared with three prognostic scores; Sokal, Hasford and EUTOS score.

Although rearrangements involving C-MYC are common in CLL, amplification is a rarer phenomenon that has not been investigated as thoroughly and may be overlooked during routine analysis. We review this case in the context of available literature on the plethora of genetic abnormalities involving C-MYC in CLL and their relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a promising strategy to prolong LFS. Nevertheless, which patients are likely to benefit from consolidative allo-HSCT, as well as the optimal therapeutic window, remain to be explored. Recent clinical data indicate that patients with complex karyotypes, adverse genes, and high pre-infusion minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry in the bone marrow, were at high risk of relapse after CAR T-cell therapy. High pre-lymphodepletion lactate dehydrogenase, low pre-lymphodepletion platelet count, absence of fludarabine in lymphodepletion, persistent leukemic sequence by high throughput sequencing in bone marrow after CAR T-cell infusion, and early loss of CAR T cells have also been linked to relapse after CAR T-cell therapy. In patients having these risk factors, consolidative allo-HSCT after CAR T-cell therapy may prolong LFS. Allo-HSCT provides optimal clinical benefit in patients with MRD-negative complete remission, typically within three months after CAR T-cell therapy. Herein, we summarize the clinical data on consolidative allo-HSCT after anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, as well as the potential factors associated with allo-HSCT benefit. We also discuss the optimal therapeutic window and regimen of consolidative allo-HSCT. Finally, and most importantly, we provide recommendations for the assessment and management of r/r B-ALL patients undergoing anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.","['Jiang, Huiwen', 'Hu, Yu', 'Mei, Heng']","['Jiang H', 'Hu Y', 'Mei H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7941-2443'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201125,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:46'],"['2020/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:46 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-00247-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s40364-020-00247-8 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 Nov 25;8(1):66. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-00247-8.,,,"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. hmei@hust.edu.cn.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, 430022, China. hmei@hust.edu.cn.']",,,,,['2019YFC1316203/National Key R&D Program of China'],PMC7687790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, relapse of primary disease remains a major obstacle after CAR T cells therapy, and the majority of relapses present a tumor phenotype with retention of target antigen (antigen-positive relapse), which highly correlate with poor CAR T cells persistence. Therefore, study on factors and mechanisms that limit the in vivo persistence of CAR T cells is crucial for developing strategies to overcome these limitations. In this review, we summarize the rapidly developing knowledge regarding the factors that influence CAR T cells in vivo persistence and the underlying mechanisms. The factors involve the CAR constructs (extracellular structures, transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains, as well as the accessory structures), activation signaling (CAR signaling and TCR engagement), methods for in vitro culture (T cells collection, purification, activation, gene transduction and cells expansion), epigenetic regulations, tumor environment, CD4/CD8 subsets, CAR T cells differentiation and exhaustion. Of note, among these influence factors, CAR T cells differentiation and exhaustion are identified as the central part due to the fact that almost all factors eventually alter the state of cells differentiation and exhaustion. Moreover, we review the potential coping strategies aiming at these limitations throughout this study.","['Zhang, Hao', 'Zhao, Pu', 'Huang, He']","['Zhang H', 'Zhao P', 'Huang H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2723-1621'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201202,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'Differentiation', 'Exhaustion', 'Persistence', 'Relapse']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:46'],"['2020/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:46 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-020-00190-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s40164-020-00190-2 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2020 Dec 2;9(1):34. doi: 10.1186/s40164-020-00190-2.,,,"['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China. huanghe@zju.edu.cn.']",,,,,['81730008/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],PMC7709221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have revealed the unfavorable role of ROS in promoting the growth, proliferation, migration, and survival of leukemia cells. In this review study, we summarize the mechanisms of ROS production and its role in leukemogenesis, counteractive effects of antioxidants, and implicate the current ROS-dependent anticancer therapies in acute myeloid leukemia. BODY: The dysregulation of the redox system is known to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of leukemia. Leukemia cells generate high levels of ROS, which further increases the levels through extra pathways, including mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic mutation, leukemic oncogene activation, increased nicotinamide adenine phosphate hydrogen (NADPH), and cytochrome P450 activities. Aforementioned pathways once activated have shown to promote genomic instability, induce drug resistance to leukemia medical therapy, disease relapse and reduce survival period. The current standard of treatment with chemotherapy employs the pro-oxidant approach to induce apoptosis and promote tumor regression. However, this approach retains several deleterious effects on the subject resulting in degradation of the quality of life. Nevertheless, the addition of an antioxidant as an adjuvant drug to chemotherapy alleviates treatment-related toxicity, increases chemotherapeutic efficacy, and improves survival rates of a patient. CONCLUSION: Acute myeloid leukemia remains a daunting challenge to clinicians. The desire to achieve the maximum benefit of chemotherapy but also improve patient outcomes is investigated. ROS generated through several pathways promotes leukemogenesis, drug resistance, and disease relapse. Chemotherapy, the mainstay of treatment, further upregulates ROS levels. Therefore, the addition of an antioxidant to leukemia medical therapy alleviates toxicity and improves patient outcomes.","['Kaweme, Natasha Mupeta', 'Zhou, Shu', 'Changwe, Geoffrey Joseph', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Kaweme NM', 'Zhou S', 'Changwe GJ', 'Zhou F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3745-4199'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201111,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Antioxidants', 'Jab1/COPS5', 'Oncogene mutations', 'Oxidative stress', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:45'],"['2020/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-00242-z [doi]', '10.1186/s40364-020-00242-z [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 Nov 11;8(1):63. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-00242-z.,,,"['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital affiliated to Wuhan University, No. 169 Donghu road, 430071, Wuhan, P.R.

We described a 58-year-old patient who was resistant to intensive chemotherapy. This refractory AML was presented with the persistence of RUNX1, IDH1 and DNMT3A mutations. RUNX1 mutations disappeared and leukemia cutis ensued after multiple chemotherapies. Leukemia cutis exhibited NRAS mutations in addition to IDH1 and DNMT3A mutations.

Unexpectedly, BM blasts obtained the new NRAS mutations after VA treatment, and consequently experienced leukostasis with two distinct leukemia clones. After survival of 230 days, this patient died because of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. This case highlights presentation of leukemia cutis with simultaneous mutations of IDH1, DNMT3A and NRAS in AML patients might act as a resistant niche to avoid the toxicity of multiple drugs including VA. There is unmet need to validate this result in the clinical trials or a large cohort of patients in the future.","['Wang, JingHan', 'Ye, Xingnong', 'Fan, Cuihua', 'Zhou, Jie', 'Luo, Shuna', 'Jin, Jingxia', 'Chen, Dan', 'Zheng, Yan', 'Wu, Cai', 'Zhu, Xiaoqiong', 'Jin, Jie', 'Huang, Jian']","['Wang J', 'Ye X', 'Fan C', 'Zhou J', 'Luo S', 'Jin J', 'Chen D', 'Zheng Y', 'Wu C', 'Zhu X', 'Jin J', 'Huang J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8166-9915'],['eng'],['Letter'],20201125,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BCL-2 inhibitors', 'Leukemia cutis']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:45'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-00246-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s40364-020-00246-9 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 Nov 25;8(1):65. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-00246-9.,,,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, P.R.

Comprehensive epidemiological research is necessary to evaluate the global burden of CML. METHODS: All data used in our study came from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. Incidence cases, death cases, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and its corresponding age-standardized rate between 1990 to 2017 were used to describe the distribution of CML burden, according to age, sex, social-demographic index (SDI), and countries. Data about attributable risk factors contributing to CML deaths and DALYs were also extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Globally, the disease burden of CML gradually decreased from 1990 to 2017. Higher SDI countries achieved a remarkable effect on diminishing the CML burden. Conversely, due to population growth, the incidence cases, death cases, and DALYs of CML in lower SDI quintiles showed an upward trend. India had the most incidence cases and death cases of CML in the world. Additionally, smoking was the most significant attributable risk factor contributing to CML deaths and DALYs, followed by high body mass index. CONCLUSION: The disease burden of CML decreased globally, especially in higher SDI countries in the past 28 years. The increasing incidence cases and death cases were mainly observed in lower SDI countries. Additionally, strategies to control modifiable risk factors such as smoking and high body mass index might be useful in diminishing mortality and DALYs.","['Ning, Liqing', 'Hu, Chuanyu', 'Lu, Pingfan', 'Que, Yimei', 'Zhu, Xiaojian', 'Li, Dengju']","['Ning L', 'Hu C', 'Lu P', 'Que Y', 'Zhu X', 'Li D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7629-2642'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201103,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer epidemiology', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Deaths', 'Global burden', 'Incidence']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:45'],"['2020/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-020-00185-z [doi]', '10.1186/s40164-020-00185-z [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2020 Nov 3;9(1):29. doi: 10.1186/s40164-020-00185-z.,,,"['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Stomatology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. zhuxiaojian@hust.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. lidengju@163.com.']",,,,,"['81770168/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '82002893/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",PMC7607878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous diagnosis of PEComa in two siblings presented in this case allowed us to review the frequency of PEComa in this genetic syndrome previously reported, which was very little. Despite its rarity, PEComa must be considered in the differential diagnosis of new-onset liver lesions in patients who were previously diagnosed with LFS.","['Galera Lopez, Maria Del Mar', 'Marquez Rodas, Ivan', 'Agra Pujol, Carolina', 'Garcia Perez, Angela', 'Velasco Sanchez, Enrique', 'Alvarez Alvarez, Rosa']","['Galera Lopez MDM', 'Marquez Rodas I', 'Agra Pujol C', 'Garcia Perez A', 'Velasco Sanchez E', 'Alvarez Alvarez R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8824-4645'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201124,England,Clin Sarcoma Res,Clinical sarcoma research,101577890,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hepatic lesion', 'Li-Fraumeni syndrome', 'Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor', 'Sarcoma', 'p53']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:45'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13569-020-00143-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13569-020-00143-7 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Sarcoma Res. 2020 Nov 24;10(1):24. doi: 10.1186/s13569-020-00143-7.,,,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Calle Dr. Esquerdo, 46, 28007, Madrid, Spain. mariamar.galera@salud.madrid.org.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Calle Dr. Esquerdo, 46, 28007, Madrid, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Radiology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of General Surgery, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Calle Dr. Esquerdo, 46, 28007, Madrid, Spain.']",,,,,,PMC7684891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies have resulted in high cure rates of up to 90% in pediatric ALL, but the outcomes for adult patients remain suboptimal with 5-year survival rates of only 30%-40%. Current immunotherapies exploit the performance of antibodies through several different mechanisms, including naked antibodies, antibodies linked to cytotoxic agents, and T-cell re-directing antibodies. Compared with chemotherapy, the application of an antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) called inotuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed or refractory (R/R) CD22(+). ALL resulted in a complete remission (CR) rate of 81% and an overall median survival of 7.7 months with reduced toxicity. Similarly, blinatumomab, the first FDA-approved bispecific antibody (BsAb), produced a 44% complete response rate and an overall median survival of 7.7 months in a widely treated ALL population. In addition, approximately 80% of patients getting complete remission with evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) achieved a complete MRD response with the use of blinatumomab. These results highlight the great promise of antibody-based therapy for ALL. How to reasonably determine the place of antibody drugs in the treatment of ALL remains a major problem to be solved for ongoing and future researches. Meanwhile the combination of antibody-based therapy with traditional standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and HSCT is also a challenge. Here, we will review some important milestones of antibody-based therapies, including combinational strategies, and antibodies under clinical development for ALL.","['Li, Le', 'Wang, Ying']","['Li L', 'Wang Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7041-8064'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201127,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Antibody-drug conjugates', 'BiTE', 'Bispecific T cell engager', 'Bispecific antibody', 'Blinatumomab', 'T-cell redirecting antibodies', 'Trispecific antibody']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:45'],"['2020/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-020-00189-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s40164-020-00189-9 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2020 Nov 27;9(1):33. doi: 10.1186/s40164-020-00189-9.,,,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. wangying1@ihcams.ac.cn.']",,,,,"['81830005/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2019YFA0110204/National Key Research and Development Program of China', 'CIFMS 2016-I2M-1-001/CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences']",PMC7697374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of key neutrophil functions, including adhesion-dependent degranulation, are controlled by src family kinases. Dasatinib is a potent src inhibitor used in treating patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia and treatment-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We hypothesized that dasatinib would attenuate acute inflammation by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment, degranulation and endothelial cell injury, without impairing bacterial clearance, in a murine model of bacteria-induced acute lung injury. C57BL/6 mice received intratracheal Escherichia coli, and were treated with intraperitoneal dasatinib or control. Bacterial clearance, lung injury, and markers of neutrophil recruitment and degranulation were measured. Separately, human blood neutrophils were exposed to dasatinib or control, and the effects on a range of neutrophil functions assessed. RESULTS: Dasatinib was associated with a dose-dependent significant increase in E. coli in the mouse lung, accompanied by impairment of organ function, reflected in significantly increased protein leak across the alveolar-capillary membrane. However, the number of neutrophils entering the lung was unaffected, suggesting that dasatinib impairs neutrophil function independent of migration. Dasatinib did not cause direct toxicity to human neutrophils, but led to significant reductions in phagocytosis of E. coli, adhesion, chemotaxis, generation of superoxide anion and degranulation of primary and secondary granules. However, no biologically important effect of dasatinib on neutrophil degranulation was observed in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our starting hypothesis, src kinase inhibition with dasatinib had a detrimental effect on bacterial clearance in the mouse lung and therefore does not represent an attractive therapeutic strategy to treat primary infective lung inflammation. Data from human neutrophils suggest that dasatanib has inhibitory effects on a range of neutrophil functions.","['Macfarlane, James G', 'Dorward, David A', 'Ruchaud-Sparagano, Marie-Helene', 'Scott, Jonathan', 'Lucas, Christopher D', 'Rossi, Adriano G', 'Simpson, A John']","['Macfarlane JG', 'Dorward DA', 'Ruchaud-Sparagano MH', 'Scott J', 'Lucas CD', 'Rossi AG', 'Simpson AJ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2636-4526'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201030,England,J Inflamm (Lond),"Journal of inflammation (London, England)",101232234,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'Dasatinib', 'Infection', 'Neutrophil', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pneumonia', 'Src kinases']",2020/12/10 06:00,2020/12/10 06:01,['2020/12/09 05:42'],"['2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 05:42 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12950-020-00261-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12950-020-00261-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Inflamm (Lond). 2020 Oct 30;17(1):34. doi: 10.1186/s12950-020-00261-5.,,,"['Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK. jim.macfarlane@nhs.net.', ""Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK."", 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.', ""Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK."", ""Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK."", 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.']",,,,,"['WT095157/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT096497/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT094415/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/K013386/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC7597020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since this initial observation, CDK8 has been implicated as a potential driver of other cancers including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and some breast cancers. Here, we observed different biological responses to CDK8 inhibition among colon cancer cell lines and the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-468. When treated with CDK8 inhibitor 4, all treated cell lines responded with decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. In the MDA-MB-468 cell line, the decrease in cell viability was dependent on increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is not observed in the colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, increased STAT3 phosphorylation in 4 treated MDA-MB-468 cells was dependent on increased transcription factor E2F1 protein. These results are consistent with previous reports of exogenous expression of E2F1-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells.","['Spear, Jensen M', 'Lu, Zhixin', 'Russu, Wade A']","['Spear JM', 'Lu Z', 'Russu WA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7900-0200'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201204,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK8', 'E2F1', 'MDA-MB-468 cells', 'STAT3', 'breast cancer', 'piperazinylpyrimidine', 'quinazoline']",2020/12/10 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/12/09 01:02'],"['2020/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25235728 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25235728 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Dec 4;25(23). pii: molecules25235728. doi: 10.3390/molecules25235728.,20210405,,"['Department of Pharmaceutics and Medicinal Chemistry, Thomas J.

In most healthy tissues, the shift from anabolism to catabolism results in decreased glycolysis and elevated fatty acid oxidation (FAO). This change in the nutrient selected for oxidation is regulated by the glucose-fatty acid cycle, also known as the Randle cycle. Briefly, this cycle consists of a decrease in glycolysis caused by increased mitochondrial FAO in muscle as a result of elevated extracellular fatty acid availability. Closing the cycle, increased glycolysis in response to elevated extracellular glucose availability causes a decrease in mitochondrial FAO. This competition between glycolysis and FAO and its relationship with anabolism and catabolism is conserved in some cancers. Accordingly, decreasing glycolysis to lactate, even by diverting pyruvate to mitochondria, can stop proliferation. Moreover, colorectal cancer cells can effectively shift to FAO to survive both glucose restriction and increases in oxidative stress at the expense of decreasing anabolism. However, a subset of B-cell lymphomas and other cancers require a concurrent increase in mitochondrial FAO and glycolysis to support anabolism and proliferation, thus escaping the competing nature of the Randle cycle. How mitochondria are remodeled in these FAO-dependent lymphomas to preferably oxidize fat, while concurrently sustaining high glycolysis and increasing de novo fatty acid synthesis is unclear. Here, we review studies focusing on the role of mitochondrial FAO and mitochondrial-driven lipid synthesis in cancer proliferation and survival, specifically in colorectal cancer and lymphomas. We conclude that a specific metabolic liability of these FAO-dependent cancers could be a unique remodeling of mitochondrial function that licenses elevated FAO concurrent to high glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. In addition, blocking this mitochondrial remodeling could selectively stop growth of tumors that shifted to mitochondrial FAO to survive oxidative stress and nutrient scarcity.","['De Oliveira, Matheus Pinto', 'Liesa, Marc']","['De Oliveira MP', 'Liesa M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2124-8799', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5909-8570']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20201204,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATF4', '*ISR', '*cancer', '*fatty acid oxidation', '*glycolysis', '*lipogenesis', '*mitochondria']",2020/12/10 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/12/09 01:02'],"['2020/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9122600 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9122600 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Dec 4;9(12). pii: cells9122600. doi: 10.3390/cells9122600.,20210709,,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']","['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Lipids)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']","['Adipose Tissue/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', '*Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Pyruvic Acid/metabolism']",,,"['P30 DK041301/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA026914/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7761891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there is an ongoing need for novel and safe anti-leukemic agents, as no fully effective chemotherapy is available to treat this life-threatening disease. Herein, are reported the isolation, structural elucidation, and anti-leukemic evaluation of twenty-nine withanolide-type steroids (1-29) from Withania aristata. Among them, the new isolated withanolides, withaperoxidins A-D (1-4) have an unusual six-membered cyclic peroxide moiety on the withasteroid skeleton as a structural novelty. Their structures have been elucidated by means of spectroscopic analyses, including 2D NMR experiments. In addition, extensive structure-activity relationships and in silico ADME studies were employed to understand the pharmacophore and pharmacokinetic properties of this series of withasteroids. Compounds 15, 16, and 22 together with withaferin A (14) were identified as having improved antiproliferative effect (IC50 ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 muM) on human leukemia HL-60 cell lines compared with the reference drug, etoposide. This cytotoxic potency was also coupled with good selectivity index (SI 33.0-9.2) on non-tumoral Vero cell line and in silico drug likeness. These findings revealed that these natural withasteroids are potential candidates as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of leukemia.","['Moujir, Laila M', 'Llanos, Gabriel G', 'Araujo, Liliana', 'Amesty, Angel', 'Bazzocchi, Isabel L', 'Jimenez, Ignacio A']","['Moujir LM', 'Llanos GG', 'Araujo L', 'Amesty A', 'Bazzocchi IL', 'Jimenez IA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7698-2704', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0641-607X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201205,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Withania aristata', 'anti-leukemia activity', 'drug-likeness prediction', 'structure-activity relationship', 'withasteroids']",2020/12/10 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/12/09 01:01'],"['2020/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25235744 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25235744 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Dec 5;25(23). pii: molecules25235744. doi: 10.3390/molecules25235744.,20210414,,"['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, Cell Biology and Genetic, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad de La Laguna, Avenida Astrofisico Francisco Sanchez s/n, 38206 La Laguna, Spain.', 'Institute of Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez and Organic Chemistry Department, Universidad de La Laguna, Avenida Astrofisico Francisco Sanchez 2, 38206 La Laguna, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, Cell Biology and Genetic, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad de La Laguna, Avenida Astrofisico Francisco Sanchez s/n, 38206 La Laguna, Spain.', 'Clinical Laboratory Career, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo, Avenida Antonio Jose de Sucre, Riobamba 060150, Ecuador.', 'Institute of Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez and Organic Chemistry Department, Universidad de La Laguna, Avenida Astrofisico Francisco Sanchez 2, 38206 La Laguna, Spain.', 'Institute of Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez and Organic Chemistry Department, Universidad de La Laguna, Avenida Astrofisico Francisco Sanchez 2, 38206 La Laguna, Spain.', 'Institute of Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez and Organic Chemistry Department, Universidad de La Laguna, Avenida Astrofisico Francisco Sanchez 2, 38206 La Laguna, Spain.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (Withanolides)', 'L6DO3QW4K5 (withaferin A)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Steroids/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vero Cells', 'Withania/*chemistry', 'Withanolides/*pharmacology']",,,,PMC7731379,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most frequent childhood malignancy, these technologies have enabled to characterize the genomic landscape of the disease and have significantly improved the survival rates of ALL patients. Despite this, adverse reactions from treatment such as toxicity, drug resistance and secondary tumors formation are still serious consequences of chemotherapy, and the main obstacles to reduce ALL-related mortality. It is well known that germline variants and somatic mutations in genes involved in drug metabolism impact the efficacy of drugs used in oncohematological diseases therapy. So far, a broader spectrum of clinically actionable alterations that seems to be crucial for the progression and treatment response have been identified. Although these results are promising, it is necessary to put this knowledge into the clinics to help physician make medical decisions and generate an impact in patients' health. This review summarizes the gene variants and clinically actionable mutations that modify the efficacy of antileukemic drugs. Therefore, knowing their genetic status before treatment is critical to reduce severe adverse effects, toxicities and life-threatening consequences in ALL patients.","['Barcenas-Lopez, Diego Alberto', 'Mendiola-Soto, Diana Karen', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo', 'Jimenez-Morales, Silvia']","['Barcenas-Lopez DA', 'Mendiola-Soto DK', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Hidalgo-Miranda A', 'Jimenez-Morales S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201205,United States,Transl Oncol,Translational oncology,101472619,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Personalized medicine', 'Pharmacogenes', 'Polymorphisms', 'Treatment response']",2020/12/09 06:00,2020/12/09 06:01,['2020/12/08 20:11'],"['2020/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/09 06:01 [medline]', '2020/12/08 20:11 [entrez]']","['S1936-5233(20)30470-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100978 [doi]']",ppublish,Transl Oncol. 2021 Jan;14(1):100978. doi: 10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100978.

Recently, more studies have focused on lower doses of irradiation on different tissues, due to the increasing exposure caused by medical imaging, radiotherapy or plane travelling for instance. Hence, we will delineate similarities and discrepancies in HSC response to high and low doses of irradiation from these studies.","['Henry, Elia', 'Arcangeli, Marie-Laure']","['Henry E', 'Arcangeli ML']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201205,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,,2020/12/09 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/12/08 20:08'],"['2020/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/08 20:08 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(20)30660-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2020.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2021 Feb;94:11-19. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2020.12.001.

ML algorithms can deal with vast amounts of medical data and provide a better understanding of malignant disease. Its ability to process information from different diagnostic modalities and functions to predict prognosis and suggest therapeutic strategies indicates that ML is a promising tool for the future management of hematologic malignancies; acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a model disease of various recent studies. An integration of these ML techniques into various applications in AML management can assure fast and accurate diagnosis as well as precise risk stratification and optimal therapy. Nevertheless, these techniques come with various pitfalls and need a strict regulatory framework to ensure safe use of ML. This comprehensive review highlights and discusses recent advances in ML techniques in the management of AML as a model disease of hematologic neoplasms, enabling researchers and clinicians alike to critically evaluate this upcoming, potentially practice-changing technology.","['Eckardt, Jan-Niklas', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Wendt, Karsten', 'Middeke, Jan Moritz']","['Eckardt JN', 'Bornhauser M', 'Wendt K', 'Middeke JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/09 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/08 17:18'],"['2020/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 17:18 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)32034-6 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002997 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 8;4(23):6077-6085. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002997.,20210514,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases, Dresden (NCT/UCC), Dresden, Germany.', 'German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'Institute of Circuits and Systems, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.']",,"['Algorithms', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Prognosis']",,,,PMC7724910,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated cyclosporine-A/mycophenolate mofetil-based intermediate intensity (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg, fludarabine 150 mg/m2, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, total body irradiation 400 cGy) unmanipulated double-unit CBT (dCBT) with prioritization of unit quality and CD34+ cell dose in graft selection. Ninety adults (median age, 47 years [range, 21-63]; median hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index, 2 [range, 0-8]; 61 [68%] acute leukemia) received double-unit grafts (median CD34+ cell dose, 1.3 x 105/kg per unit [range, 0.2-8.3]; median donor-recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match, 5/8 [range 3-7/8]). The cumulative incidences of sustained CB engraftment, day 180 grade III-IV acute, and 3-year chronic graft-versus-host disease were 99%, 24%, and 7%, respectively. Three-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) and relapse incidences were 15% and 9%, respectively. Three-year overall survival (OS) is 82%, and progression-free survival (PFS) is 76%. Younger age and higher engrafting unit CD34+ cell dose both improved TRM and OS, although neither impacted PFS. Engrafting unit-recipient HLA match was not associated with any outcome with a 3-year PFS of 79% in 39 patients engrafting with 3-4/8 HLA-matched units. In 52 remission acute leukemia patients, there was no association between minimal residual disease (MRD) and 3-year PFS: MRD negative of 88% vs MRD positive of 77% (P = .375). Intermediate intensity dCBT is associated with high PFS. Use of highly HLA mismatched and unmanipulated grafts permits wide application of this therapy, and the low relapse rates support robust graft-versus-leukemia effects even in patients with MRD.","['Barker, Juliet N', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Naputo, Kristine A', 'Skinner, Kelcey', 'Maloy, Molly A', 'Flynn, Lisa', 'Anagnostou, Theodora', 'Avecilla, Scott T', 'Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Cho, Christina', 'Dahi, Parastoo B', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Gyurkocza, Boglarka', 'Hanash, Alan M', 'Hsu, Katharine', 'Jakubowski, Ann A', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza B', 'Peled, Jonathan U', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Sauter, Craig S', 'Shah, Gunjan L', 'Shaffer, Brian C', 'Tamari, Roni', 'Young, James W', 'Roshal, Mikhail', ""O'Reilly, Richard J"", 'Ponce, Doris M', 'Politikos, Ioannis']","['Barker JN', 'Devlin SM', 'Naputo KA', 'Skinner K', 'Maloy MA', 'Flynn L', 'Anagnostou T', 'Avecilla ST', 'Scaradavou A', 'Cho C', 'Dahi PB', 'Giralt SA', 'Gyurkocza B', 'Hanash AM', 'Hsu K', 'Jakubowski AA', 'Papadopoulos EB', 'Peled JU', 'Perales MA', 'Sauter CS', 'Shah GL', 'Shaffer BC', 'Tamari R', 'Young JW', 'Roshal M', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Ponce DM', 'Politikos I']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/09 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/08 17:18'],"['2020/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 17:18 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)32033-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003371 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 8;4(23):6064-6076. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003371.,20210514,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, MSK Kids, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;

For patients with metastatic melanoma, immunotherapy with checkpoint blocking antibodies is a standard of care. In patients with concomitant CLL and metastatic melanoma, it is not known whether CLL might influence the antimelanoma efficacy or immune-related toxicities of immune checkpoint blockade. Fifteen patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma and a concomitant diagnosis of CLL who received pembrolizumab or ipilimumab with or without nivolumab for the treatment of their melanoma at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2017, were retrospectively identified. Clinical characteristics including absolute lymphocyte counts during therapy were recorded along with a response to treatment (objective radiographic response, progression-free survival, and adverse events) for each patient. Of 9 response-evaluable patients treated with ipilimumab, 3 (33%) had a partial response, 1 (11%) had stable disease, and 5 (56%) developed progressive disease. Objective tumor responses were also observed with single-agent therapy pembrolizumab and with combination therapy of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed in 6 of 15 patients (40%), including diarrhea, transaminitis, rash, and hemolytic anemia. Although our retrospective assessment was limited, there was no evidence that CLL responded to the checkpoint blockade. This case series demonstrates that ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and combined ipilimumab and nivolumab therapies show clinical activity in patients with melanoma and concomitant CLL, at rates consistent with those previously reported. This population may warrant closer surveillance for hematologic immune-related toxicities such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia.","['Smithy, James W', 'Pianko, Matthew J', 'Maher, Colleen', 'Postow, Michael A', 'Shoushtari, Alexander N', 'Momtaz, Parisa', 'Chapman, Paul B', 'Wolchok, Jedd D', 'Park, Jae H', 'Callahan, Margaret K']","['Smithy JW', 'Pianko MJ', 'Maher C', 'Postow MA', 'Shoushtari AN', 'Momtaz P', 'Chapman PB', 'Wolchok JD', 'Park JH', 'Callahan MK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,,,2020/12/09 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/12/08 17:17'],"['2020/12/08 17:17 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000345 [doi]', '00002371-202101000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2021 Jan;44(1):9-15. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000345.,20211126,,"['Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Ludwig Collaborative and Swim Across America Laboratory.', 'Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Ludwig Collaborative and Swim Across America Laboratory.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Ludwig Collaborative and Swim Across America Laboratory.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (Ipilimumab)', '31YO63LBSN (Nivolumab)', 'DPT0O3T46P (pembrolizumab)']","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/etiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Ipilimumab/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nivolumab/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002384/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000457/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7727280,,['NIHMS1638461'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, the function of circRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are not yet clarified. In this analysis, hsa_circ_0079480, a novel circRNA, has been identified as being highly expressed in AML. Loss-of-function assays showed that reduction of hsa_circ_0079480 decreased the growth and stimulated apoptosis of AML cells in vitro. Furthermore, miR-654-3p was sponged by hsa_circ_0079480, and hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) was targeted by miR-654-3p with respect to the fundamental mechanism. Moreover, the influence on growth and apoptosis of AML cells stimulated by hsa_circ_0079480 inhibition can be rescued by miR-654-3p inhibitor or HDGF overexpression.

A subset of ERVs share high nucleotide similarity to circulating horizontally transmitted exogenous retrovirus (XRV) progenitors. In these cases, ERV-XRV interactions have been documented and include (a) recombination to result in ERV-XRV chimeras, (b) ERV induction of immune self-tolerance to XRV antigens, (c) ERV antigen interference with XRV receptor binding, and (d) interactions resulting in both enhancement and restriction of XRV infections. Whereas the mechanisms governing recombination and immune self-tolerance have been partially determined, enhancement and restriction of XRV infection are virus specific and only partially understood.

The selective targeting of drivers in LSCs with small molecule inhibitors holds promise for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Recently, we reported the identification of inhibitors of the histone lysine demethylase JMJD1C that preferentially kill MLL rearranged acute leukemia cells. Here, we report the identification of jumonji domain modulator #7 (JDM-7). Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that JDM-7 binds to JMJD1C and its family homolog JMJD1B. JDM-7 did not significantly suppress cell proliferation in liquid cell culture at higher doses, although it led to a significant decrease in semi-solid colony formation experiments at lower concentrations. Moreover, low doses of JDM-7 did not suppress the proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells. We identified that JDM-7 downregulates the LSC self-renewal gene HOXA9 in leukemia cells. We further found that the structure of JDM-7 is similar to that of tadalafil, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that tadalafil binds to JMJD1C. Moreover, similar to JDM-7, tadalafil suppressed colony formation of leukemia cells in semi-solid cell culture at a concentration that did not affect primary umbilical cord blood cells. In summary, we have identified JDM-7 and tadalafil as potential JMJD1C modulators that selectively inhibit the growth of LSCs.","['Yang, Yong', 'Zhang, Xinjing', 'Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Wang, Yishu', 'Wang, Xintong', 'Hu, Linda', 'Zhao, Yao', 'Wang, Haihua', 'Wang, Zhanju', 'Wang, Haiying', 'Wang, Lin', 'Dirks, Wilhelm G', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Xu, Xin', 'Hu, Zhenbo']","['Yang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang X', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X', 'Hu L', 'Zhao Y', 'Wang H', 'Wang Z', 'Wang H', 'Wang L', 'Dirks WG', 'Drexler HG', 'Xu X', 'Hu Z']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8288-9047', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6523-7397']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201216,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*JMJD1B', '*JMJD1C', '*histone demethylases', '*leukemic stem cells', '*small molecular compounds']",2020/12/09 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/08 05:49'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/08 05:49 [entrez]']",['10.1002/2211-5463.13054 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2021 Jan;11(1):265-277. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.13054.

Human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells (HL60) and murine AML cells (L1210) treated with SEP were used to assess viability using Cell Counting Kit-8, cytotoxicity by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by DCFH-DA staining. In addition, we utilized a mouse model of leukaemia in which L1210 cells were injected into DBA/2 mice by sub-axillary injection. Treatment with SEP decreased cell viability, increased in cytotoxicity and increased the release of ROS in a dose-dependent manner. SEP treatment was also associated with the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Activation of the apoptotic pathway led to the release of cytochrome C (CytoC) into the cytosol of the cell resulting in decreased membrane potential. The effect of SEP treatment was depended on the activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway as SEP treatment led to an increase in NF-kappaB phosphorylation, and inhibition of NF-kappaB signalling using PDTC blocked SEP-mediated activation of apoptosis. Treatment with SEP also prolonged survival time in our leukaemia mouse model and was associated with diminished tumour volume, increased leucocyte and lymphocyte proliferation, promoted pro-inflammatory factor release in serum and enhanced immune function. Taken together, these data suggest that SEP inhibits the progression of leukaemia by initiating mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, and apoptosis via the NF-kappaB signalling pathway.","['Wang, Chong', 'Li, Mengya', 'Li, Lingling', 'Shen, Xiaohui', 'Liu, Yanfang', 'Wang, Shujuan']","['Wang C', 'Li M', 'Li L', 'Shen X', 'Liu Y', 'Wang S']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5965-0716', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4062-3096']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB', 'SEP', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'leukaemia', 'mitochondria']",2020/12/09 06:00,2020/12/09 06:00,['2020/12/08 05:49'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 05:49 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcmm.15995 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Dec 1. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.15995.,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Except with the promyelocytic leukemia cell supernatants (HL-60), the other two tumor supernatants (chronic myeloid leukemia, K562 and Burkitt lymphoma, DAUDI) increased both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production by monocytes and monocytes undergoing differentiation. This effect was neither explained by alterations of cell number in culture nor by the high amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) present in the tumor supernatants.

Adults (aged 18-70 years) who received alloHSCT in first complete remission, had achieved hematologic recovery, and were transfusion independent were randomized to receive SOC with or without midostaurin (50 mg twice daily) continuously in twelve 4-week cycles. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) 18 months post-alloHSCT. Sixty patients were randomized (30/arm); 30 completed all 12 cycles (midostaurin + SOC, n = 16; SOC, n = 14). The estimated 18-month RFS (95% CI) was 89% (69-96%) in the midostaurin arm and 76% (54-88%) in the SOC arm (hazard ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.12-1.86]; P = 0.27); estimated relapse rates were 11% and 24%, respectively. Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation to <70% of baseline (achieved by 50% of midostaurin-treated patients) was associated with improved RFS. The most common serious adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Rates of graft-vs-host disease were similar between both arms (midostaurin + SOC, 70%; SOC, 73%). The addition of midostaurin maintenance therapy following alloHSCT may provide clinical benefit in some patients with FLT3-ITD AML.

The antimalarial, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) translationally represses MCL-1 and synergizes with BH3-mimetics. To explore how DHA represses MCL-1, a genome-wide CRISPR screen identified that loss of genes in the heme synthesis pathway renders mouse BCR-ABL(+) B-ALL cells resistant to DHA-induced death. Mechanistically, DHA disrupts the interaction between heme and the eIF2alpha kinase heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) triggering the integrated stress response. Genetic ablation of Eif2ak1, which encodes HRI, blocks MCL-1 repression in response to DHA treatment and represses the synergistic killing of DHA and BH3-mimetics compared with wild-type leukemia. Furthermore, BTdCPU, a small-molecule activator of HRI, similarly triggers MCL-1 repression and synergizes with BH3-mimetics in mouse and human leukemia including both Ph(+) and Ph-like B-ALL. Finally, combinatorial treatment of leukemia bearing mice with both BTdCPU and a BH3-mimetic extended survival and repressed MCL-1 in vivo. These findings reveal for the first time that the HRI-dependent cellular heme-sensing pathway can modulate apoptosis in leukemic cells by repressing MCL-1 and increasing their responsiveness to BH3-mimetics. This signaling pathway could represent a generalizable mechanism for repressing MCL-1 expression in malignant cells and sensitizing them to available therapeutics. IMPLICATIONS: The HRI-dependent cellular heme-sensing pathway can modulate apoptotic sensitivity in leukemic cells by repressing antiapoptotic MCL-1 and increasing their responsiveness to BH3-mimetics.","['Smith, Kaitlyn H', 'Budhraja, Amit', 'Lynch, John', 'Roberts, Kathryn', 'Panetta, John C', 'Connelly, Jon P', 'Turnis, Meghan E', 'Pruett-Miller, Shondra M', 'Schuetz, John D', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Opferman, Joseph T']","['Smith KH', 'Budhraja A', 'Lynch J', 'Roberts K', 'Panetta JC', 'Connelly JP', 'Turnis ME', 'Pruett-Miller SM', 'Schuetz JD', 'Mullighan CG', 'Opferman JT']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7626-4043', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5564-1775', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3793-585X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1850']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201207,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,,,2020/12/09 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2020/12/08 05:39'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/08 05:39 [entrez]']","['1541-7786.MCR-20-0586 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0586 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2021 Apr;19(4):636-650. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0586.

Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is a rare and aggressive disease that occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate is high and therefore, accurate and early diagnosis is essential. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis among pediatric oncohematological patients and characterize them with confirmed diagnoses. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that analyzed the medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with oncohematological diseases and suspected fungal infections, who were included after obtaining informed consent, from January to December 2017, in the pediatric unit of a tertiary university hospital. Data collected from medical record analysis included the following: underlying diagnosis, absolute neutrophil count, clinical presentation, culture and biopsy results, surgical procedures performed, survival and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were evaluated, with three suspected cases of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. Histopathological and microbiological analyses confirmed two cases. In both cases, the pathogen isolated in the culture was Fusarium sp. The two confirmed cases were female, aged 12 and 14 years, both with an absolute neutrophil count of 10cells/muL. The underlying disease of the first patient was acute myeloid leukemia (subtype M5), whereas the second patient presented idiopathic bone marrow aplasia. CONCLUSION: Both confirmed cases of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis presented with constitutional symptoms and signs of nasal and sinusital inflammation. This demonstrates the importance of fever as a symptom in immunocompromised patients and it should prompt otorhinolaryngological investigation.","['Rodrigues, Lorrane Caroline Braga', 'Guimaraes, Alessandro Fernandes', 'de Oliveira, Isamara Simas', 'de Sousa, Pedro Henrique Medici', 'de Castro Romanelli, Roberta Maia', 'Kakehasi, Fabiana Maria', 'de Sa Rodrigues, Karla Emilia']","['Rodrigues LCB', 'Guimaraes AF', 'de Oliveira IS', 'de Sousa PHM', 'de Castro Romanelli RM', 'Kakehasi FM', 'de Sa Rodrigues KE']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201109,Brazil,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,"Hematology, transfusion and cell therapy",101725732,,['NOTNLM'],"['Febrile neutropenia', 'Fusarium', 'Hematologic diseases', 'Invasive fungal infection', 'Pediatrics']",2020/12/09 06:00,2020/12/09 06:00,['2020/12/08 05:38'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S2531-1379(20)31283-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.htct.2020.08.016 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther. 2020 Nov 9. pii: S2531-1379(20)31283-9. doi: 10.1016/j.htct.2020.08.016.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

This experiment was set up to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of Dendrobium polysaccharide on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced damage to the human brain microvascular endothelial cells. For this purpose, human brain microvascular endothelial cells HBMEC were divided into control group (without any treatment), ox-LDL group (50 mug/mL ox-LDL), Dendrobium polysaccharide low, medium and high concentration group (0.1 mug/L, 0.2 mug/L, 0.4 mug/L Dendrobium polysaccharide+50 mug/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+miR-NC group (transfection miR-378 mimic negative control+50 mug/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+miR-378 group (transfected miR-378 mimics+50 mug/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+DP+anti-miR-NC group (transfected miR-378 inhibitor negative control +0.4 mug/L Dendrobium polysaccharide+50 mug/mL ox-LDL), ox-LDL+DP+anti-miR-378 group (transfected miR-378 inhibitor+0.4 mug/L Dendrobium polysaccharide+50 mug/mL ox-LDL ). The kit was used to detect the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT); flow cytometry to detect apoptosis; and Western blot to detect B-cell lymph tumor/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 related X (Bax) protein expression; real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-378. Results showed that after treatment with different concentrations of Dendrobium polysaccharides, MDA levels were decreased in ox-LDL-induced human brain microvascular endothelial cells, SOD and CAT activities were increased, apoptosis rate was decreased, Bcl-2 expression was increased, Bax expression was decreased, miR-378 expression was increased, in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.05).

With two FLT3 inhibitors recently approved by the FDA (midostaurin and gilteritinib), there is a need to evaluate these targeted agents. PURPOSE: To assess the clinical effectiveness of FLT3 inhibitors in AML patients. METHODS: Standard systematic review methods were utilised. Searches were conducted to July 2020 for completed and in-progress randomised controlled trials of FLT3 inhibitors in AML. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Eight completed trials involving 2656 patients and assessing five different FLT3 inhibitors (sorafenib, lestaurtinib, midostaurin, gilteritinib and quizartinib) were included. The pooled results were as follows (FLT3 inhibitor/control): overall survival hazard ratio (HR) = 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.92, p = 0.0005), event-free survival HR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.94, p = 0.002), relapse-free survival HR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.90, p = 0.001), complete remission relative risk (RR) = 1.11 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.22. p = 0.05) and 60-day mortality RR = 1.04 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.40, p = 0.79). Relative risk of grade 3 and above vascular, dermatological, respiratory and hepatobiliary adverse events were found to be statistically significantly higher in the FLT3 inhibitor group compared to control, but the actual numbers of events were relatively small. Nineteen ongoing trials are still in progress, only one of which specifically targets older patients with AML. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to support the use of FLT3 inhibitors in patients with AML, but more data is needed to verify the optimum use of the drugs regarding type of inhibitor, disease stage and patient characteristics, not only in relation to disease control, but adverse events and quality of life. There are a large number of ongoing trials; therefore, the results of this review are not a fait accompli; thus, is it recommended that the review be updated in a couple of years' time. Given the challenges in extracting the complete data set required to assess clinical effectiveness, it is highly recommended that ongoing and future trials improve transparency and consistency of reporting of all trial outcomes, particularly disease control and adverse events, to enable a global clinical effectiveness assessment.

METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 91 pediatric ALL patients who underwent PEG-asp-contained treatment on the 7th day after drug administration. Plasma L-asp activity, anti-L-asp antibody level, asparagine level and glutamine level were detected. Meanwhile, AEs related to PEG-asp administration were recorded. RESULTS: AEs occurred in 13 (14.3%) patients, among which 7 (7.7%) patients had anaphylaxis, while another 6 patients had non-anaphylaxis AEs (including 4 (4.4%) patients who had acute pancreatitis, 1 (1.1%) patient who had abdominal pain and diarrhea, as well as 1 (1.1%) patient who had nausea and vomiting). L-asp activity was decreased, while asparagine and glutamine levels were increased in patients with AEs compared to patients without AEs, and ROC curves showed that they were correlated with higher AEs risk. Notably, further analyses revealed that L-asp activity, anti-L-asp antibody, asparagine and glutamine levels were highly correlated with anaphylaxis risk, but they were not associated with the risk of non-anaphylactic AEs. CONCLUSION: The measurement of L-asp activity, anti-L-asp antibody level, asparagine level and glutamine level might assist the prevention of anaphylaxis-related AEs in pediatric ALL patients who underwent PEG-asp-contained treatment.","['Wu, Juan', 'Chen, Changcheng', 'Huang, Shiying', 'Shen, Shuhong', 'Chen, Jing', 'Zhang, Shunguo']","['Wu J', 'Chen C', 'Huang S', 'Shen S', 'Chen J', 'Zhang S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0891-7123'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*L-asparaginase activity', '*adverse events', '*anaphylaxis', '*pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*polyethylene glycol-conjugated L-asparaginase']",2020/12/09 06:00,2021/11/23 06:00,['2020/12/08 05:30'],"['2020/12/08 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820980113 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820980113. doi: 10.1177/1533033820980113.,20211122,,"[""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']","['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anaphylaxis/*blood/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood', 'Asparagine/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*blood/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Glutamine/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve']",,,,PMC7727045,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It regulates a broad spectrum of cellular responses including hematopoiesis. In order to process TGF-beta1-responses in time and space in an appropriate manner, there is a tight regulation of its signaling at diverse steps. The downstream signaling is mediated by type I and type II receptors and modulated by the 'accessory' receptor Endoglin also termed cluster of differentiation 105 (CD105). Endoglin was initially identified on pre-B leukemia cells but has received most attention due to its high expression on activated endothelial cells. In turn, Endoglin has been figured out as the causative factor for diseases associated with vascular dysfunction like hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-1 (HHT-1), pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUPR). Because HHT patients often show signs of inflammation at vascular lesions, and loss of Endoglin in the myeloid lineage leads to spontaneous inflammation, it is speculated that Endoglin impacts inflammatory processes. In line, Endoglin is expressed on progenitor/precursor cells during hematopoiesis as well as on mature, differentiated cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, so far only pro-monocytes and macrophages have been in the focus of research, although Endoglin has been identified in many other immune system cell subsets. These findings imply a functional role of Endoglin in the maturation and function of immune cells. Aside the functional relevance of Endoglin in endothelial cells, CD105 is differentially expressed during hematopoiesis, arguing for a role of this receptor in the development of individual cell lineages. In addition, Endoglin expression is present on mature immune cells of the innate (i.e., macrophages and mast cells) and the adaptive (i.e., T-cells) immune system, further suggesting Endoglin as a factor that shapes immune responses. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on Endoglin expression and function in hematopoietic precursors and mature hematopoietic cells of different lineages.","['Meurer, Steffen K', 'Weiskirchen, Ralf']","['Meurer SK', 'Weiskirchen R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0821-441X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3888-0931']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201203,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CD105', 'Endoglin', 'TGF-beta-signaling', 'adaptive immunity', 'hematopoiesis', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'innate immunity']",2020/12/09 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/12/08 01:08'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 01:08 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21239247 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21239247 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 3;21(23). pii: ijms21239247. doi: 10.3390/ijms21239247.,20210308,,"['Institute of Molecular Pathobiochemistry, Experimental Gene Therapy and Clinical Chemistry (IFMPEGKC), RWTH University Hospital Aachen, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Pathobiochemistry, Experimental Gene Therapy and Clinical Chemistry (IFMPEGKC), RWTH University Hospital Aachen, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['0 (Endoglin)'],"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Endoglin/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*etiology/*metabolism']",,,"['SFB/TRR57; WE 2554/15-1; ME 3431/2-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'O3-1/Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research within the Faculty of', 'Medicine at the RWTH Aachen University']",PMC7729465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given their remarkable efficacy in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other CD19-expressing B cell malignancies, there is hope adoptive cellular transfer, particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified immune effector cell (IEC) therapies, may afford a novel, potent immune-based approach for the treatment of AML that complements or replaces existing ones and improves cure rates. However, it is unclear how best to translate the success of these therapies from B cell malignancies, where use of highly potent immunotherapies is facilitated by identified target antigens with near ubiquitous expression on malignant cells and non-fatal consequences from ""on-target, off-tumor cell"" toxicities. Herein, we review the current status of CAR-modified IEC therapies for AML, with considerations regarding suitable, relatively leukemia-restricted target antigens, expected toxicities, and interactions of the engineered cells with a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that restricts their therapeutic efficacy. With these challenges in mind, we will discuss possible strategies to improve the cells' potency as well as their therapeutic window for optimal clinical use in AML.","['Acharya, Utkarsh H', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Acharya UH', 'Walter RB']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9268-3341'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201203,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'adoptive cell transfer', 'antigen', 'antitumor efficacy', 'chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', 'microenvironment', 'natural killer cell', 'resistance', 'safety']",2020/12/09 06:00,2020/12/09 06:01,['2020/12/08 01:07'],"['2020/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 01:07 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/09 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123617 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123617 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 3;12(12). pii: cancers12123617. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123617.,,,"['Divisions of Hematologic Malignancies & Immune Effector Cell Therapy, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",,,,,,PMC7761730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high incidence of APL in the Hispanics suggests an association with genetic variants in this population. Information on second primary malignancies (SPMs) in patients with APL is limited. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to interrogate whether the rate of SPMs in patients with APL was associated with ethnicity and/or ATRA treatment. Between 2000 and 2016, 116 cases of SPM were diagnosed among 4019 patients with APL. The mean age at diagnosis of primary APL was 53.9 years (+/-15.7 years), and the mean age at diagnosis of SPMs was 59.0 years (+/-14.5 years). Comparisons with 3774 APL survivors who did not develop SPMs revealed that age >/=40 years at diagnosis of APL (p < 0.001) and non-Hispanic white ethnicity (p = 0.025) were associated with SPMs in APL survivors. Salivary gland, liver, and soft tissue malignancies were significantly more common in patients with primary APL than in individuals with non-APL malignancies. A risk analysis comparing patients who had APL with patients who had non-APL AML suggests that SPMs after APL is associated with ATRA treatment. Therefore, patient follow-up after APL should focus on early diagnosis of SPMs.","['Lenzi, Luana', 'Lee-Jones, Lisa', 'Mostofa, Maruf A', 'de Andrade, Diancarlos P', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Figueiredo, Bonald C']","['Lenzi L', 'Lee-Jones L', 'Mostofa MA', 'de Andrade DP', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Figueiredo BC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4829-1703', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1255-3545', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1512-6725', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0880-898X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9956-5647']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201203,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATRA', 'acute promyelocytic', 'chemotherapy', 'leukemia']",2020/12/09 06:00,2020/12/09 06:01,['2020/12/08 01:06'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 01:06 [entrez]', '2020/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/09 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12123610 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12123610 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Dec 3;12(12). pii: cancers12123610. doi: 10.3390/cancers12123610.,,,"['Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Parana 80210-170, Brazil.', 'Life Sciences Department, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester M1 5GD, UK.', 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Parana 80250-060, Brazil.', 'Life Sciences Department, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester M1 5GD, UK.', 'Life Sciences Department, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester M1 5GD, UK.', 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Parana 80250-060, Brazil.', 'Pele Pequeno Principe Research Institute, Faculdades Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Parana 80230-020, Brazil.', ""Leukemia and Lymphoma Division, Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Parana 80250-060, Brazil.', 'Pele Pequeno Principe Research Institute, Faculdades Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Parana 80230-020, Brazil.', 'Centro de Genetica Molecular e Pesquisa do Cancer em Criancas (CEGEMPAC), Curitiba, Parana 80030-110, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Saude Coletiva, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Parana 80060-240, Brazil.']",,,,,,PMC7761603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) has been shown to be critical in orchestration of infiltration of AML cells into the CNS in animal models, however it is unknown if an association exists between LILRB4 and CNS involvement (CNS+) in human patients with AML. LILRB4 was measured by flow cytometry in a heterogeneous population of fifty-six AML patients. Patients were then followed clinically for the development of CNS + . LILRB4 was positive in 91 % of patients with CNS + compared to 38 % without CNS involvement (p < 0.002). In logistic analysis: age, BMI, serum albumin and positive LILRB4 were predictive for CNS+ [OR, 95 % CI, p-value]: 0.95, 0.92-0.99, p < 0.01; 0.85, 0.73-0.998, p < 0.05; 0.23, 0.066-0.78, p < 0.02; 16.46, 1.93-140.2, p < 0.02, respectively. This finding of the association of LILRB4 with CNS + in combination with earlier findings suggests that LILRB4 has a mechanistic role in infiltration of the CNS and may provide insight into the pathogenesis of AML seeding the CNS. Moreover, this proof of concept and the findings in the present study may lead to the development of innovative and novel therapies to improve the lives of patients with AML.","['Bergstrom, Colin P', 'Dahiya, Saurabh', 'Chen, Weina', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng', 'Zhu, Hong', 'Yan, Jingsheng', 'Madanat, Yazan', 'Patel, Prapti', 'Vusirkala, Madhuri', 'Ramakrishnan, Praveen', 'Rizvi, Syed', 'Chung, Stephen', 'Awan, Farrukh', 'Anderson, Larry D Jr', 'Collins, Robert', 'Kansagra, Ankit']","['Bergstrom CP', 'Dahiya S', 'Chen W', 'Zhang CC', 'Zhu H', 'Yan J', 'Madanat Y', 'Patel P', 'Vusirkala M', 'Ramakrishnan P', 'Rizvi S', 'Chung S', 'Awan F', 'Anderson LD Jr', 'Collins R', 'Kansagra A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201122,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Clinical results', '*Molecular genetics', '*Myeloid leukemias and dysplasias', '*Prognostication']",2020/12/08 06:00,2021/03/12 06:00,['2020/12/07 20:08'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 20:08 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(20)30185-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2020.106480 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2021 Jan;100:106480. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2020.106480.

Histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is highly expressed in many cancers, impedes the differentiation of cancer cells, promotes the proliferation, metastasis and invasion of cancer cells, and is associated with poor prognosis. Targeting LSD1 has been recognized as a promising strategy for AML treatment in recent years. Based on these features, in the review, we discussed the main epigenetic drugs targeting LSD1 for AML therapy. Thus, this review focuses on the progress of LSD1 inhibitors in AML treatment, particularly those such as tranylcypromine (TCP), ORY-1001, GSK2879552, and IMG-7289 in clinical trials. These inhibitors provide novel scaffolds for designing new LSD1 inhibitors. Besides, combined therapies of LSD1 inhibitors with other drugs for AML treatment are also highlighted.","['Zhang, Shujing', 'Liu, Menghan', 'Yao, Yongfang', 'Yu, Bin', 'Liu, Hongmin']","['Zhang S', 'Liu M', 'Yao Y', 'Yu B', 'Liu H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201204,Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML treatment', '*Combination therapy', '*Histone demethylase', '*LSD1 inhibitors', '*Tranylcypromine derivatives']",2020/12/08 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2020/12/07 20:08'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 20:08 [entrez]']","['S1043-6618(20)31643-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105335 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2021 Feb;164:105335. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105335.

Here, we discussed the predictive value of total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) measured on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in T-LBL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven treatment naive T-LBL patients with PET-CT scans were enrolled. TMTV was obtained using the 41% maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) threshold method, and TLG was measured as metabolic tumor volume multiplied by the mean SUV. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. RESULTS: The optimal cutoff values for SUVmax, TMTV, and TLG were 12.7, 302 cm3, and 890, respectively. A high SUVmax, TMTV, and TLG indicated a shorten PFS and OS. On multivariable analysis, TMTV >/= 302 cm3, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement predicted inferior PFS, while high SUVmax, TLG and CNS involvement were associated with worse OS. Subsequently, we generated a risk model comprising high SUVmax, TMTV or TLG and CNS involvement, which stratified the population into three risk groups, which had significantly different median PFS of not reached, 14 months, and 7 months for low-risk group, mediate-risk group, and high-risk group, respectively (p < 0.001). Median OS were not reached, 27 months, and 13 months, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Baseline SUVmax, TMTV, and TLG measured on PET-CT are strong predictors of worse outcome in T-LBL. A risk model integrating these three parameters with CNS involvement identifies patients at high risk of disease progression.","['Feng, Xiaoyan', 'Wen, Xin', 'Li, Ling', 'Sun, Zhenchang', 'Li, Xin', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Wu, Jingjing', 'Fu, Xiaorui', 'Wang, Xinhua', 'Yu, Hui', 'Ma, Xinran', 'Zhang, Xudong', 'Xie, Xinli', 'Han, Xingmin', 'Zhang, Mingzhi']","['Feng X', 'Wen X', 'Li L', 'Sun Z', 'Li X', 'Zhang L', 'Wu J', 'Fu X', 'Wang X', 'Yu H', 'Ma X', 'Zhang X', 'Xie X', 'Han X', 'Zhang M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201202,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Positron emission tomography-computed tomography', 'Prognosis', 'T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'Total lesion glycolysis', 'Total metabolic tumor volume']",2020/12/08 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2020/12/07 18:28'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 18:28 [entrez]']","['crt.2020.123 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2020.123 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Jul;53(3):837-846. doi: 10.4143/crt.2020.123.

Final results of the phase II pediatric-like GIMEMA LAL-1308 trial.,292-301,10.1002/ajh.26066 [doi],"Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represent a unique patient population with specific characteristics and needs. Growing evidences suggest that pediatric-inspired approaches improve the outcome in AYA. These results prompted the design of a pediatric AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000-based regimen - the GIMEMA LAL-1308 protocol - for newly diagnosed AYA (range 18-35 years) with Philadelphia negative (Ph-) ALL. The protocol included minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis at two different time-points (TP), that is, at the end of induction IA and consolidation IB, and a modulation in post-consolidation intensity according to MRD. Seventy-six patients were eligible between September 2010 and October 2014. The regimen was well tolerated, with 2.7% induction deaths and no deaths in the post-consolidation phase. The complete response (CR) rate was 92%; the 48-month overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 60.3% and 60.4%. Both OS and DFS were significantly better in T-ALL than B-ALL. A molecular MRD <10(-3) at TP1 was associated with a significantly better OS and DFS (77% vs 39% and 71.9% vs 34.4%, respectively);similar results were documented at TP2 (OS and DFS 74.5% vs 30.6% and 71.5% vs 25.7%, respectively). The LAL-1308 results were compared to those from similar historic AYA populations undergoing the two previous GIMEMA LAL-2000 and LAL-0904 protocols. Both OS and DFS improved significantly compared to the two previous protocols. These results indicate that this pediatric-inspired and MRD-oriented protocol is feasible and effective for Ph- AYA ALL patients, and underline the prognostic value of MRD determinations at specific TPs.","['Testi, Anna Maria', 'Canichella, Martina', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Starza, Irene Della', 'Cavalli, Marzia', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Messina, Monica', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Moleti, Maria Luisa', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Luppi, Mario', ""D'Aloisio, Marianna"", 'Candoni, Anna', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Foa, Roberto']","['Testi AM', 'Canichella M', 'Vitale A', 'Piciocchi A', 'Guarini A', 'Starza ID', 'Cavalli M', 'De Propris MS', 'Messina M', 'Elia L', 'Moleti ML', 'Martino B', 'Luppi M', ""D'Aloisio M"", 'Candoni A', 'Conter V', 'Fazi P', 'Vignetti M', 'Chiaretti S', 'Foa R']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2138-4894'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20201229,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,,2020/12/08 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/12/07 17:12'],"['2020/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26066 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Mar 1;96(3):292-301. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26066.

In this pediatric AEL study, we evaluated morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, molecular, and clinical data of 24 (1.2%) cases from all cases undergoing central pathology review in Children's Oncology Group trials AAML0531 and AAML1031. Of 24 cases, 5 had a pure erythroid phenotype, and 19 had an erythroid/myeloid phenotype. NUP98 fusions were highly enriched in patients with AEL, occurring in 7 of 22 cases for which molecular data were available (31.8% vs 6.7% in other AML subtypes). Of 5 cases of pure erythroid leukemias (PELs), 3 had NUP98 fusions, and 4 had complex karyotypes. Erythroid/myeloid leukemias were reclassified by using the 2017 World Health Organization hematopathology classification as: myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts-1 (n = 3), MDS with excess blasts-2 (n = 7), AML (nonerythroid, n = 5), and unknown MDS/AML (n = 4); the 5 cases of nonerythroid AML included 1 with an NUP98-NSD1 fusion, 2 with myelodysplasia-related changes, and 1 with a complex karyotype. Three cases of MDS with excess blasts-2 also had NUP98 rearrangements. WT1 mutations were present in 5 of 14 cases, all erythroid/myeloid leukemia. Outcomes assessment revealed statistically poorer overall survival (5-year, 20% +/- 36% vs 66% +/- 23%; P = .004) and event-free survival (5-year, 20% +/- 36% vs 46% +/- 23%; P = .019) for those with PEL than those with erythroid/myeloid leukemia. Our study supports that AEL is a morphologically and genetically heterogeneous entity that is enriched in NUP98 fusions, with the pure erythroid subtype associated with particularly adverse outcomes.","['Chisholm, Karen M', 'Heerema-McKenney, Amy E', 'Choi, John K', 'Smith, Jenny', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Kahwash, Samir B']","['Chisholm KM', 'Heerema-McKenney AE', 'Choi JK', 'Smith J', 'Ries RE', 'Hirsch BA', 'Raimondi SC', 'Alonzo TA', 'Wang YC', 'Aplenc R', 'Sung L', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S', 'Kahwash SB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2020/12/08 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/07 17:12'],"['2020/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/07 17:12 [entrez]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)32026-7 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002712 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 8;4(23):6000-6008. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002712.,20210514,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"[""Department of Laboratories, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Children's Mercy Hospitals & Clinics, Kansas City, MO; and."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH.""]","['0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']","['Aged', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins']",,,"['U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7724911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate whether it was possible to promote pro/pre-B cell maturation beyond this phase and make them sensitive to imatinib treatment by overexpressing immunoregulatory tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) with BCR-ABL in a Ph+ B-ALL mouse model. MATERIALS & METHODS: Ph+ B-ALL mouse models were induced by BCR-ABL using retroviral transduction/transplantation. RESULTS: Overexpression of ITAM promoted the differentiation of blocked pro/pre-B cells to B220+IgM+ and increased disease sensitivity to imatinib in mice. Btk deficiency accelerated the progression of BCR-ABL-induced B-ALL. CONCLUSION: B-cell development blockage released by ITAM renders leukemia cells sensitive to imatinib treatment in BCR-ABL-induced B-ALL.","['Wang, Zi', 'Li, Yong', 'Lu, Xiaokai', 'Yuan, Jia', 'Qiu, Qiang', 'Pan, Cong']","['Wang Z', 'Li Y', 'Lu X', 'Yuan J', 'Qiu Q', 'Pan C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201101,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'BCR', 'BCR-ABL', ""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'imatinib', 'immunoregulatory tyrosine activation motif']",2020/12/08 06:00,2020/12/08 06:01,['2020/12/07 17:11'],"['2020/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/07 17:11 [entrez]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/08 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2020 Nov 1;13(11):2738-2745. eCollection 2020.,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2020.'],"[""Department of Oncology, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital Guiyang 550002, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital Guiyang 550002, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital Guiyang 550002, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital Guiyang 550002, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Chengdu eBond Biomedical Research Center Chengdu 610041, China.']",,,['None.'],,,PMC7716132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
