Besides being an alternative to chemotherapy and antibody-based approaches, CAR-T cells have become the first successful example of ""personalized medicine."" Areas covered: In clinical trials, tisagenlecleucel demonstrated higher response rates than prior therapies, and led to durable remissions lasting up to years for some children. Toxicities like cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, while potentially reversible, have limited usage of CAR-T cells at certified centers with expertise in cellular therapy. Strategies to deal with B-ALL relapse after CAR-T remain an open area of research. Expert opinion: Going forward, improvements will likely be seen in managing the side effects of CAR-T therapy as well as usage of CAR-T cells upfront as a replacement for chemotherapy or allogeneic bone marrow transplant for B-ALL. Further advances will need to reduce the biomanufacturing time needed to generate CAR-T cells as well as develop biomarkers that predict CAR-T persistence and/or toxicities.","['Capitini, Christian M']",['Capitini CM'],"['Department of Pediatrics and Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181008,England,Expert Opin Orphan Drugs,Expert opinion on orphan drugs,101601398,PMC6375487,"['Declaration of interest CM Capitini received honorarium for a one-time Novartis', 'advisory board in 2016 and is presently on an advisory board for Nektar', 'Therapeutics and receives honorarium.

While its potent mode of action is through incorporation into DNA as a thiol mimic of deoxyguanosine, severe toxicities are associated with its administration which hinder the potential therapeutic application. We have previously reported in vitro that the oxidative metabolites of 6TP, specifically 6-thiouric acid (6TU, K i 7 muM), are potent inhibitors of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGDH), an enzyme that is responsible for the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA), an essential substrate that is used in detoxification processes in the liver. An in vivo investigation was undertaken to probe if 6TU inhibits UDPGDH in rat hepatocytes, and it was observed that 6TU does greatly suppress the conjugation of bilirubin with UDPGA. The failed excretion of bilirubin is linked to a majority of the reported toxicities associated with 6TP administration. Efforts were undertaken for the construction of 6TP analogs, substituted at the C8 position, to reduce inhibition of UDPGDH while retaining therapeutic efficacy. Three new 6TP analogs bearing a halogen (Br, Cl, and F) at the C8 position have been achieved over five-synthetic steps in overall yields of 16 to 32%. Each of these analogs were shown to have reduced inhibition towards UDPGDH, with K i values of 192, 163, 215 muM, respectively. In addition, the bromine, chlorine, and fluorine analogs were shown to possess cytotoxicity towards the REH cell line (acute lymphocytic leukemia) having IC50 values of 9.54 muM (+/-0.97), 3.95 muM (+/-1.94), and 4.71 muM (+/-1.40), respectively. These three new 6TP analogs represent the first steps in the redesign of this potent anticancer agent into a better drug that possesses reduced toxic side effects while retaining therapeutic potency.","['Torres Hernandez, Arnaldo X', 'Weeramange, Chamitha J', 'Desman, Prathibha', 'Fatino, Anthony', 'Haney, Olivia', 'Rafferty, Ryan J']","['Torres Hernandez AX', 'Weeramange CJ', 'Desman P', 'Fatino A', 'Haney O', 'Rafferty RJ']","['Department of Chemistry , Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico , 2250 Boulevard Luis A.

TLRs may play a role in tumor development and growth because of expression or up-regulation of functional TLRs in some tumors and tumor cell lines. The participation of TLRs in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unspecified. This study aimed to investigate the effect of TLR2 and TLR4 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of AML patients in response to induction chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: Eighty- five patients with newly diagnosed AML were evaluated. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, the mRNA expression of genes TLR2 and TLR4 was measured before starting and after induction chemotherapy. The differences in the mean expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 before and after chemotherapy were compared using a paired t-test. The mean expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 regarding laboratory data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Chi-square test. Results: We found that the mRNA expression of TLR2 after induction chemotherapy was significantly lower as compared to before treatment (p=0.001). Also, we found a lower TLR4 gene expression level after chemotherapy as compared to before chemotherapy, albeit it was not statistically significant (p=0.21). Moreover, we observed significantly higher expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in AML-M3 cases compared to non-M3 AML patients. Conclusion: The decreased expression of TLR4 in leukemic samples after induction chemotherapy might indicate a novel potential prognostic role for this receptor, particularly in AML-M3 cases.","['Ramzi, Mani', 'Khalafi-Nezhad, Abolfazl', 'Iravani Saadi, Mahdiyar', 'Jowkar, Zahra']","['Ramzi M', 'Khalafi-Nezhad A', 'Iravani Saadi M', 'Jowkar Z']","['Hematology Research Center, Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Operative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,PMC6375370,,2019/02/19 06:00,2019/02/19 06:01,['2019/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/19 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2018 Oct 1;12(4):303-312.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Toll-like receptors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: The results represented the CD123 IHC expression in 55.3% and FLT3 gene mutations in 28.9% of cases. We found that 81.3% of patients who had FLT3/ITD gene mutations revealed IHC of CD123 expression (P=0.019). The CD123 expression against FLT3 was also correlated with monocytic differentiation in bone marrow blasts (P=0.031). There were significant correlations between IHC expression of CD123 and FLT3/ITD mutations with a high percentage of aspirated bone marrow blasts (P=0.01 and P=0.006, respectively) as well as the lack of CD34 expression in bone marrow blasts (P=0.007 and P=0.021, respectively). Conclusion: The CD123 IHC positive AMLs were correlated with certain pathologic features, some of which can be similar with correlations of background mutation of FLT3/ITD; According to the negative predictive value (NPV), 88.2% of CD123 IHC showed FLT3 gene mutation.

Methods: Total of 105 negative JAK2 cases including 5 Myeloproliferative Disorders (MPD), 15 Polycytemia Vera (PV) and 15 Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) who referred to Qaem Medical Center were assigned to this study. ARMS-PCR was carried out for measuring MPL mutations. Results: A significant difference was observed between MPL mutant and non-mutant groups from overview of MPL mutation (P=0.00001). From the total studied population, 14.28% were ET cases and 4.71% of them had splenomegaly.

In this research, 4.76 % of studied individuals had MPL (W515L/K) mutation, which were diagnosed with ET. Conclusion: Generally, the presence of JAK2 and MPL mutations are the most important criteria for MPN diagnosis. The obtained frequency of MPL mutation was similar to previous studies. Despite the high frequency of JAK2 and Philadelphia abnormality, MPL mutation was rare in myeloprolifrative disorders.

However, the introduction of gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN, have now opened the road for other organisms featuring large externally developing embryos that are easily accessible. Thanks to its unique diploid genome that shows a high degree of synteny to the human, combined with its relatively short live cycle, Xenopus tropicalis has now emerged as an additional powerful aquatic model for studying human disease genes. Genome editing techniques are very simple and extremely efficient, permitting the fast and cheap generation of genetic models for human disease. Mosaic disruption of tumor suppressor genes allows the generation of highly penetrant and low latency cancer models. While models for solid human tumors have been recently generated, genetic models for hematologic malignancies are currently lacking for Xenopus. Here we describe our experimental pipeline, based on mosaic genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9, to generate innovative and high-performing leukemia models in X. tropicalis. These add to the existing models in zebrafish and will extend the experimental platform available in aquatic vertebrate organisms to contribute to the field of hematologic malignancies. This will extend our knowledge in the etiology of this cancer and assist the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Dimitrakopoulou, Dionysia', 'Tulkens, Dieter', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Vleminckx, Kris']","['Dimitrakopoulou D', 'Tulkens D', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Vleminckx K']","['Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190201,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,PMC6367902,,2019/02/19 06:00,2019/02/19 06:01,['2019/02/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2019.00048 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2019 Feb 1;10:48. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2019.00048. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR/Cas9', '*T-ALL', '*Xenopus', '*cancer', '*genome editing', '*leukemia', '*thymus', '*tumor suppressor genes']",['R24 AI059830/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Front Physiol. 2019 Mar 14;10:210.

This study aimed to investigate whether ROS contributes to cytotoxicity in AML cells when treated with homoharringtonine (HHT) and etoposide (ETP) in combination. Methods: AML cell lines THP1 and HL60 and primary AML cells from patients were treated with HHT and ETP alone or in combination, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion test, and apoptosis was analyzed by annexin-V/propidium iodide double staining as well as Western blot for measuring expression of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3. Intracellular ROS level was detected by DCFH-DA fluorescence assay, and N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was used to scavenge intracellular ROS. Retroviral infection was applied to mediate stable overexpression in AML cells. Results: We show that HHT and ETP exhibit synergistic cytotoxicity in AML cell lines and primary AML cells in vitro, and meanwhile, HHT causes elevated ROS generation in ETP-treated AML cells. We next reveal that the elevated ROS is a critical factor for the synergistic cytotoxicity, since ROS scavenge by NAC remarkably diminishes this effect. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HHT causes elevated ROS generation by disabling thioredoxin-mediated antioxidant defense. Finally, similar to HHT treatment, depletion of thioredoxin sensitizes AML to ETP treatment. Conclusion: These results provide the foundation for augmenting the efficacy of ETP in treating AML with HHT, and also highlight the importance of targeting ROS in improving treatment outcome in AML.","['Zhang, Jingjing', 'Geng, Huayun', 'Liu, Ling', 'Zhang, Hao']","['Zhang J', 'Geng H', 'Liu L', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272029, Shandong Province, China, zhanghhjmu@163.com.', ""Department of Hematology, Dongchangfu People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Liaocheng 252000, Shandong Province, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272029, Shandong Province, China, zhanghhjmu@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272029, Shandong Province, China, zhanghhjmu@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190122,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC6349074,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2019/02/19 06:00,2019/02/19 06:01,['2019/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S187597 [doi]', 'cmar-11-1023 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Jan 22;11:1023-1032. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S187597. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'antioxidant defense', 'etoposide', 'homoharringtonine', 'reactive oxygen species', 'synergistic cytotoxicity', 'thioredoxin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no specific study has explored the expression pattern and role of miR-628 in AML. Materials and methods: In this study, RT-qPCR was performed to detect miR-628 expression in AML tissues and cell lines. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis and xenograft tumor experiment was carried out to determine the functions of miR-628 in AML cells. The possible mechanism underlying the activity of miR-628 in AML cells was also explored using a series of experiments. Results: Our results revealed the downregulated expression of miR-628 in patients with AML and AML cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-628 resulted in the inhibition of AML cell proliferation and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and attenuation of tumor growth in vivo. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-628 in AML cells. IGF-1R expression was upregulated in patients with AML and upregulation of IGF-1R expression inversely correlated with miR-628 level. Furthermore, IGF-1R knockdown imitated the tumor suppressive effect of miR-628 in AML cells. Restoration of IGF-1R expression abrogated the effects of miR-628 on the proliferation, cycle status, and apoptosis rate of AML cells. miR-628 inhibited the activation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in AML cells both in vitro and in vivo through the inhibition of IGF-1R expression. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that miR-628 exhibits antitumor effects in AML through the direct targeting of IGF-1R and regulation of PI3K/Akt pathway, suggestive of its potential role as a therapeutic target in patients with this aggressive hematological malignant tumor.","['Chen, Lu', 'Jiang, Xin', 'Chen, Haoyue', 'Han, Qiaoyan', 'Liu, Chunhua', 'Sun, Miao']","['Chen L', 'Jiang X', 'Chen H', 'Han Q', 'Liu C', 'Sun M']","[""Department of Hematology, Jingjiang People's Hospital, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Jiangsu 214500, P.R.

The goal of our study was to determine the incidence, obstetrical, and newborn outcomes of ALs in pregnancy.Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study on all births reported in the Health-Care Cost and Utilization Project-Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1999 and 2014. We calculated the incidence of ALs in pregnancy and conducted multivariate logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios for various maternal and newborn outcomes among this population compared to a nonaffected one.Results: We identified 291 maternal cases of ALs among 14,513,587 births, yielding an incidence of 2.01 per 100,000 births over the 15-year study period. There were approximately twice as many diagnoses of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as compared to acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). After adjusting for differing baseline characteristics and maternal and fetal deaths, we found that pregnant women with ALs were more likely to experience post-partum hemorrhage, to suffer from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), to require transfusions, to have wound complications, and to experience venous thromboembolism (VTEs). Maternal death, preterm delivery, and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) were more common in pregnant women with ALs.Conclusion: The incidence of ALs in pregnancy appears to be greater than what was previously believed. As it is associated with several adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, affected patients should be cared for in tertiary care institutions with access to high-risk obstetrical specialists, hematologists, and neonatologists.","['Nolan, Sabrina', 'Czuzoj-Shulman, Nicholas', 'Abenhaim, Haim Arie']","['Nolan S', 'Czuzoj-Shulman N', 'Abenhaim HA']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Community Studies, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Community Studies, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190217,England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,,,2019/02/19 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2019/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14767058.2019.1579188 [doi]'],ppublish,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2020 Oct;33(20):3514-3520. doi: 10.1080/14767058.2019.1579188.

One aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of sufentanil and ropivacaine on umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs). A second aim of this study was to determine whether sufentanil attenuated the cytotoxicity of ropivacaine in vitro. UCMSCs were divided into 3 groups: one was treated with ropivacaine at a concentration of 50, 100, 200, or 400 mug/mL, another was treated with sufentanil at a concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 nmol/L, and a third was treated with a combination of ropivacaine at a concentration of 200 mug/mL and sufentanil at a concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 nmol/L. Results indicated that cell proliferation decreased in cells treated with ropivacaine while it increased in cells treated with sufentanil. In addition, sufentanil limited the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on UCMSC growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Combined treatment with ropivacaine at a concentration of 200 mug/mL and sufentanil at a concentration of 500 nmol/L decreased the proportion of dead and apoptotic UCMSCs, and fewer cells were arrested in the S phase compared to cells treated with ropivacaine. Sufentanil inhibited the apoptosis induced by ropivacaine by increasing miR-182-5p, which regulated the expression of mRNA of the pro-apoptotic genes B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) and cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS). Sufentanil also increased the expression of mRNA of anti-apoptotic genes. In short, ropivacaine inhibits the cell viability and induces the apoptosis of UCMSCs in vitro while sufentanil attenuates this apoptosis by regulating miR182-5p/BCL10/CYCS.","['Li, Lisha', 'Sun, Yan', 'Zhang, Na', 'Qiu, Xuemin', 'Wang, Ling', 'Luo, Qingyan']","['Li L', 'Sun Y', 'Zhang N', 'Qiu X', 'Wang L', 'Luo Q']","['Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine-related Diseases.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine-related Diseases.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine-related Diseases.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine-related Diseases.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University.', 'The Academy of Integrative Medicine of Fudan University.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Endocrine-related Diseases.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190217,Japan,Biosci Trends,Bioscience trends,101502754,,,2019/02/19 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2019/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5582/bst.2018.01291 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Trends. 2019 Mar 14;13(1):49-57. doi: 10.5582/bst.2018.01291.

We used loss-of-function CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening to identify metabolic genes capable of influencing cellular commitment to apoptosis, using sensitization to the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 in BCL-2-dependent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines as a proxy for apoptotic disposition. This analysis revealed metabolic pathways that specifically cooperate with BCL-2 to sustain survival. In particular, our analysis singled out heme biosynthesis as an unappreciated apoptosis-modifying pathway. Although heme is broadly incorporated into the proteome, reduction of heme biosynthesis potentiates apoptosis through the loss of ETC activity, resulting in baseline depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and an increased propensity to undergo apoptosis.

TERM statistics can be used to predict peptide binding energies for Bcl-2 family proteins as accurately as widely used structure-based tools. Furthermore, design using TERM energies (dTERMen) rapidly and reliably generates high-affinity peptide binders of anti-apoptotic proteins Bfl-1 and Mcl-1 with just 15%-38% sequence identity to any known native Bcl-2 family protein ligand. High-resolution structures of four designed peptides bound to their targets provide opportunities to analyze the strengths and limitations of the computational design method.

METHODS: retrospective study of all patients diagnosed with invasive fungal sinusitis operated in the National Paediatric Oncology Unit between 2012 and 2016. Data taken from their medical history included: epidemiological characteristics, oncological diagnosis, haematological data, symptoms, tomographic studies, surgical interventions, results of pathology and cultures, medications received, complications, evolution and survival. RESULTS: 18 patients were identified, 7 male and 11 female. The average age was 12 years, 13 had a diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia and 5 of acute myeloid leukemia. Seventeen patients presented severe neutropenia at the time of diagnosis. The most frequently identified aetiological agent was Aspergillus in 13 patients. In 16 patients (89%) the disease was controlled with nasal endoscopic surgery. Ten patients died due to unrelated causes throughout the study. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fungal sinusitis should be considered a medical emergency due to its high mortality. The diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion in patients with predisposing factors (leukaemia, neutropenia, persistent fever, nasogastric tube) and endoscopic nasal evaluation. Antifungal medical treatment and aggressive nasal endoscopic surgery is indicated regardless of the patient's condition to reduce the fungal burden and associated high mortality. The treatment must be provided by a multidisciplinary team that includes paediatrics, haemato-oncology, infectology and otorhinolaryngology.","['Ramirez Argueta, Jorge Javier', 'Diaz Molina, Juan Pablo', 'Ortiz Oliva, Ricardo Jose', 'Carlos Bregni, Roman', 'Bustamante, Yomara']","['Ramirez Argueta JJ', 'Diaz Molina JP', 'Ortiz Oliva RJ', 'Carlos Bregni R', 'Bustamante Y']","['Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Centro Clinico de Cabeza y Cuello, Ciudad de Guatemala, Guatemala.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Centro Clinico de Cabeza y Cuello, Ciudad de Guatemala, Guatemala; Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Padiatrica (UNOP), Ciudad de Guatemala, Guatemala.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with a pathologically confirmed stage III non-anaplastic WT at nephrectomy (Group A) or with an 'inoperable' tumour at diagnosis managed by biopsy and pre-operative chemotherapy (Actinomycin D-Vincristine-Doxorubicin) but stage I or II at subsequent nephrectomy (Group B) were included. RESULTS: The 4-year overall (OS)/event free survival (EFS) for Group A (n=117) patients was 90%(95%CI:83-94)/81%(CI:73-87) and for Group B (n=32) 94%(CI:77-98)/88%(CI:70-95). The 4-year OS/EFS of patients with pathological stage III WT according to whether they received flank/abdominal radiotherapy (95 patients) or not (37 patients, 22 from UKW3 pooled with 17 patients from UKW2) were 91%(CI:83-95)/82%(CI:73-89), and 84%(CI:67-92)/78%(CI:61-89), respectively. The 4-year OS/EFS for patients having one reason to be stage III versus two or three was 92%(CI:84-96)/83%(CI:73-90) and 85%(CI:70-93)/78%(CI:61-88), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings question the inclusion of biopsy or pre-operative chemotherapy as sole criterion for assigning a tumour stage III. Selected patients with pathological stage III WT can survive without radiotherapy. Whilst cautious interpretation is needed due to the post hoc nature of these analyses, further biological studies may better characterise those who could benefit from reduced therapy.","['Irtan, Sabine', 'Messahel, Boo', 'Moroz, Veronica', 'Taylor, Roger E', 'Grundy, Richard', 'Kelsey, Anna', 'Vujanic, Gordan', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathy']","['Irtan S', 'Messahel B', 'Moroz V', 'Taylor RE', 'Grundy R', 'Kelsey A', 'Vujanic G', 'Pritchard-Jones K']","['Cancer Section, Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, UK.', ""Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals, UK."", 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU), School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK.', 'Clinical Oncology, Swansea University, UK.', ""Paediatric Oncology, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK."", ""Department of Pathology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, UK."", 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, UK.', 'Cancer Section, Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, UK.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) was detected by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). Patients with MRD positivity during consolidation chemotherapy had inferior 3-year CIR (55% vs. 36.7%; p = .037) and RFS (45% vs. 63.3%; p = .037) than those with MRD negativity.

Aberrant expression and activation of protein kinases are known to be accompanied by many types of cancer, and more than 30 small-molecule kinase inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer chemotherapy. Biological and clinical applications of small-molecule kinase inhibitors require comprehensive characterizations about how these inhibitors modulate the protein expression and activities of kinases at the entire proteome scale. In this study, we developed a parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted proteomic method to monitor the alterations in protein expression of kinases in K-562 chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) cells elicited by treatment with imatinib, an ABL kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA for CML treatment. By employing isotope-coded ATP affinity probes together with liquid chromatography-multiple-reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) analysis, we also examined the modulation of the ATP-binding affinities of kinases induced by imatinib treatment. The results revealed profound increases in protein expression levels of a large number of kinases in K-562 cells upon treatment with imatinib, which is accompanied by substantial decreases in ATP-binding capacities of many kinases. Apart from ABL kinases, we identified a number of other kinases whose ATP-binding affinities are markedly diminished upon imatinib treatment, including CHK1, a checkpoint kinase involved in DNA damage response signaling. Together, our targeted quantitative proteomic methods enabled, for the first time, dual assessments of small-molecule kinase inhibitor-induced changes in protein expression and ATP-binding affinities of kinases in live cells.","['Miao, Weili', 'Guo, Lei', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Miao W', 'Guo L', 'Wang Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190220,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,PMC6484830,,2019/02/19 06:00,2020/08/20 06:00,['2019/02/19 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00289 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2019 Mar 5;91(5):3209-3214. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00289.

METHODS: Competing risk survival analyses were used to examine cancer mortality risk in a cohort of 36 441 males aged 35+ years employed in the British rubber industry in 1967, followed up to 2015 (94% mortality). Exposure measurements are based on a population-specific quantitative job-exposure matrix for rubber dust, rubber fumes and N-nitrosamines from the EU-EXASRUB project. RESULTS: Exposure (lifetime cumulative (LCE))-response associations were found for N-nitrosomorphiline and all cancers (subdistribution HR (SHR) 1.48, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.57) and cancers of the bladder, stomach, multiple myeloma, oesophagus, prostate and pancreas, as well as for N-nitrosodimethylamine and all cancers (SHR 2.08, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.21) and cancers of the bladder, stomach, leukaemia, multiple myeloma, prostate and liver. LCE to the N-nitrosamines sum were associated with increased risks from all cancers (SHR 1.89, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.01) and cancers of the lung, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and brain. LCE to rubber dust and fumes are associated with increased mortality from all cancers (rubber dust SHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.58 to 1.78; rubber fumes SHR 1.91, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.03) and cancers of the bladder, lung, stomach, leukaemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, oesophagus, prostate, pancreas and liver. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous studies, N-nitrosamines exposures are associated with mortality from cancers of the bladder, lung, stomach, leukaemia, multiple myeloma, oesophagus, prostate, pancreas and liver. The long follow-up with nearly complete mortality enabled estimations of lifetime cancer mortality risk from occupational exposures in the rubber industry.","['Hidajat, Mira', 'McElvenny, Damien Martin', 'Ritchie, Peter', 'Darnton, Andrew', 'Mueller, William', 'van Tongeren, Martie', 'Agius, Raymond M', 'Cherrie, John W', 'de Vocht, Frank']","['Hidajat M', 'McElvenny DM', 'Ritchie P', 'Darnton A', 'Mueller W', 'van Tongeren M', 'Agius RM', 'Cherrie JW', 'de Vocht F']","['Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Research Division, Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Research Division, Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Statistics and Epidemiology Unit, Health and Safety Executive, Bootle, UK.', 'Research Division, Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, Centre for Epidemiology, School of Health Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, Centre for Epidemiology, School of Health Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Research Division, Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Biophysics and Bioengineering, Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190216,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,PMC6581114,['Competing interests: None declared.'],2019/02/18 06:00,2020/01/03 06:00,['2019/02/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['oemed-2018-105181 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2018-105181 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2019 Apr;76(4):250-258. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2018-105181.

In the absence of BCR-ABL, the conventional diagnostic algorithm recommends JAK2 V617F mutation testing to support diagnosis of other MPN diseases such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. In certain cases of thrombocythemia, simultaneous upfront testing of both BCR-ABL and JAK2 may be desirable. We wanted to test the feasibility of multiplex detection of BCR-ABL transcript variants and JAK2 V617F mutation simultaneously using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based reverse dot-blot hybridization (RDB) method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Separate biotinylated RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify specific BCR-ABL transcripts and JAK2 V617F mutant alleles. Specific hybridization of RT-PCR products with arrays of membrane-bound probes followed by colorimetric development would allow simultaneous visualization of BCR-ABL and/or JAK2 mutant transcripts in a given specimen. To validate the RDB method, we used cDNA specimens previously referred to our laboratory for routine clinical testing of BCR-ABL and/or JAK2. RESULTS: The limit of detection or analytical sensitivity of the RDB method using cDNA specimens was 0.5% and 6.25% in detecting BCR-ABL and JAK2 mutant transcripts, respectively.

All of the synthesized compounds screened at 1.0muM in the NanoBRET assay system exhibited >70% inhibition of the binding of a competitive probe TAMRA-Ac-TZ14011 (10nM) to CXCR4 in the presence of zinc (II) ion. Furthermore, selected compounds 3, 8, 9, 19 and 21 with spatial distances between the next carbon to Dpa and the next carbon to cyclam within the range of 6.5-7.5A showed potent binding affinity selective for CXCR4 with IC50 values of 1.6, 7.9, 5.7, 3.5 and 4.5nM, respectively, with corresponding high anti-HIV activity with EC50s of 28, 13, 21, 28 and 61nM, respectively, in the presence of zinc (II) ion. Some compounds with remarkably more potent CXCR4-binding affinity than that of an initial lead were obtained. These compounds interact with different but overlapping amino acid residues of CXCR4.

In many cancers, the study of metabolic reprograming has uncovered novel targets that are already being exploited in the clinic. However, CLL metabolism is still poorly understood. The ability of CLL lymphocytes to adapt to diverse microenvironments is accompanied by modifications in cell metabolism, revealing the challenge of targeting the CLL lymphocytes present in all different compartments. Despite this, the study of CLL metabolism led to an ongoing clinical trial using glucose uptake and mitochondrial respiration inhibitors. In contrast, glutamine and fatty acid metabolism remain to be further exploited in CLL. Here, we summarize the present knowledge of CLL metabolism, as well as the metabolic influence of Myc, ATM and p53 on CLL lymphocytes.","['Galicia-Vazquez, Gabriela', 'Aloyz, Raquel']","['Galicia-Vazquez G', 'Aloyz R']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research and Segal Cancer Center, Jewish General Hospital, 3755 Cote Ste.

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that development of grade III-IV aGVHD, particularly with gut or liver involvement, significantly contributed to higher nonrelapse mortality (P < .001), but PES and grade II-IV aGVHD did not. In subgroup analyses of underlying disease type, the development of PES had a significant effect on decreased relapse (P=.032) and better disease-free survival (DFS) (P=.046) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

We assessed the feasibility of integrated PET/MRI with 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) to assess the pathophysiology of whole-body bone marrow for the diagnosis and monitoring of BMFS. Twenty-five consecutive patients with BMFS underwent a pre-treatment (18)F-FLT PET/MRI scan. They included 7 patients with aplastic anemia (AA), 16 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 2 with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), primary myelofibrosis (MF), and secondary [post-essential thrombocythemia (post-ET)] MF. Two of the seven AA patients underwent a post-treatment scan. Eight of the 16 MDS patients who exhibited decreased (18)F-FLT uptake in the pelvis were considered to have hypoplastic MDS (hypo-MDS). (18)F-FLT PET and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were visually and quantitatively evaluated. RESULTS: The (18)F-FLT uptake in the ilium was strongly correlated with bone marrow cellularity based on biopsy samples (rho = 0.85). AA patients exhibited heterogeneously decreased uptake of (18)F-FLT according to disease severity. Multiple (18)F-FLT foci were observed in the proximal extremities, and they were in the central skeleton in severe AA patients. Post-treatment (18)F-FLT PET scans of severe AA patients reflected the response of hematopoietic activity to treatment. MDS patients had marked (18)F-FLT uptake in the central skeleton and proximal extremities, whereas hypo-MDS patients had heterogeneously decreased uptake, similar to that of non-severe AA patients. (18)F-FLT PET and DWI were unable to predict the progression to leukemia for both MDS and hypo-MDS patients. A primary MF patient had slightly decreased (18)F-FLT uptake in the central skeleton, but marked expansion of bone marrow activity to the distal extremities and high uptake of tracer in the extremely enlarged spleen (extramedullary hematopoiesis). In contrast, a secondary (post-ET) MF patient demonstrated marked bone marrow uptake, reflecting the hypercellular marrow with fibrosis. DWI revealed diffusely high signal intensities in both the primary and secondary MF patients. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FLT PET can be used to noninvasively assess whole-body bone marrow proliferative activity and DWI may reflect the different aspects of bone marrow pathophysiology from (18)F-FLT PET. (18)F-FLT PET/MRI is useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of BMFS, except for the differentiation between non-severe AA and hypo-MDS, and the prediction of progression to leukemia.","['Tsujikawa, Tetsuya', 'Tasaki, Toshiki', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Mori, Tetsuya', 'Makino, Akira', 'Kiyono, Yasushi', 'Zanotti-Fregonara, Paolo', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Okazawa, Hidehiko']","['Tsujikawa T', 'Tasaki T', 'Hosono N', 'Mori T', 'Makino A', 'Kiyono Y', 'Zanotti-Fregonara P', 'Yamauchi T', 'Okazawa H']","['Biomedical Imaging Research Center, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan. awaji@u-fukui.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Biomedical Imaging Research Center, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Biomedical Imaging Research Center, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Biomedical Imaging Research Center, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, 6670 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Biomedical Imaging Research Center, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuoka-Shimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190215,Germany,EJNMMI Res,EJNMMI research,101560946,PMC6377687,,2019/02/17 06:00,2019/02/17 06:01,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13550-019-0490-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13550-019-0490-0 [pii]']",epublish,EJNMMI Res. 2019 Feb 15;9(1):16. doi: 10.1186/s13550-019-0490-0.,['NOTNLM'],"['18F-FLT', 'Bone marrow failure syndrome', 'DWI', 'PET/MRI']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although KSHV latency is detected in KS-related tumors, oncogenic pathways activated by KSHV latent infection are not fully understood. Here, we found that retrotransposition of long interspersed element-1 (L1), a retrotransposon in the human genome, was enhanced in PEL cells. Among the KSHV latent genes, viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (vFLIP) enhanced L1 retrotransposition in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an NF-kappaB target, regulated the vFLIP-mediated enhancement of L1 retrotransposition. Furthermore, ICAM-1 downregulated the expression of Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), an L1 restriction factor. Knockdown of ICAM-1 or overexpression of MOV10 relieved the vFLIP-mediated enhancement of L1 retrotransposition. Collectively, during KSHV latency, vFLIP upregulates ICAM-1 in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner, which, in turn, downregulates MOV10 expression and thereby enhances L1 retrotransposition. Because active L1 retrotransposition can lead to genomic instability, which is commonly found in KS and PEL, activation of L1 retrotransposition during KSHV latency may accelerate oncogenic processes through enhancing genomic instability. Our results suggest that L1 retrotransposition may be a novel target for impeding tumor development in KSHV-infected patients.","['Nakayama, Ryota', 'Ueno, Yumiko', 'Ueda, Keiji', 'Honda, Tomoyuki']","['Nakayama R', 'Ueno Y', 'Ueda K', 'Honda T']","['Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. thonda@virus.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190215,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,2019/02/17 06:00,2019/10/12 06:00,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0726-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0726-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 May;38(22):4340-4351. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0726-5.

It was reported that withdrawal of IL-3 from Bax(-/-)Bak1(-/-) cells caused decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, leading to reduced glucose uptake, so that arrested cells required Atg5-dependent autophagy for long-term survival. In other cell types, a decrease in Glut1 is mediated by the thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), which is induced in IL-3-dependent myeloid cells when growth factor is removed. We mutated Atg5 and Txnip by CRISPR/Cas9 and found that Atg5-dependent autophagy was not necessary for the long-term viability of cycling or arrested Bax(-/-)Bak1(-/-) cells, and that Txnip was not required for the decrease in Glut1 expression in response to IL-3 withdrawal. Surprisingly, Atg5-deficient Bax/Bak1 double mutant cells survived for several weeks in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), without high concentrations of added glucose or glutamine. When serum was withdrawn, the provision of an equivalent amount of glucose present in 10% FBS (~0.5 mM) was sufficient to support cell survival for more than a week, in the presence or absence of IL-3. Thus, Bax(-/-)Bak1(-/-) myeloid cells deprived of growth factor consume extracellular glucose to maintain long-term viability, without a requirement for Atg5-dependent autophagy.","['Dong, Li', 'Reljic, Boris', 'Cheung, Jen G', 'Ng, Elizabeth S', 'Lindqvist, Lisa M', 'Elefanty, Andrew G', 'Vaux, David L', 'Tran, Hoanh']","['Dong L', 'Reljic B', 'Cheung JG', 'Ng ES', 'Lindqvist LM', 'Elefanty AG', 'Vaux DL', 'Tran H']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', ""Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', ""Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. tran.h@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190215,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,PMC6748108,,2019/02/17 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-019-0275-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-019-0275-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2019 Oct;26(10):2074-2085. doi: 10.1038/s41418-019-0275-z.

In multiple myelomas (MMs), however, these pathway intrinsic mutations are rare despite the fact that most tumors display aberrant Wnt pathway activity. Recent studies indicate that this activation is caused by genetic and epigenetic lesions of Wnt regulatory components, sensitizing MM cells to autocrine Wnt ligands and paracrine Wnts emanating from the bone marrow niche. These include deletion of the tumor suppressor CYLD, promotor methylation of the Wnt antagonists WIF1, DKK1, DKK3, and sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP4, sFRP5, as well as overexpression of the co-transcriptional activator BCL9 and the R-spondin receptor LGR4. Furthermore, Wnt activity in MM is strongly promoted by interaction of both Wnts and R-spondins with syndecan-1 (CD138) on the MM cell-surface. Functionally, aberrant canonical Wnt signaling plays a dual role in the pathogenesis of MM: (I) it mediates proliferation, migration, and drug resistance of MM cells; (II) MM cells secrete Wnt antagonists that contribute to the development of osteolytic lesions by impairing osteoblast differentiation. As discussed in this review, these insights into the causes and consequences of aberrant Wnt signaling in MM will help to guide the development of targeting strategies. Importantly, since Wnt signaling in MM cells is largely ligand dependent, it can be targeted by drugs/antibodies that act upstream in the pathway, interfering with Wnt secretion, sequestering Wnts, or blocking Wnt (co)receptors.","['van Andel, Harmen', 'Kocemba, Kinga A', 'Spaargaren, Marcel', 'Pals, Steven T']","['van Andel H', 'Kocemba KA', 'Spaargaren M', 'Pals ST']","['Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.t.pals@amc.uva.nl.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.t.pals@amc.uva.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190215,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6756057,,2019/02/17 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0404-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0404-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 May;33(5):1063-1075. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0404-1.

LEF1-AS1 is a conserved transcript dysregulated in hematopoiesis. This study aimed to functionally characterize the role of this transcript in myeloid malignancy and explore a possible regulatory effect of LEF1-AS1 upon LEF1. We show that LEF1-AS1 is highly expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells but barely detectable in myeloid malignant cell lines. Additionally, bone marrow cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (n=12) and acute myeloid malignancy patients (n=28) expressed significantly reduced levels of LEF1-AS1 compared to healthy controls (n=15). Artificial LEF1-AS1 over-expression inhibited proliferation in HL60 and led to an upregulation of tumor suppressors p21 and p27, and reduced ERK1/2 activation. Unexpectedly, no underlying modulation of LEF1 was detected. Ectopic expression of LEF1-AS1 also inhibited proliferation in HELA, a cell line lacking endogenous expression of LEF1, supporting a LEF1-independent mechanism. Additionally, transient over-expression of LEF1-AS1 in AML patient cells also led to reduced proliferation and colony formation capacity. We used a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach.

Although ATO has been shown to cause significant improvement in patients, it is associated with serious side effects, which sometimes lead to the patient's death. In this review paper, we examine the reports of ATO-induced cardiotoxicity in APL patients and evaluate the strategies to reduce the incidence of such toxicity. METHODS: The key search terms were ""arsenic trioxide,"" ""acute promyelocytic leukemia,"" ""cardiotoxicity,"" ""molecular pathway,"" and ""biomarker."" RESULTS: Studies have indicated the involvement of several molecular pathways in ATO-induced cardiotoxicity. These pathways increase the production of reactive oxygen species by interfering with intracellular calcium homeostasis as well as impairing the transfer of calcium into endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. On the other hand, increasing or decreasing expressions of some microRNAs (miRs) have been shown to play a role in cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Finally, it can be stated that given the essential role of molecular pathways in cardiotoxicity and considering the fact these pathways impair the regulation of miRs expression, identification of molecular pathways involved in ATO-induced cardiotoxicity aimed at targeting miRs could be a new therapeutic strategy to prevent cardiotoxicity.","['Haybar, Habib', 'Shahrabi, Saeid', 'Rezaeeyan, Hadi', 'Jodat, Hosein', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Haybar H', 'Shahrabi S', 'Rezaeeyan H', 'Jodat H', 'Saki N']","['Atherosclerosis Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190215,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,,2019/02/17 06:00,2019/02/17 06:00,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.28292 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Feb 15. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28292.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'calcium', 'cardiotoxicity', 'microRNA']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8494-5594'],,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these compounds are effective in killing proliferating blasts, they lack activity against quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which contributes to initial treatment refractoriness or subsequent disease relapse. The reagent 8-chloro-adenosine (8-Cl-Ado) is a ribose-containing, RNA-directed nucleoside analog that is incorporated into newly transcribed RNA rather than in DNA, causing inhibition of RNA transcription. In this report, we demonstrate antileukemic activities of 8-Cl-Ado in vitro and in vivo and provide mechanistic insight into the mode of action of 8-Cl-Ado in AML. 8-Cl-Ado markedly induced apoptosis in LSC, with negligible effects on normal stem cells. 8-Cl-Ado was particularly effective against AML cell lines and primary AML blast cells harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation. FLT3-ITD is associated with high expression of miR-155. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 8-Cl-Ado inhibits miR-155 expression levels accompanied by induction of DNA-damage and suppression of cell proliferation, through regulation of miR-155/ErbB3 binding protein 1(Ebp1)/p53/PCNA signaling. Finally, we determined that combined treatment of NSG mice engrafted with FLT3-ITD (+) MV4-11 AML cells with 8-Cl-Ado and the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 (quizartinib) synergistically enhanced survival,

However, little is known about the risk of these women dying before they use the preserved material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2016, 927 girls and women underwent OTC in our center, before receiving gonadotoxic treatment. All patients were without disseminated disease and with an estimated chance of survival after 5 years of >50%. For each patient the specific indication for OTC was noted, and through a national registry linked to a personal identification number, we were able to identify those who had died and the date and cause of death. RESULTS: By December 2017, 124/927 patients had died from their disease (13%). The highest relative prevalence of death was seen in patients with liver cancer (2/2; 100%), gall bladder cancer (2/2; 100%), stomach cancer (1/1; 100%), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (2/3; 66%), scleroderma (1/2; 50%), and sarcoma (24/78; 31%). The lowest risk of dying was seen in the group of individuals with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3/30; 10%) and breast cancer (31/313; 10%). The shortest time from OTC to death was seen in those with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (mean interval 0.25 years), gall bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin disease and acute myeloid leukemia (mean interval 0.7 years) and the longest time from OTC to death was in women with breast cancer (mean interval 3.4 years). Of those who died, 34 had received chemotherapy at some point before OTC, indicating a relapse or non-responsiveness to the initial treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers and sarcoma had the highest risk of dying from their disease. Breast cancer patients had the lowest risk. This knowledge may guide clinicians in their decisions on whether to offer OTC to girls and younger women with a life-threatening disease.","['Macklon, Kirsten Tryde']",['Macklon KT'],"['The Fertility Clinic, section 4071, University Hospital of Copenhagen Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190329,United States,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,0370343,,,2019/02/17 06:00,2020/01/29 06:00,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/aogs.13576 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2019 May;98(5):625-629. doi: 10.1111/aogs.13576.

A Review of Variation in Risk by Subtype.,846-856,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0801 [doi],"Although substantial advances in the identification of cytogenomic subtypes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been made in recent decades, epidemiologic research characterizing the etiologic heterogeneity of ALL by subtype has not kept pace. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature concerning subtype-specific epidemiologic risk factor associations with ALL subtype defined by immunophenotype (e.g., B-cell vs. T-cell) and cytogenomics (including gross chromosomal events characterized by recurring numerical and structural abnormalities, along with cryptic balanced rearrangements, and focal gene deletions). In case-control analyses investigating nongenetic risk factors, home paint exposure is associated with hyperdiploid, MLL-rearranged, and ETV6-RUNX1 subtypes, yet there are few differences in risk factor associations between T- and B-ALL. Although the association between maternal smoking and ALL overall has been null, maternal smoking is associated with an increasing number of gene deletions among cases. GWAS-identified variants in ARID5B have been the most extensively studied and are strongly associated with hyperdiploid B-ALL. GATA3 single nucleotide variant rs3824662 shows a strong association with Ph-like ALL (OR = 3.14). However, there have been relatively few population-based studies of adequate sample size to uncover risk factors that may define etiologic heterogeneity between and within the currently defined cytogenomic ALL subtypes.","['Williams, Lindsay A', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Marcotte, Erin L', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Williams LA', 'Yang JJ', 'Hirsch BA', 'Marcotte EL', 'Spector LG']","['Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. spector@umn.edu.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20190215,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,PMC6500468,,2019/02/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:00,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-18-0801 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0801 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2019 May;28(5):846-856. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0801.

However, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine, restricts inflammation by blocking Th17-cell differentiation via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that microbiota dysregulation promotes LIF secretion by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in a mouse colitis model. LIF greatly activates STAT4 phosphorylation on multiple SPXX elements within the C-terminal transcription regulation domain. STAT4 and STAT3 act reciprocally on both canonical cis-inducible elements (SIEs) and noncanonical ""AGG"" elements at different loci. In lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs), STAT4 activation by LIF blocks STAT3-dependent Il17a/Il17f promoter activation, whereas in IECs, LIF bypasses the extraordinarily low level of STAT4 to induce YAP gene expression via STAT3 activation. In addition, we found that the administration of LIF is sufficient to restore microbiome homeostasis. Thus, LIF effectively inhibits Th17 accumulation and promotes repair of damaged intestinal epithelium in inflamed colon, serves as a potential therapy for IBD.","['Zhang, Yanan S', 'Xin, Dazhuan E', 'Wang, Zhizhang', 'Song, Xinyang', 'Sun, Yanyun', 'Zou, Quanli C', 'Yue, Jichen', 'Zhang, Chenxi', 'Zhang, Junxun M', 'Liu, Zhi', 'Zhang, Xiaoren', 'Zhao, Ting C', 'Su, Bing', 'Chin, Y Eugene']","['Zhang YS', 'Xin DE', 'Wang Z', 'Song X', 'Sun Y', 'Zou QC', 'Yue J', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang JM', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang X', 'Zhao TC', 'Su B', 'Chin YE']","['Institutes of Biology and Medical Sciences, Soochow University Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Institutes of Biology and Medical Sciences, Soochow University Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Roger Williams Medical Center, Boston University Medical School, Boston University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Shanghai Institute of Immunology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Institutes of Biology and Medical Sciences, Soochow University Medical College, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China chinyue@suda.edu.cn.', 'Institue of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190215,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,PMC6418461,,2019/02/17 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['embj.201899595 [pii]', '10.15252/embj.201899595 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2019 Mar 15;38(6). pii: embj.201899595. doi: 10.15252/embj.201899595.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis evaluated the ratio of clinical benefit-risk in patients treated with lenalidomide or placebo, and assessed the effect of lenalidomide dose reductions on response. Clinical benefit was a composite endpoint defined as RBC-TI, transfusion reduction >/= 4 units packed red blood cells, hemoglobin increase >/= 1.5 g/dL, or cytogenetic response. RESULTS: The rate of clinical benefit was higher with lenalidomide than with placebo (31.9% vs. 3.8%). The ratio of response (RBC-TI and clinical benefit) to risk (hematologic AEs) favored lenalidomide over placebo. Patients who underwent >/= 1 lenalidomide dose reduction had a longer duration of treatment, received a higher cumulative dose, and were more likely to experience clinical benefit versus patients without dose reductions. CONCLUSION: Despite the occurrence of hematologic AEs, the overall benefit-risk profile supported lenalidomide treatment. Appropriate management of hematologic AEs by dose reductions may help patients with myelodysplastic syndromes to remain on treatment and achieve clinical benefit.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Almeida, Antonio', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Weaver, Jerry', 'Santini, Valeria']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Almeida A', 'Fenaux P', 'Gattermann N', 'Giagounidis A', 'Goldberg SL', 'Ozawa K', 'Weaver J', 'Santini V']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding pioglitazone to standard induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, newly diagnosed AML patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. Patients in both groups received cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day for 7 days) and daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) per day for 3 days). Patients in the pioglitazone group additionally received oral pioglitazone (45 mg per day). The 2 groups were compared according to remission rate, laboratory findings, and adverse events during treatment. RESULTS: Forty patients were evaluated, 20 patients in each group. The complete remission rate was 20% more in the pioglitazone group compared to the control group (P = .202). Complications due to pioglitazone discontinuation were observed in 2 cases. The mean serum alanine aminotransferase in the fourth treatment week was significantly more in pioglitazone group compared to the control group (65.5 vs. 33.6 mg/dL, P = .039). The mean serum creatinine in all treatment phases was significantly higher in the pioglitazone group compared to the control group (P < .05). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding other laboratory findings (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Adding pioglitazone to cytarabine and daunorubicin increased the remission rate in AML patients compared to control subjects. Although this difference in remission rate between the 2 groups was not statistically significant, it could be important in the clinical setting.

However, current therapeutic results are still unsatisfactory in untreated high-risk patients and poorer in those with primary refractory or relapsed disease. In older patients, reluctance by clinicians to treat unfit patients, higher AML cell resistance related to more frequent adverse karyotype and/or precedent myelodysplastic syndrome, and preferential involvement of chemorefractory early hemopoietic precursors in the pathogenesis of the disease further account for poor prognosis, with median survival lower than six months. A general agreement exists concerning the administration of aggressive salvage therapy in young adults followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation; on the contrary, different therapeutic approaches varying in intensity, from conventional salvage chemotherapy based on intermediate(-)high-dose cytarabine to best supportive care, are currently considered in the relapsed, older AML patient population. Either patients' characteristics or physicians' attitudes count toward the process of clinical decision making. In addition, several new drugs with clinical activity described as ""promising"" in uncontrolled single-arm studies failed to improve long-term outcomes when tested in larger randomized clinical trials. Recently, new agents have been approved and are expected to consistently improve the clinical outcome for selected genomic subgroups, and research is in progress in other molecular settings. While relapsed AML remains a tremendous challenge to both patients and clinicians, knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease is fast in progress, potentially leading to personalized therapy in most patients.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Lessi, Federica', 'Vitagliano, Orsola', 'Birkenghi, Erika', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Ferrara F', 'Lessi F', 'Vitagliano O', 'Birkenghi E', 'Rossi G']","['Division of Hematology, Cardarelli Hospital, 80128 Napoli, Italy. felicettoferrara@katamail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35153 Padua, Italy. lessi.federica@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Cardarelli Hospital, 80128 Napoli, Italy. orsola.vitagliano@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Spedali Civili, 25123 Brescia, Italy. erika.borlenghi@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Spedali Civili, 25123 Brescia, Italy. giuseppe.rossi@asst-spedalicivili.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190214,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC6406399,,2019/02/17 06:00,2019/02/17 06:01,['2019/02/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/17 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11020224 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11020224 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Feb 14;11(2). pii: cancers11020224. doi: 10.3390/cancers11020224.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'new drugs', 'older patients', 'relapse']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) can be effective and is recommended as an upfront treatment in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. We studied the barriers to alloHSCT in one of the largest ATLL populations in the United States. Comprehensive chart and donor registry reviews were conducted for 88 ATLL patients treated at Montefiore Medical Center from 2003 to 2018. Among 49 patients with acute and 32 with lymphomatous subtypes, 48 (59.5%) were ineligible for alloHSCT because of early mortality (52%), loss to follow-up (21%), uninsured status (15%), patient declination (10%), and frailty (2%). Among 28 HLA-typed eligible patients (34.6%), matched related donors were identified for 7 (25%). A matched unrelated donor (MUD) search yielded HLA-matched in 2 patients (9.5%), HLA mismatched in 6 (28.5%), and no options in 13 (62%). Haploidentical donors were identified for 6 patients (46%) with no unrelated options. There were no suitable donors for 7 (25%) alloHSCT-eligible patients. The main limitation for alloHSCT after donor identification was death from progressive disease (82%). AlloHSCT was performed in 10 patients (12.3%) and was associated with better relapse-free survival (26 versus 11 months, P=.04) and overall survival (47 versus 10 months, P=.03). Early mortality and progressive disease are the main barriers to alloHSCT, but poor follow-up, uninsured status, and lack of suitable donor, including haploidentical, are also substantial limitations that might disproportionally affect this vulnerable population. AlloHSCT can achieve long-term remissions, and strategies aiming to overcome these barriers are urgently needed to improve outcomes in ATLL.","['Adrianzen Herrera, Diego', 'Kornblum, Noah', 'Acuna-Villaorduna, Ana', 'Sica, R Alejandro', 'Shah, Urvi', 'Butler, Moya', 'Vishnuvardhan, Nivetha', 'Shah, Nishi', 'Bachier-Rodriguez, Lizamarie', 'Derman, Olga', 'Shastri, Aditi', 'Mantzaris, Ioannis', 'Verma, Amit K', 'Braunschweig, Ira', 'Janakiram, Murali']","['Adrianzen Herrera D', 'Kornblum N', 'Acuna-Villaorduna A', 'Sica RA', 'Shah U', 'Butler M', 'Vishnuvardhan N', 'Shah N', 'Bachier-Rodriguez L', 'Derman O', 'Shastri A', 'Mantzaris I', 'Verma AK', 'Braunschweig I', 'Janakiram M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York; Department of Medicine, Division of HOT, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

We included all children aged < 15 years with newly diagnosed ALL in Canada between 2001 and 2018 using the Cancer in Young People in Canada national registry. We examined factors potentially associated with the likelihood of receiving HSCT using univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 3992 patients with newly diagnosed ALL were included. Three hundred twenty-five (8.1%) received an HSCT and formed the transplant cohort. In multivariable analysis factors independently associated with an increased odds of receiving HSCT were male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.93), initial WBC >/= 50,000x10(9)/L (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.28), mixed phenotype acute leukemia relative to B-precursor ALL (OR, 34.32; 95% CI, 16.64 to 70.79), T cell relative to B-precursor ALL (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.91), unfavorable relative to standard cytogenetics (OR, 3.96; 95% CI, 2.56 to 6.12), and relapse before HSCT (OR, 32.77; 95%, 23.89 to 44.96). No association was found between race, neighborhood income quintile or region at diagnosis, and receipt of HSCT. Diagnosis at an HSCT treating center (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.09) and residential distance from the ALL treating center (OR, 1.84 for >/=300 km compared with <100 km; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.91) were associated with higher odds of receiving HSCT. In a publically funded healthcare system, children with ALL had equitable access to HSCT, which was largely governed by biologic disease-related factors. Patients diagnosed at an HSCT performing center and patients who live farthest away from their treatment center had higher odds of receiving HSCT, although the effect was small, possibly suggesting preferential referral to HSCT for some patients.","['Truong, Tony H', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Cuvelier, Geoff D E', 'Paulson, Kristjan', 'Rayar, Meera', 'Mitchell, David', 'Schultz, Kirk R', ""O'Shea, Debbie"", 'Barber, Randy', 'Wall, Donna', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Truong TH', 'Pole JD', 'Bittencourt H', 'Schechter T', 'Cuvelier GDE', 'Paulson K', 'Rayar M', 'Mitchell D', 'Schultz KR', ""O'Shea D"", 'Barber R', 'Wall D', 'Sung L']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplant, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

This study addresses the risk of hyperthyroidism in relation to incidental therapeutic radiation dose to the thyroid and pituitary glands in a large cohort of survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study's cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed at hospitals in the United States and Canada between 1970 and 1986, the occurrence of hyperthyroidism through 2009 was ascertained among 12,183 survivors who responded to serial questionnaires. Radiation doses to the thyroid and pituitary glands were estimated from radiation therapy records, and chemotherapy exposures were abstracted from medical records. Binary outcome regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) for hyperthyroidism at 5 years from diagnosis of childhood cancer and Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (RRs) after the first 5 years. RESULTS: Survivors reported 179 cases of hyperthyroidism, of which 148 were diagnosed 5 or more years after their cancer diagnosis. The cumulative proportion of survivors diagnosed with hyperthyroidism by 30 years after the cancer diagnosis was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0%-2.9%) among those who received radiation therapy. A linear relation adequately described the thyroid radiation dose response for prevalence of self-reported hyperthyroidism 5 years after cancer diagnosis (excess OR/Gy, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06-0.95) and incidence rate thereafter (excess RR/Gy, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03-0.14) over the dose range of 0 to 63 Gy. Neither radiation dose to the pituitary gland nor chemotherapy was associated significantly with hyperthyroidism. Radiation-associated risk remained elevated >25 years after exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of hyperthyroidism after radiation therapy during childhood is positively associated with external radiation dose to the thyroid gland, with radiation-related excess risk persisting for >25 years. Neither radiation dose to the pituitary gland nor chemotherapy exposures were associated with hyperthyroidism among childhood cancer survivors through early adulthood.","['Inskip, Peter D', 'Veiga, Lene H S', 'Brenner, Alina V', 'Sigurdson, Alice J', 'Ostroumova, Evgenia', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Smith, Susan A', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Lubin, Jay H']","['Inskip PD', 'Veiga LHS', 'Brenner AV', 'Sigurdson AJ', 'Ostroumova E', 'Chow EJ', 'Stovall M', 'Smith SA', 'Leisenring W', 'Robison LL', 'Armstrong GT', 'Sklar CA', 'Lubin JH']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland; Retired.

On the other hand, malnutrition, presented by oncological patients, is caused by both the disease and its treatment. Some serum biochemical parameters cannot be determined by the traditional method of laboratory blood analysis (spectrophotometry). Among the various techniques that could be used for blood biochemical analysis, we opted for the Z-scan technique, due to its sensitivity to the reading of blood components. Our objective in this work was to compare the data obtained by the Z-scan technique and the spectrophotometry of the serological samples of children with solid tumors and leukemia under treatment, receiving or not selenium supplementation in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The biochemical parameters were read based on blood. These blood sampling made at different stages of chemotherapy and selenium supplementation. At each of these stages, the cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides parameters were read using the Z-scan and spectrophotometry techniques. We observed that selenium helps in balancing the health of these patients, and corroborates with our hypothesis that the Z-scan technique may be an alternative for the determination of biochemical parameters.","['Alves, S', 'Sonego, D R N', 'Fudimura, K A', 'Hallack, M L', 'Azzalis, L A', 'Junqueira, V B C', 'Rocha, K C', 'Fonseca, R L A', 'Figueiredo, F W S', 'Fonseca, F L A']","['Alves S', 'Sonego DRN', 'Fudimura KA', 'Hallack ML', 'Azzalis LA', 'Junqueira VBC', 'Rocha KC', 'Fonseca RLA', 'Figueiredo FWS', 'Fonseca FLA']","['Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Instituto de Ciencias Ambientais, Quimicas e Farmaceuticas, Rua Prof. Arthur Riedel, 275, Jardim Eldorado, 09972-270 Diadema, SP, Brazil.

We conducted a multi-centre retrospective analysis of 105 R/R CLL patients who received venetoclax pre-National Health Service commissioning. The median age was 67 years and median prior lines was 3 (range: 1-15). 48% had TP53 disruption. At >/=2 lines, 60% received a Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor (BTKi) and no prior phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (Pi3Ki), 25% received a Pi3Ki and no prior BTKi, and 10% received both. Patients discontinued B cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) because of toxicity in 44% and progression in 54%. Tumour lysis syndrome risk was low, intermediate or high in 27%, 25%, and 48% respectively. Overall response was 88% (30% complete response [CR]). The overall response rate was 85% (CR 23%) in BTKi-exposed patients, 92% (CR 38%) in Pi3Ki-exposed patients and 80% (CR 20%) in both (P = 0.59). With a median follow-up of 15.6 months, 1-year progression-free survival was 65.0% and 1-year overall survival was 75.1%. Dose reduction or temporary interruption did not result in an inferior progression-free or discontinuation-free survival. Risk of progression or death after stopping a prior BCRi for progression was double compared to those stopping for other reasons (predominantly toxicity) (Hazard Ratio 2.01 P = 0.05).

30768627,NLM,MEDLINE,20200309,1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),14,2,2019,The rs61742690 (S783N) single nucleotide polymorphism is a suitable target for disrupting BCL11A-mediated foetal-to-adult globin switching.,e0212492,10.1371/journal.pone.0212492 [doi],"BACKGROUND: B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A) is a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor protein that is a critical modulator of haemoglobin switching and suppresses the production of foetal haemoglobin. Variation in the BCL11A gene ameliorates the severity of sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia (beta-thal). The BCL11A gene is located on chromosome 2p16.1 and encodes an 835-amino acid protein. METHOD: Using state-of-the-art in silico tools, this study examined the most pathogenic non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) that disrupt the BCL11A protein and mediate foetal-to-adult globin switching. A total of 11,463 SNPs were retrieved from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP). These included 799 in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), 486 in the 3' UTR, and 266 non-synonymous, 189 coding synonymous, six nonsense, and six stop-gained SNPs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In silico tools (SIFT, SNAP, PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, I-Mutant, PROVEAN, SNPs&GO, mCSM, and PhD-SNP) predicted the five most-deleterious nsSNPs: rs61742690, rs62142605, rs17028351, rs115666026, and rs74987258. Molecular dynamic simulation and homology modelling of the mutated proteins (S783N, D643N, G451S, K670R, and M313L) of the most deleterious nsSNPs revealed their functional and structural impact. nsSNP rs61742690 was predicted to be the most deleterious, as supported by eight of the nine in silico tools. CONCLUSIONS: Complete failure in the protein-protein interactions with functional partners (KLF1 and others) and significant changes (+/-100% variation) in the interface energy revealed that rs61742690 (S783N) in the zinc-finger domain is a suitable target for disrupting BCL11A-mediated foetal-to-adult globin switching.","['Abdulazeez, Sayed', 'Sultana, Shaheen', 'Almandil, Noor B', 'Almohazey, Dana', 'Bency, B Jesvin', 'Borgio, J Francis']","['Abdulazeez S', 'Sultana S', 'Almandil NB', 'Almohazey D', 'Bency BJ', 'Borgio JF']","['Department of Genetic Research, Institute for Research and Medical Consultation (IRMC), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.', 'Interserve Learning and Employment, As Sawari, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy Research, Institute for Research and Medical Consultation (IRMC), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Stem Cell Research, Institute for Research and Medical Consultation (IRMC), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Malankara Catholic College, Mariagiri, Kanyakumari District, Kaliakkavilai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Genetic Research, Institute for Research and Medical Consultation (IRMC), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190215,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6377191,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/02/16 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2018/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0212492 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-07257 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Feb 15;14(2):e0212492. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0212492. eCollection 2019.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9763-9446', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6820-2501', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0963-5136', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7199-1540']",,,20191118,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Globins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']","['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are an effective carrier for therapeutic peptides that improve their stability in vivo, while also enabling nonspecific adsorption of complementary proteins to enhance their effectiveness. Using p53 peptide as a model known to disrupt the intracellular MDM2-p53 protein-protein interaction which tags the endogenous p53 proteins for degradation, we conjugated p53 peptides to AuNPs (AuNP-p53) and examined the functionality of AuNP-p53 to release the endogenous p53 proteins from being tagged for degradation, thereby increasing the level of stable p53 proteins in acute myeloid leukemia 2 (AML2) cells. We found that AuNPs did not just protect conjugated p53 peptides from trypsin degradation, but also helped to recruit 56.5% and 26.4% of total MDM2 and p53 proteins in the cells to form a protein corona around AuNP-p53. The proximity of MDM2/p53 complexes and p53 peptide on the surface of AuNP-p53 facilitated the action of p53 peptides to cause a sustained elevation of the p53 level in AML2 cells up to 6 h, which was not possible with free p53 peptide alone at the same concentration. Even a 20-fold higher concentration of free p53 peptide caused only a short-lived elevated p53 level of 1 h. The outcome of this study highlights the utility of combining conjugated ligands and complementary protein adsorption on nanoparticles to improve the biological functionality of the therapeutic ligands.","['Chan, Kian Ping', 'Chao, Sheng-Hao', 'Kah, James Chen Yong']","['Chan KP', 'Chao SH', 'Kah JCY']","['NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering , National University of Singapore , University Hall, Tan Chin Tuan Wing, Level 04, #04-02, 21 Lower Kent Ridge , Singapore 119077.', 'Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research , Singapore , 20 Biopolis Way, #06-01 Centros , Singapore 138668.', 'Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research , Singapore , 20 Biopolis Way, #06-01 Centros , Singapore 138668.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology , National University of Singapore , 5 Science Drive 2, Blk MD4, Level 3 , Singapore 117597.', 'NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering , National University of Singapore , University Hall, Tan Chin Tuan Wing, Level 04, #04-02, 21 Lower Kent Ridge , Singapore 119077.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering , National University of Singapore , 4 Engineering Drive 3, Blk E4, #04-08 , Singapore 117583.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190228,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,,,2019/02/16 06:00,2020/01/01 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00032 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2019 Mar 20;30(3):920-930. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00032.

The ALV-J strain NX0101, which was isolated from broiler breeders in 2001, mainly induces the formation of myeloid cell tumors. However, strain HN10PY01, which was recently isolated from laying hens, mainly induces the formation of myeloid cell tumors and hemangioma. In order to determine the difference in pathogenicity of the 2 strains in broiler chickens, 2 groups of chicken embryos were infected with NA0101 and HN10PY01 separately. A comparison was made of the mortality, oncogenicity, body weights, indexes for immune organs, levels of ALV group-specific antigen p27, and mRNA expression levels of the tumor-related gene, p53, in ALV-J-infected birds and immune organs of theses chickens in response to Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and avian influenza virus subtype H9 (AIV-H9) vaccination. The results indicated that strain NX0101 was highly pathogenic in broiler chickens and led to a 30% mortality rate and 45% oncogenicity, compared with the HN10PY01-infected birds. Weight of chickens was also significantly lower after 15 wk (P < 0.05). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of tumor-related p53 in medulla, liver, and lung in broilers infected with strain NX0101 were significantly higher than those infected with strain HN10PY01 (P < 0.05). These results indicated that strain NX0101 had a higher replication ability in broiler chickens.

X-ray diffraction confirmed the tendency to establish aurophillic interations for those complexes containing dppe. Luminescence studies and theoretical calculations revealed a different origin for both families, i.e. indole and isatin species. Thus, indole derivatives presented a ligand-to-ligand-charge-transfer transition (LLCT) from the indole to the PPh3 fragment, whereas for the isatin derivatives an intraligand-charge-transfer transition (ILCT) within the isatin fragment is proposed. In both cases, the gold centre was slightly implicated as a ligand-to-metal-charge transfer transition (LMCT) (from the indole/isatin to Au(i)). Cell antiproliferative assays in lung cancer cells (A549), leukemia Jurkat-pLVTHM and Jurkat-shBak cells (cisplatin sensitive and resistant, respectively) showed excellent cytotoxic values (10.11-0.28 muM), showing the leukemia cells to be the most sensitive and the bimetallic species to be the most active agents. Preliminary studies associated the cytotoxicity with a combination of different factors, the metallic fragment being mainly responsible. Remarkably, these complexes are able to inhibit the cellular growth of cisplatin resistant Jurkat-shBak cells highlighting their promising future as an alternative anticancer agent.","['Fernandez-Moreira, Vanesa', 'Val-Campillo, Cynthia', 'Ospino, Isaura', 'Herrera, Raquel P', 'Marzo, Isabel', 'Laguna, Antonio', 'Gimeno, M Concepcion']","['Fernandez-Moreira V', 'Val-Campillo C', 'Ospino I', 'Herrera RP', 'Marzo I', 'Laguna A', 'Gimeno MC']","['Departamento de Quimica Inorganica, Instituto de Sintesis Quimica y Catalisis Homogenea (ISQCH), CSIC-Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain. vanesa@unizar.es gimeno@unizar.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Dalton Trans,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",101176026,,,2019/02/16 06:00,2019/02/16 06:01,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/16 06:01 [medline]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8dt00298c [doi]'],ppublish,Dalton Trans. 2019 Feb 26;48(9):3098-3108. doi: 10.1039/c8dt00298c.,,,,,,,,20190304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: 327 children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia from four pediatric oncology programs across the United States. METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: Participants completed fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, nausea, and depression symptom questionnaires at four time points; these symptoms comprised the CCSC-L. HRQOL was measured at the start of postinduction therapy and then at the start of maintenance therapy. Relationships between the CCSC-L and HRQOL scores were examined with longitudinal parallel-process modeling. RESULTS: The mean HRQOL significantly increased over time (p < 0.001). The CCSC-L had a significant negative association with HRQOL scores at the start of postinduction therapy (beta = -0.53, p < 0.005) and the start of maintenance therapy (beta = -0.33, p < 0.015). Participants with more severe symptoms in the CCSC-L over time had significantly lower HRQOL at the start of maintenance therapy (beta = -0.42, p < 0.005).

On the contrary, the risk for early death (ED) in APL patients treated with ATO continues to have a negative impact for optimization of APL therapeutics. There is an urgent need for precision medicine and biomarkers in clinical monitoring of ATO toxicity in APL, and ED in particular. This retrospective case series cohort proteomics study was conducted as a hypothesis generation effort and provides here several potential molecular leads on serum peptides expressed at different times after treatment with ATO in patients with APL. In 12 patients with a de novo APL diagnosis, and treated with single-agent ATO as frontline remission induction therapy, serum peptides were fractionated by weak cation exchange magnetic beads and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Ten peptides (m/z 2075.5, 2084.2, 2203.0, 2265.2, 2872.8, 2916.6, 3145.2, 3153.4, 3953.4, and 3964.8) were significantly downregulated in serum after ATO treatment. Among them, four peptides were identified as (1) Immunoglobulin heavy chain V-III region BUT, (2) RRP15-like protein, (3) filaggrin, and (4) protein SON isoform F. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical oncology proteomic biomarker study with a view to future rational therapeutic monitoring of patients with APL in the course of single-agent ATO treatment and hematological CR.","['Cao, Fenglin', 'Li, Xingang', 'Yang, Yiju', 'Fang, Honghong', 'Qu, Haixia', 'Chang, Naibai', 'Ma, Qingwei', 'Cao, Weifan', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Wang, Wei']","['Cao F', 'Li X', 'Yang Y', 'Fang H', 'Qu H', 'Chang N', 'Ma Q', 'Cao W', 'Zhou J', 'Wang W']","['1 Department of Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', '2 School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.', ""3 The Third People's Hospital of Hainan Province, Sanya, China."", '4 Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', '5 Bioyong (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China.', '6 Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, China.', '5 Bioyong (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China.', '7 College of Life Science, Northeast Forest University, Harbin, China.', '8 Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', '2 School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.', '4 Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', '9 School of Public Health, Taishan Medical University, Taishan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,,,2019/02/16 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/omi.2018.0178 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2019 Feb;23(2):119-130. doi: 10.1089/omi.2018.0178.,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*arsenic trioxide', '*biomarkers', '*precision medicine', '*proteomics', '*therapeutic drug monitoring']",,,,,,20200406,IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Filaggrin Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Precision Medicine', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (FLG protein, human)', '0 (Filaggrin Proteins)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination adequately describes imatinib pharmacokinetics. Actual bodyweight shows slight effect on the estimated apparent clearance (CL/F) of imatinib in this study population. The final PPK model is: Ka (1/h) = 0.329; CL/F (l/h) = 9.25 x (actual bodyweight/70)(0.228); V/F(l) = 222. CONCLUSION: Actual bodyweight has a slight effect on CL/F.

However, outcomes after ibrutinib discontinuation have previously been limited to higher-risk populations with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes of ibrutinib-treated patients based on prior lines of therapy, including after ibrutinib discontinuation. Data were analyzed from two multicenter phase 3 studies of single-agent ibrutinib: RESONATE (PCYC-1112) in patients with R/R CLL and RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115) in patients with treatment-naive (TN) CLL without del(17p). This integrated analysis included 271 ibrutinib-treated non-del(17p) patients with CLL (136 TN and 135 R/R). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for subgroups with 0 and 1/2 prior therapies but was 40.6 months for patients with >/=3 therapies (median follow-up: TN, 36 months; R/R, 44 months). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached in any subgroup. Overall response rate (ORR) was 92% in TN and 92% in R/R, with depth of response increasing over time. Adverse events (AEs) and ibrutinib discontinuation due to AEs were similar between patient groups. Most patients (64%) remain on treatment. OS following discontinuation was 9.3 months in R/R patients (median follow-up 18 months, n = 51) and was not reached in TN patients (median follow-up 10 months, n = 30). In this integrated analysis, ibrutinib was associated with favorable PFS and OS, and high ORR regardless of prior therapies in patients with CLL. The best outcomes following ibrutinib discontinuation were for patients receiving ibrutinib in earlier lines of therapy.","[""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Byrd, John C', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Coutre, Steven', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Reddy, Nishitha M', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Chang, Stephen', 'Ninomoto, Joi', 'James, Danelle F', 'Burger, Jan A']","[""O'Brien SM"", 'Byrd JC', 'Hillmen P', 'Coutre S', 'Brown JR', 'Barr PM', 'Barrientos JC', 'Devereux S', 'Robak T', 'Reddy NM', 'Kipps TJ', 'Tedeschi A', 'Cymbalista F', 'Ghia P', 'Chang S', 'Ninomoto J', 'James DF', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio.', ""Department of Haematology, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematological Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Medicine, Division of Cancer Studies, Kings College Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, UC San Diego Health, Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, California.', 'Department of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Niguarda Ca Granda, Milan, Italy.', 'Service Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Avicenne, Universite Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Strategic Research Program in CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, Universite Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Biostatistics, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Clinical Science, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Clinical Science, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190308,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,PMC6593416,,2019/02/16 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25436 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 May;94(5):554-562. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25436.

A revision was necessary because of two positive aspects: First, new data and insights on risk stratification and monitoring, and second, the clinical development and approval of new agents. The modified genetic risk classification allows a more precise distinction of different diagnostic groups and consequently a better matched post-remission treatment. The availability of new targeted drugs such as inhibitors turns genetic analyses from a mere prognostic tool into an instrument for treatment decisions. Several recently approved agents expand the treatment options for AML and raise hope for an improved prognosis and cure in the future.","['Rollig, Christoph']",['Rollig C'],"['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum TU Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, 01307, Dresden, Deutschland. christoph.roellig@uniklinikum-dresden.de.']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,,,2019/02/16 06:00,2019/10/02 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00108-019-0562-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00108-019-0562-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Internist (Berl). 2019 Mar;60(3):257-272. doi: 10.1007/s00108-019-0562-2.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CPX-351', '*Gemtuzumab', '*Midostaurin', '*Molecular targeted therapy', '*Risk, stratification']",,,,,,20191001,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/therapy', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,Diagnostik und Therapie der akuten myeloischen Leukamie : Die Neufassung der Onkopedia-Leitlinie 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic role of expression of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) gene, which behaves as a multidrug transporter, in adult AML is ambiguous. Objective: The objective is to assess the level of mRNA expression of BCRP gene in newly diagnosed cytogenetically normal adult Egyptian AML patients; and to clarify its potential influence and association between therapeutic responsiveness and disease free survival. Methods: The BCRP gene expression was evaluated by quantifying its mRNA using real time RT-PCR in fifty newly diagnosed cytogenetically normal adult AML patients and 20 healthy normal controls. The expression was evaluated in relation to clinical and prognostic factors, response to treatment and the survival rate. Results: BCRP mRNA was over expressed in adult AML patients compared to controls. This study showed a positive statistical correlation between BCRP gene expression and the percent of CD34 expression. Statistical analysis did not reveal any association between BCRP expression level and chemotherapeutic responsiveness or disease free survival rate. Conclusion: The significance of BCRP gene expression and its function in AML is very complicated, therefore more standardized clinical studies are needed.","['El-Masry, Manal W', 'Gouda, Heba M', 'Shaheen, Iman A', 'Edesa, Wael', 'Hassan, Naglaa M', 'Ramzy, Rehab']","['El-Masry MW', 'Gouda HM', 'Shaheen IA', 'Edesa W', 'Hassan NM', 'Ramzy R']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Uganda,Afr Health Sci,African health sciences,101149451,PMC6354849,,2019/02/16 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4314/ahs.v18i4.15 [doi]', 'jAFHS.v18.i4.pg958 [pii]']",ppublish,Afr Health Sci. 2018 Dec;18(4):958-964. doi: 10.4314/ahs.v18i4.15.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCRP', 'Egypt', 'adult AML', 'gene expression', 'prognosis']",,,,,,20190610,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']","['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine combination in acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases scheduled for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Retrospective analysis of data from 40 cases who underwent allogeneic HSCT under GvHD prophylaxis with cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine combination between April 2016 and August 2017 was made. Cyclophosphamide was given at daily doses of 50 mg/kg on post-transplant 3(rd) and 4(th) days, and cyclosporine was applied at daily doses of 3 mg/kg/day starting from the 5(th) post-transplant day. Cyclosporine dose was tapered beginning from the 45(th) postoperative day and completely discontinued on the 90(th) post-transplant day. Mean age was 38.25 +/- 15.25 years. Posttransplant median follow-up was six months (6-17 months). Post-transplant, the number of deaths and mortality rates related and unrelated to transplantation were 5 (12.5%), and 2 (5%), respectively. Acute GvHD was diagnosed in 7 cases (17.5%), and relapse was noted in 9 cases (22.5%). Myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning was performed in 22 (55%) and 18 (45%) patients, respectively. The distribution of the donors was as follows: match-related (n = 26; 65%), match-unrelated (n = 9, 22.5%) and haploidentical donors (n = 5; 12.5%).

However, its application to studying cancerous tissues is currently hampered by the lack of coverage across key mutation hotspots in the vast majority of cells; this lack of coverage prevents the correlation of genetic and transcriptional readouts from the same single cell. To overcome this, we developed TARGET-seq, a method for the high-sensitivity detection of multiple mutations within single cells from both genomic and coding DNA, in parallel with unbiased whole-transcriptome analysis. Applying TARGET-seq to 4,559 single cells, we demonstrate how this technique uniquely resolves transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) stem and progenitor cells, providing insights into deregulated pathways of mutant and non-mutant cells. TARGET-seq is a powerful tool for resolving the molecular signatures of genetically distinct subclones of cancer cells.","['Rodriguez-Meira, Alba', 'Buck, Gemma', 'Clark, Sally-Ann', 'Povinelli, Benjamin J', 'Alcolea, Veronica', 'Louka, Eleni', 'McGowan, Simon', 'Hamblin, Angela', 'Sousos, Nikolaos', 'Barkas, Nikolaos', 'Giustacchini, Alice', 'Psaila, Bethan', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W', 'Thongjuea, Supat', 'Mead, Adam J']","['Rodriguez-Meira A', 'Buck G', 'Clark SA', 'Povinelli BJ', 'Alcolea V', 'Louka E', 'McGowan S', 'Hamblin A', 'Sousos N', 'Barkas N', 'Giustacchini A', 'Psaila B', 'Jacobsen SEW', 'Thongjuea S', 'Mead AJ']","['Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK;

Altered circle RNAs (circRNAs) could contribute to leukemogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiling of circRNAs in CML. We performed circRNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in CML cells. Furthermore, we found that circ_100053 was significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum samples from CML compared with healthy controls. CircRNA_100053 expression was associated with clinical stage (p=0.037) and BCR/ABL mutant status (p=0.008). High circ_100053 expression predicted a poor outcome of CML patients and imatinib resistance, suggesting the putative role of circ_100053 as an CML biomarker.

Thus, the discovery of new molecular players in cell differentiation becomes a paramount research area to achieve this goal. Here, the involvement of the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 on leukemic cells differentiation is shown, along with the therapeutic possibilities of their targeting to enhance the differentiation induction effect of phorbol esters. METHODS: The oxidation status and enzymatic activity of SHP1 and SHP2 during PMA-induced differentiation of HEL cells was evaluated. Additionally, the effects of RNAi-mediated downregulation of these phosphatases on cell differentiation was studied. Afterwards, the impact of chemical inhibition of SHP1 and SHP2 on differentiation both in the presence and absence of phorbol esters was tested. Finally, the anti-leukemic potential of phorbol esters and chemical inhibitors of SHP1 and SHP2 was addressed in several AML model cell lines, a xenograft mouse model and AML primary cells in vitro. RESULTS: An increase of oxidation with a concomitant decrease of activity was observed for both phosphatases at the onset of PMA-induced differentiation. Consistently, silencing of these proteins favored the process, with an enhanced effect upon their simultaneous downregulation. Moreover, the proteins SRC and beta-catenin were identified as downstream targets of SHP1 and SHP2 in this context. In agreement with these findings, chemical inhibition of the phosphatases promoted cell differentiation itself and enhanced the effect of phorbol esters. Interestingly, treatment with the phorbol ester prostratin and the dual inhibitor of SHP1 and SHP2 NSC87877 synergistically hampered the proliferation of AML cell lines, prolonged the survival of xenografted mice and reduced the clonogenic potential of AML primary cells. CONCLUSIONS: SHP1 and SHP2 are relevant mediators of differentiation in AML cells and their inhibition either alone or in combination with prostratin seems a promising differentiation-based therapeutic strategy against different subtypes of AML beyond APL.","['Perez-Fernandez, Alejandro', 'Lopez-Ruano, Guillermo', 'Prieto-Bermejo, Rodrigo', 'Ijurko, Carla', 'Diez-Campelo, Maria', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Hernandez-Hernandez, Angel']","['Perez-Fernandez A', 'Lopez-Ruano G', 'Prieto-Bermejo R', 'Ijurko C', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Hernandez-Hernandez A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Salamanca, Edificio Departamental, Lab 122, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, S/N, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Virgen de la Vega Hospital, 10th floor, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Salamanca, Edificio Departamental, Lab 122, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, S/N, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Virgen de la Vega Hospital, 10th floor, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Salamanca, Edificio Departamental, Lab 122, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, S/N, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Virgen de la Vega Hospital, 10th floor, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Salamanca, Edificio Departamental, Lab 122, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, S/N, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Virgen de la Vega Hospital, 10th floor, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Virgen de la Vega Hospital, 10th floor, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente, 139, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Virgen de la Vega Hospital, 10th floor, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente, 139, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Salamanca, Edificio Departamental, Lab 122, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, S/N, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain. angelhh@usal.es.', 'IBSAL, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Virgen de la Vega Hospital, 10th floor, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, P.O. 37007, Salamanca, Spain. angelhh@usal.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190214,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC6376690,,2019/02/16 06:00,2019/05/30 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-019-1097-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-019-1097-z [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Feb 14;38(1):80. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1097-z.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cell differentiation', 'Phorbol esters', 'Pro-differentiating therapy', 'SHP1', 'SHP2']","['BFU2014-56490-R/MINECO', 'CIV17A2822/Fundacion Ramon Areces']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0827-7963'],,,20190529,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying this improvement have yet to be elucidated. In vitro studies have reported that RA upregulates thrombomodulin (TM) expression on the endothelial cell surface. The objective of this study was to investigate how and to what extent the TM concentration changes after RA treatment in cancer patients, and how this variation influences the blood coagulation cascade. RESULTS: In this study, we introduced an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of gene expression for the RA-induced upregulation of TM concentration. Coupling the gene expression model with a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model of RA, we obtained the time-dependent changes in TM and thrombomodulin-mRNA (TMR) concentrations following oral administration of RA. Our results indicated that the TM concentration reached its peak level almost 14 h after taking a single oral dose (110 [Formula: see text]) of RA. Continuous treatment with RA resulted in oscillatory expression of TM on the endothelial cell surface. We then coupled the gene expression model with a mechanistic model of the coagulation cascade, and showed that the elevated levels of TM over the course of RA therapy with a single daily oral dose (110 [Formula: see text]) of RA, reduced the peak thrombin levels and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) up to 50 and 49%, respectively. We showed that progressive reductions in plasma levels of RA, observed in continuous RA therapy with a once-daily oral dose (110 [Formula: see text]) of RA, did not affect TM-mediated reduction of thrombin generation significantly. This finding prompts the hypothesis that continuous RA treatment has more consistent therapeutic effects on coagulation disorders than on cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the oscillatory upregulation of TM expression on the endothelial cells over the course of RA therapy could potentially contribute to the treatment of coagulation abnormalities in cancer patients. Further studies on the impacts of RA therapy on the procoagulant activity of cancer cells are needed to better elucidate the mechanisms by which RA therapy improves hemostatic abnormalities in cancer.","['Ghaffari, Hamed', 'Varner, Jeffrey D', 'Petzold, Linda R']","['Ghaffari H', 'Varner JD', 'Petzold LR']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, USA. hamed_ghaffari@umail.ucsb.edu.', 'School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190214,England,Theor Biol Med Model,Theoretical biology & medical modelling,101224383,PMC6376718,,2019/02/16 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2019/02/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12976-019-0099-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12976-019-0099-z [pii]']",epublish,Theor Biol Med Model. 2019 Feb 14;16(1):3. doi: 10.1186/s12976-019-0099-z.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*All-trans retinoic acid', '*Disseminated intravascular coagulation', '*Mathematical model', '*Pharmacodynamics', '*Pharmacokinetics', '*Thrombomodulin']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6673-593X'],,,20190318,IM,"['Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computer Simulation', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Thrombomodulin/blood/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']","['0 (Thrombomodulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCL is characterized by the presence of clonal plasma cells in peripheral blood. There are two forms of PCL - primary which presents de novo in patients with no evidence of previous multiple myeloma and secondary which is a leukemic transformation of relapsed or refractory dis-ease in patients with previously recognized multiple myeloma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is the first study to provide information on PCL epidemiology in the Czech population us-ing The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) as the basic source of data for the population-based evaluation of PCL epidemiology. RESULTS: Accord-ing to CNCR data, there were on average six newly dia-gnosed cases of PCL and four deaths caused by PCL each year in the Czech Republic in the period 2000-&#8202;2015. PCL incidence in the Czech Republic was reported at 0.57 per million in 2000-&#8202;2015. We suppose that most reported cases of PCL are primary PCL because secondary PCL is a relapse of a previously reported myeloma and, in most cases, is not coded as an independent dia-gnosis in the CNCR. CONCLUSION: Data from registries such as the CNCR can provide useful information on epidemiology of various dis-eases. These data, however, have several limitations, such as dia-gnostic criteria and proper cod-ing of not only the dis-ease itself, but also its various forms. These limitations have to be taken into account dur-ing the process of results interpretation.

It is classified into two forms -&#8202; primary PCL that occurs without a previously identifiable multiple myeloma stage, and secondary PCL that develops from previously dia-gnosed multiple myeloma. These two forms have different cytogenetic and molecular profiles, but both forms have an aggressive clinical course. Combinations of different therapeutic approaches includ-ing autologous stem cell transplantation and currently proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs are used to treat PCL. Current dia-gnostic criteria, developed in the 1970s, may underestimate PCL prevalence; thus, prospective re-evaluation is be-ing considered. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to review all available information about PCL with an emphasis on dia-gnostics, treatment, and circulat-ing plasma cells features. CONCLUSION: Although PCL is rare, it is quite a severe dis-ease. Current treatments us-ing the latest therapeutics have prolonged patient survival. However, due to the low incidence of PCL, information about the dis-ease is very limited and comes mostly from small retrospective studies. Further studies of PCL are needed, because new information could increase in patient survival and our understand-ing of its pathogenesis.

The genetic landscape of T-ALL has been largely characterized by next-generation sequencing. Yet, the transcriptome of miRNAs (miRNome) of T-ALL has been less extensively studied. Using small RNA sequencing, we characterized the miRNome of 34 pediatric T-ALL samples, including the expression of isomiRs and the identification of candidate novel miRNAs (not previously annotated in miRBase). For the first time, we show that immunophenotypic subtypes of T-ALL present different miRNA expression profiles. To extend miRNome characteristics in T-ALL (to 82T-ALL cases), we combined our small RNA-seq results with data available in Gene Expression Omnibus. We report on miRNAs most abundantly expressed in pediatric T-ALL and miRNAs differentially expressed in T-ALL versus normal mature T-lymphocytes and thymocytes, representing candidate oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs. Using eight target prediction algorithms and pathway enrichment analysis, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted targets implicated in processes (defined in Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) of potential importance in pathogenesis of T-ALL, including interleukin-6-mediated signaling, mTOR signaling, and regulation of apoptosis. We finally focused on hsa-mir-106a-363 cluster and functionally validated direct interactions of hsa-miR-20b-5p and hsa-miR-363-3p with 3' untranslated regions of their predicted targets (PTEN, SOS1, LATS2), overrepresented in regulation of apoptosis. hsa-mir-106a-363 is a paralogue of prototypic oncogenic hsa-mir-17-92 cluster with yet unestablished role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. Our study provides a firm basis and data resource for functional analyses on the role of miRNA-mRNA interactions in T-ALL.","['Dawidowska, Malgorzata', 'Jaksik, Roman', 'Drobna, Monika', 'Szarzynska-Zawadzka, Bronislawa', 'Kosmalska, Maria', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'Machowska, Ludomila', 'Lalik, Anna', 'Lejman, Monika', 'Ussowicz, Marek', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Witt, Michal']","['Dawidowska M', 'Jaksik R', 'Drobna M', 'Szarzynska-Zawadzka B', 'Kosmalska M', 'Sedek L', 'Machowska L', 'Lalik A', 'Lejman M', 'Ussowicz M', 'Kalwak K', 'Kowalczyk JR', 'Szczepanski T', 'Witt M']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland.

Herein, in an independent cohort of Sardinian ASD (sASD) children and their relatives, we verify whether HLA-G allele association with ASD could be confirmed in this genetically peculiar insular population. One hundred children with a diagnosis of ASD, born in Sardinia and of Sardinian descent, 91 of their mothers, and 40 of their healthy siblings were enrolled. DNA sequencing analysis of HLA-G exon 2, 3 and 4 was used to obtain HLA-G allelic frequencies. Alleles distribution was compared with that of continental ASD children and with a control group of Caucasoid couples of multiparous women and their partners from Brazil and Denmark. Skewing of HLA-G allele distribution was replicated in sASD children; in particular, the HLA-G*01:03 allele, associated with reduced fetal tolerogenicity and development of myeloid leukemia, was more common in both ASD groups compared to controls (pc=1x10(-3); OR:3.5, 95%CI: 1.8-6.8). However, given the lack of data on HLA-G*01:03 allelic distribution among Sardinian healthy subjects, we cannot exclude a population effect. These data confirm an association of HLA-G locus with ASD development, particularly with those alleles linked to a lower expression of tolerogenic HLA-G protein, thus warranting further studies on HLA-G polymorphism distribution in different ASD populations.","['Guerini, Franca R', 'Bolognesi, Elisabetta', 'Sotgiu, Stefano', 'Carta, Alessandra', 'Clerici, Claudia', 'Chiappedi, Matteo', 'Ghezzo, Alessandro', 'Zanette, Michela', 'Mensi, Maria M', 'Canevini, Maria P', 'Zanzottera, Milena', 'Agliardi, Cristina', 'Costa, Andrea S', 'Balottin, Umberto', 'Clerici, Mario']","['Guerini FR', 'Bolognesi E', 'Sotgiu S', 'Carta A', 'Clerici C', 'Chiappedi M', 'Ghezzo A', 'Zanette M', 'Mensi MM', 'Canevini MP', 'Zanzottera M', 'Agliardi C', 'Costa AS', 'Balottin U', 'Clerici M']","['IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Milano, Italy.

The bone marrow stroma can protect AML cells from insults of chemotherapy, partly contributing to AML relapse. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is the main component of arsenical traditional Chinese medicines and has been widely used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia over the past three decades. ATO acts through a direct arsenic binding to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), thus killing the leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Our prior study has demonstrated that adhesion to stroma cells could render AML cells resistant to ATO but the detailed mechanism remains to be explored. Here, we report that the adhesion-induced resistance to ATO is related to the up-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Homoharringtonine (HHT) can potentiate the anti-leukemia effects of ATO on adhered AML cells by suppressing Mcl-1 through glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta). Furthermore, a potentiating effect of HHT on ATO was also observed in primary AML cells and AML xenografted tumors. Thus, these data indicate that HHT could enhance ATO anti-leukemia activity both in vitro and in vivo.","['Chen, Ping', 'Zhan, Weiwu', 'Wang, Bin', 'You, Peidong', 'Jin, Qing', 'Hou, Diyu', 'Wang, Xiaoting', 'You, Ruolan', 'Zou, Hong', 'Chen, Yuanzhong', 'Huang, Huifang']","['Chen P', 'Zhan W', 'Wang B', 'You P', 'Jin Q', 'Hou D', 'Wang X', 'You R', 'Zou H', 'Chen Y', 'Huang H']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, The Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.

Conventional chemotherapy approaches have generally yielded unsatisfactory results in older patients with ALL as a result of excessive induction mortality, chemotherapy resistance of the leukemia, and the need to omit or dose reduce key drugs during the course of therapy because of adverse effects. Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL represents about a quarter of newly diagnosed older adults, and the striking single-agent activity and excellent safety profile of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has allowed incorporation of these agents into therapy, significantly improving the outcome of older adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using reduced-intensity conditioning is a potentially curative approach in the older adult with ALL, and ironically, it may be better tolerated than intensive combination chemotherapy in a subset of older patients with ALL. Immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells, the bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody targeting CD19 (blinatumomab), and the antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD22 (inotuzumab) have shown safety and exceptional activity even in advanced ALL, and the efficacy of these agents has been observed irrespective of patient age. Several promising studies tailored specifically toward older adults with ALL are ongoing, with the majority of them incorporating novel immunotherapies, targeted therapies, or third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors into the front-line treatment regimen.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Forman SJ', 'Pullarkat V']","['1 Gehr Family Leukemia Research Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', '1 Gehr Family Leukemia Research Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', '1 Gehr Family Leukemia Research Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,,2019/02/15 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JOP.18.00271 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2019 Feb;15(2):67-75. doi: 10.1200/JOP.18.00271.,,,,,,,,20200318,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Recurrence']",,,,,,,['J Oncol Pract. 2019 Feb;15(2):77-79.

The complexes with the longest excited-state lifetimes, contributed by low-lying (3)IL states, were the most phototoxic toward cancer cells under all conditions.","['Reichardt, Christian', 'Monro, Susan', 'Sobotta, Fabian H', 'Colon, Katsuya L', 'Sainuddin, Tariq', 'Stephenson, Mat', 'Sampson, Eric', 'Roque, John 3rd', 'Yin, Huimin', 'Brendel, Johannes C', 'Cameron, Colin G', 'McFarland, Sherri', 'Dietzek, Benjamin']","['Reichardt C', 'Monro S', 'Sobotta FH', 'Colon KL', 'Sainuddin T', 'Stephenson M', 'Sampson E', 'Roque J 3rd', 'Yin H', 'Brendel JC', 'Cameron CG', 'McFarland S', 'Dietzek B']","['Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (IPHT) Jena , Department Functional Interfaces , Albert-Einstein-Strasse 9 , 07745 Jena , Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry , Acadia University , Wolfville , Nova Scotia B4P 2R6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , The University of North Carolina at Greensboro , Greensboro , North Carolina 27402 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , Acadia University , Wolfville , Nova Scotia B4P 2R6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry , Acadia University , Wolfville , Nova Scotia B4P 2R6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry , Acadia University , Wolfville , Nova Scotia B4P 2R6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , The University of North Carolina at Greensboro , Greensboro , North Carolina 27402 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , Acadia University , Wolfville , Nova Scotia B4P 2R6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , The University of North Carolina at Greensboro , Greensboro , North Carolina 27402 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , Acadia University , Wolfville , Nova Scotia B4P 2R6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , The University of North Carolina at Greensboro , Greensboro , North Carolina 27402 , United States.', 'Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (IPHT) Jena , Department Functional Interfaces , Albert-Einstein-Strasse 9 , 07745 Jena , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190214,United States,Inorg Chem,Inorganic chemistry,0366543,PMC6500734,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/03/15 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b03223 [doi]'],ppublish,Inorg Chem. 2019 Mar 4;58(5):3156-3166. doi: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b03223.

Previously, we discovered a novel form of cancer drug resistance where the Glioma-associated protein 1 (GLI1) elevates UGT1A glucuronidation enzymes, thereby glucuronidating cytarabine and ribavirin, leading to resistance in leukemia patients. Here, we demonstrate that GLI1 imparts resistance to approximately 40 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs with disparate chemotypes ( e.g., methotrexate and venetoclax). GLI1 indirectly elevates UGT1As via the chaperone calreticulin, which is required for resistance. Further, we demonstrate that resistant cells are more sensitive to ATP inhibitors, suggesting an Achilles' heel, which could be exploited in the future. In all, we identify GLI1-inducible glucuronidation as a broad-spectrum multidrug resistance pathway.","['Zahreddine, Hiba Ahmad', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic, Biljana', 'Gasiorek, Jadwiga', 'Duchaine, Jean', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Zahreddine HA', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic B', 'Gasiorek J', 'Duchaine J', 'Borden KLB']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology , Universite de Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology , Universite de Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology , Universite de Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology , Universite de Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology , Universite de Montreal , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190219,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.8b01118 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2019 Mar 15;14(3):348-355. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.8b01118.

In order to provide a basis for clinical safe blood transfusion, the data of 163 cases with cALL were retrospectively analyzed to explore the issue.The data of 163 cases with cALL between 2006 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the frequency of blood transfusion, the 163 cases were divided into 4 groups including non-transfusion group, 1 to 10-time transfusion group, 11 to 25-time transfusion group, and >25-time transfusion group. Survival rates were compared with Log-Rank test. Cox regression analysis was used in the effects of risk factors on recurrence and death.ABT was performed in 152 cases with cALL (93.25%). In low-risk and intermediate-and-high risk cALL, the survival rate significantly decreased in all transfusion groups compared with that in non-transfusion group (all P < .01). Cox regression analysis showed that >25-time transfusion was an independent prognosis index of recurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 3.015, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.368-6.646) and death (OR = 3.979, 95% CI: 1.930-8.207) in cALL.Frequency of ABT appears to affect the recurrence and death in cALL.

Due to this mechanism of action observed, L-asparaginase is widely used in the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, since these cells use asparagine for their survival. Because it is frequently used as an antineoplastic, it is necessary to evaluate its genotoxic effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate cellular DNA damage after exposure to L-asparaginase produced by Streptomyces ansochromogenes UFPEDA 3420. NCIH-292, MCF-7 and MOLT-4 neoplastic cell lines and normal PBMC cells were used. L-Asparaginase used in this study was produced by actinobacteria S. ansochromogenes UFPEDA 3420, isolated and purified by chromatographic methods. L-Asparaginase induced micronucleus formation in PBMC cells and tumor lines when compared to the negative control. These data suggest that L-Asp appears to have a genotoxic effect very close to the positive control in normal cells (p < 0.05). The level of genomic damage measured by DNA breaks in alkaline SCGE assay was detected from the lowest concentration (12.5 microg/mL) to the highest concentration (50 microg/mL) for tumor cell lines and PBMC. In view of the above, new genotoxic studies will be carried out to better elucidate L-Asparaginase and its mutagenic potential, still unknown, enough for this drug to be safely used in conventional antineoplastic therapies.","['da Silva Lacerda, Glezia Renata', 'Cantalice, Jeanne Cristina Lapenda Lins', 'de Souza Lima, Glaucia Manoella', 'de Albuquerque, Luiz Eduardo Felix', ""da Silva, Isllan D'Erik Goncalves"", 'de Melo, Maria Eliane Bezerra', 'Adam, Monica Lucia', 'do Nascimento, Silene Carneiro']","['da Silva Lacerda GR', 'Cantalice JCLL', 'de Souza Lima GM', 'de Albuquerque LEF', 'da Silva IDG', 'de Melo MEB', 'Adam ML', 'do Nascimento SC']","['Laboratory of Microorganisms Collection, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Cell Culture Laboratory, Federal University of Pernambuco, Cidade Universitaria, Recife, PE, 52171-011, Brazil. jeannecantalice@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Microorganisms Collection, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Microorganisms Collection, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Microorganisms Collection, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Parasitology, Laboratory of Mutagenesis, Aggeu Magalhaes Research Center, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Cell Culture Laboratory, Federal University of Pernambuco, Cidade Universitaria, Recife, PE, 52171-011, Brazil.', 'Department of Animal Biology, Laboratory of Evolutionary and Ambient Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190214,Germany,World J Microbiol Biotechnol,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,9012472,,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11274-019-2612-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11274-019-2612-2 [pii]']",epublish,World J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2019 Feb 14;35(3):41. doi: 10.1007/s11274-019-2612-2.,['NOTNLM'],"['Genotoxicity', 'Human and normal tumor cell lines', 'L-Asparaginase']",,,,,,20190225,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Assays', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Streptomyces/*enzymology/*metabolism']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood specimens were subjected to platelet measurements by evaluated methods and then compared against the international reference method (IRM). Eighty-two blood specimens were included. Bland-Altman plots of the differences between the evaluated methods and IRM demonstrated mean biases of PLT-LH, PLT-XNi and PLT-F of 9 x 10(9)/L, 11 x 10(9)/L and 2 x 10(9)/L, respectively. For platelet transfusion guidance, all evaluated methods had acceptable accuracy. For platelet transfusion guidance, the sensitivities of PLT-LH, PLT-XNi and PLT-F were 33.3, 25.0 and 83.3%, respectively, at a transfusion threshold of 10 x 10(9)/L, and 73.1, 61.5 and 84.6%, respectively, at transfusion threshold of 20 x 10(9)/L. High blast count was associated with inaccurate PLT-LH and PLT-XNi. In conclusion, the PLT-F demonstrated excellent performance for diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and for platelet transfusion guidance in the evaluated specimens from acute leukemia patients.

Tumor cells upregulate PD-L1 or PD-L2 to inhibit this T lymphocyte attack. Our goal was to determine the PD-1 and PD-L2 expression rates of various hematologic malignancies, and evaluate whether PD-1 and PD-L2 expressions have an impact on prognosis. Materials and methods: For this purpose, pretreatment bone marrow biopsy specimens of 83 patients [42 multiple myeloma (MM), 21 acute leukemia, and 20 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)] were stained with monoclonal antibody immunostains of PD-1 and PD-L2. Results: As a result, the overall expression rate of PD-1 was 26.2%, 4.8%, and 60% in patients with MM, acute leukemia, and CLL, respectively, whereas the PD-L2 expression rate was 61.9%, 14.3%, and 10% in patients with MM, acute leukemia, and CLL, respectively. Conclusion: Finally, we concluded that the role of the PD-1 pathway can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Since we evaluated whether there is a correlation between the (IHC) results and survival of patients with MM, acute leukemia, and CLL, we could not demonstrate meaningful evidence that these markers have an impact on prognosis.","['Korkmaz, Serdal', 'Erdem, Selahattin', 'Akay, Ebru', 'Tasdemir, Erdem Arzu', 'Karaman, Hatice', 'Keklik, Muzaffer']","['Korkmaz S', 'Erdem S', 'Akay E', 'Tasdemir EA', 'Karaman H', 'Keklik M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190211,Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,PMC7350792,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-1706-194 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2019 Feb 11;49(1):265-271. doi: 10.3906/sag-1706-194.,['NOTNLM'],"['*PD-1', '*PD-L2', '*multiple myeloma', '*acute leukemia', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5759-2735', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7804-9582', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1190-1800', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5183-6663', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5250-5663', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6426-5249']",,,20190513,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemistry/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein/*analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']","['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1LG2 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This BCR-ABL(+) myeloproliferative disease makes up about 15%-20% of all leukemia cases in adults. CML is seen more in males than females, with a rate of three to two. However, it does not show differences in prevalence in terms of age. CML consists of three clinical phases. The first one is the chronic phase, defined by rising white blood cell levels and also by myeloid proliferation and bone marrow maturation. While this phase does not exhibit complications, in diagnosis, it comprises most of the patients. The second phase is the accelerated phase, which the disease progresses to if it is not treated or does not respond to treatment. This usually takes about 3 years. The third phase is the blastic phase. The chronic phase can still progress to the next two phases within the first 2 years, with a rate of 10%. In the following years, the possibility increases by 15%-20% each year. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are revolutionary drugs for the management of disease course in CML. The aim of this review is to assess current approaches to CML patients' follow-up and treatment with TKIs. A literature search on CML and TKIs was made in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with particular focus on randomized clinical trials, recommendations, guidelines, and expert opinions. In managing CML, various treatment methods have been utilized for many decades. Prior to the development of TKIs, interferon alpha was the primary tool, which was then complemented by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT was successful in slowing the disease down in the long term and curing up to 50% of patients. Then the coming of the imatinib era opened up different treatment perspectives. For the patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs are successfully used in distinct CML disease states. The survival benefits of TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib for CML patients are outstanding. TKI-related adverse events could impact the clinical course, especially in long-term drug administrations. The current aim for CML disease management in the TKI era is to provide age- and sex-matched normal life duration to CML patients.","['Aladag, Elifcan', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin']","['Aladag E', 'Haznedaroglu IC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190211,Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,PMC7350850,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/04/24 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-1810-81 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2019 Feb 11;49(1):1-10. doi: 10.3906/sag-1810-81.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic', '*myeloid', '*leukemia', '*tyrosine', '*kinase', '*inhibitors']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1206-9908', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8028-9462']",,,20190423,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Retrospective study of concordance between locally reported renal tumor biopsies and central pathology review nephrectomy diagnoses of children enrolled by CCLG centers in the SIOP-WT-2001 study. RESULTS: Biopsy reports were available for 552/787 children with unilateral tumors. 36 of 552 (6.5%) were nondiagnostic: 2 normal tissue, 12 necrotic, 9 insufficient sample, and 13 indeterminate results (disproportionately non-WTs). The sensitivity and specificity of biopsy to identify tumors that did not require SIOP empirical preoperative chemotherapy were 86.0% and 99.6%, respectively. 13 of 548 (2.4%) biopsy results were discordant with nephrectomy; non-WTs other than renal cell carcinoma and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) were poorly recognized. In children aged 6-119 months, 480 of 518 (91.6%) had WT or nephroblastomatosis. 5 of 518 (1%) had benign tumors, and only one diagnosed on biopsy. Biopsy results correctly changed clinical management in 25 of 518 (4.8%), including identifying 19 of 20 CCSKs, but would have led to overtreatment in 5 of 518 (1%) or undertreatment in 4 of 518 (0.8%). In children aged >/=10 years, biopsy correctly changed management in 5 of 19 (26%) cases with no discordance. CONCLUSION: Biopsy is less effective at identifying non-WTs than WTs and rarely changes management in younger children. Biopsy should be reserved in SIOP protocols for children >/=10 years and in younger children with clinical or radiological features inconsistent with WT.","['Jackson, Thomas J', 'Williams, Richard D', 'Brok, Jesper', 'Chowdhury, Tanzina', 'Ronghe, Milind', 'Powis, Mark', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathy', 'Vujanic, Gordan M']","['Jackson TJ', 'Williams RD', 'Brok J', 'Chowdhury T', 'Ronghe M', 'Powis M', 'Pritchard-Jones K', 'Vujanic GM']","['University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Surgery, Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.', 'University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190213,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC6522371,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2018/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27627 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27627. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27627.

The mechanism of implantation is exclusively under the control of ovarian steroids progesterone and oestrogen whose actions are mediated in a complex phenomenon that involves a number of cytokines and growth factors. According to a plethora of literature on implantation in mammalian species, prominent of these cytokines and growth factor playing crucial roles in implantation include integrin, osteopontin, integrin, insulin-like growth factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor. Others are cluster domain 44, hyaluronan system and many non-adhesive molecules such as glycoprotein mucin 1. In this review, the specific roles played by these molecules are expatiated. Generally, they function as adhesive molecules that facilitate attachment of ligands/proteins on the trophectoderm to their respective receptors on endometrial luminal epithelia or vice versa. Sometimes, they also function as signalling molecules that enhance communication between implanting blastocyst and receptive endometrium. This is of particular importance in embryo culture and embryo transfer where in vitro derived blastocyst unlike the in vivo condition, is not exposed to these substances and hence, their absence may be partly responsible for the low implantation rate observed in the surrogate. Appreciation of the roles played by these cytokines, growth factors and molecules as revealed in this review will spur further research on these topics, facilitate their inclusion in embryo culture media (if positively required) and are considered as vital aspect while developing strategies to improve fertility.","['Raheem, Kabir A']",['Raheem KA'],"['Dept. of Theriogenology, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171219,United States,Int J Vet Sci Med,International journal of veterinary science and medicine,101626221,PMC6161864,,2017/12/19 00:00,2017/12/19 00:01,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2017/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ijvsm.2017.12.001 [doi]', 'S2314-4599(17)30112-6 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Vet Sci Med. 2017 Dec 19;6(Suppl):S6-S14. doi: 10.1016/j.ijvsm.2017.12.001. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['Hyaluronan', 'Implantation', 'Integrin', 'Mucin', 'Osteopontin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS and AML cells present genetic and epigenetic abnormalities and, due to the heterogeneity of these molecular alterations, the current treatment options remain unsatisfactory. Hypomethylating agents (HMA), especially azacitidine, are the mainstay of treatment for high-risk MDS patients and HMA are used in treating elderly AML. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of the epigenetic reader bromodomain-containing protein-4 (BRD4) in MDS and AML patients. We identified the upregulation of the short variant BRD4 in MDS and AML patients, which was associated with a worse outcome of MDS. Furthermore, the inhibition of BRD4 in vitro with JQ1 or shRNA induced leukemia cell apoptosis, especially when combined to azacitidine, and triggered the activation of the DNA damage response pathway. JQ1 and AZD6738 (a specific ATR inhibitor) also synergized to induce apoptosis in leukemia cells. Our results indicate that the BRD4-dependent transcriptional program is a defective pathway in MDS and AML pathogenesis and its inhibition induces apoptosis of leukemia cells, which is enhanced in combination with HMA or an ATR inhibitor.","['Pericole, Fernando Vieira', 'Lazarini, Mariana', 'de Paiva, Luciana Bueno', 'Duarte, Adriana da Silva Santos', 'Vieira Ferro, Karla Priscila', 'Niemann, Fernanda Soares', 'Roversi, Fernanda Marconi', 'Olalla Saad, Sara Teresinha']","['Pericole FV', 'Lazarini M', 'de Paiva LB', 'Duarte ADSS', 'Vieira Ferro KP', 'Niemann FS', 'Roversi FM', 'Olalla Saad ST']","['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade Sao Francisco (USF), Braganca Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, University of Campinas, Hemocentro-Unicamp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190129,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC6361844,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/02/15 06:01,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00016 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jan 29;9:16. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00016. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['AZD6738', 'BET member of bromodomain-containing proteins', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that priming natural killer (NK) cells isolated from healthy individuals via co-incubation with CTV-1 cells derived from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) enhances their cytotoxicity against human DU145 (metastatic) prostate cancer cells, but it remains unknown to what extent NK cells from patients with prostate cancer can be triggered to kill. Herein, we explore the phenotype of peripheral blood NK cells in patients with prostate cancer and compare the capacity of CTV-1 cell-mediated priming and IL-2 stimulation to trigger NK cell-mediated killing of the human PC3 (metastatic) prostate cancer cell line. Methods: The phenotype of resting, primed (co-incubation with CTV-1 cells for 17 h) and IL-2 activated (100 IU/ml IL-2 for 17 h) NK cells isolated from frozen-thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations from patients with benign disease (n = 6) and prostate cancer (n = 18) and their cytotoxicity against PC3 and K562 cells was determined by flow cytometry. Relationship(s) between NK cell phenotypic features and cytotoxic potential were interrogated using Spearman Rank correlation matrices. Results and Conclusions: NK cell priming and IL-2 activation of patient-derived NK cells resulted in similar levels of cytotoxicity, but distinct NK cell phenotypes. Importantly, the capacity of priming and IL-2 stimulation to trigger cytotoxicity was patient-dependent and mutually exclusive, in that NK cells from ~50% of patients preferentially responded to priming whereas NK cells from the remaining patients preferentially responded to cytokine stimulation. In addition to providing more insight into the biology of primed and cytokine-stimulated NK cells, this study supports the use of autologous NK cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, our findings also indicate that patients will need to be stratified according to their potential responsiveness to individual therapeutic approaches.","['Hood, Simon P', 'Foulds, Gemma A', 'Imrie, Heather', 'Reeder, Stephen', 'McArdle, Stephanie E B', 'Khan, Masood', 'Pockley, Alan Graham']","['Hood SP', 'Foulds GA', 'Imrie H', 'Reeder S', 'McArdle SEB', 'Khan M', 'Pockley AG']","['John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'School of Animal Rural and Environmental Sciences, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Urology, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190125,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC6362408,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/10/15 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03169 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jan 25;9:3169. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03169. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CTV-1', '*TNF receptors', '*cancer', '*cytotoxicity', '*natural killer (NK) cells', '*phenotype', '*priming', '*prostate']",,,,,,20191014,IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) lenalidomide promotes myeloma cell death via Cereblon (CRBN)-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Although IMiDs have been used as first-line drugs for MM, the overall survival of refractory MM patients remains poor and demands the identification of novel agents to potentiate the therapeutic effect of IMiDs. Using an unbiased screen based on mass spectrometry, we identified the Runt-related transcription factor 1 and 3 (RUNX1 and RUNX3) as interactors of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Interaction with RUNX1 and RUNX3 inhibits CRBN-dependent binding, ubiquitylation, and degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 upon lenalidomide treatment. Inhibition of RUNXs, via genetic ablation or a small molecule (AI-10-104), results in sensitization of myeloma cell lines and primary tumors to lenalidomide. Thus, RUNX inhibition represents a valuable therapeutic opportunity to potentiate IMiDs therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['Zhou, Nan', 'Gutierrez-Uzquiza, Alvaro', 'Zheng, Xiang Yu', 'Chang, Renxu', 'Vogl, Dan T', 'Garfall, Alfred L', 'Bernabei, Luca', 'Saraf, Anita', 'Florens, Laurence', 'Washburn, Michael P', 'Illendula, Anuradha', 'Bushweller, John H', 'Busino, Luca']","['Zhou N', 'Gutierrez-Uzquiza A', 'Zheng XY', 'Chang R', 'Vogl DT', 'Garfall AL', 'Bernabei L', 'Saraf A', 'Florens L', 'Washburn MP', 'Illendula A', 'Bushweller JH', 'Busino L']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, USA.', 'The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, USA.', 'The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. businol@upenn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6687534,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0403-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0403-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):2006-2021. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0403-2.

While certain mutations have been associated with the increased risk of AML relapse, the genomic landscape of primary chemotherapy-resistant AML is not well defined. As part of the TARGET initiative, we performed whole-genome DNA and transcriptome RNA and miRNA sequencing analysis of pediatric AML with failure of induction chemotherapy. We identified at least three genetic groups of patients with induction failure, including those with NUP98 rearrangements, somatic mutations of WT1 in the absence of apparent NUP98 mutations, and additional recurrent variants including those in KMT2C and MLLT10. Comparison of specimens before and after chemotherapy revealed distinct and invariant gene expression programs. While exhibiting overt therapy resistance, these leukemias nonetheless showed diverse forms of clonal evolution upon chemotherapy exposure.

To further explore the latter function, we studied whether MMP-9 influences the gene-expression profile in CLL. Microarray analyses rendered 131 differentially expressed genes in MEC-1 cells stably transfected with MMP-9 (MMP-9-cells) versus cells transfected with empty vector (Mock-cells). Ten out of twelve selected genes were also differentially expressed in MEC-1 cells expressing the catalytically inactive MMP-9MutE mutant (MMP-9MutE-cells). Incubation of primary CLL cells with MMP-9 or MMP-9MutE also regulated gene and protein expression, including CD99, CD226, CD52, and CD274. Because CD99 is involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration, we selected CD99 for functional and mechanistic studies. The link between MMP-9 and CD99 was reinforced with MMP-9 gene silencing studies, which resulted in CD99 upregulation. CD99 gene silencing significantly reduced CLL cell adhesion, chemotaxis and transendothelial migration, while CD99 overexpression increased cell migration. Mechanistic analyses indicated that MMP-9 downregulated CD99 via binding to alpha4beta1 integrin and subsequent inactivation of the Sp1 transcription factor. This MMP-9-induced mechanism is active in CLL lymphoid tissues, since CD99 expression and Sp1 phosphorylation was lower in bone marrow-derived CLL cells than in their peripheral blood counterparts. Our study establishes a new gene regulatory function for MMP-9 in CLL. It also identifies CD99 as an MMP-9 target and a novel contributor to CLL cell adhesion, migration and arrest. CD99 thus constitutes a new therapeutic target in CLL, complementary to MMP-9.","['Aguilera-Montilla, Noemi', 'Bailon, Elvira', 'Uceda-Castro, Rebeca', 'Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Santos, Andrea', 'Gutierrez-Gonzalez, Alejandra', 'Perez-Sanchez, Cristina', 'Van den Steen, Philippe E', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Aguilera-Montilla N', 'Bailon E', 'Uceda-Castro R', 'Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Santos A', 'Gutierrez-Gonzalez A', 'Perez-Sanchez C', 'Van den Steen PE', 'Opdenakker G', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain. agarciapardo@cib.csic.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190213,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0744-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0744-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Jun;38(23):4605-4619. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0744-3.

This single-group, multicenter phase 2 study assessed the safety and efficacy of pracinostat combined with azacitidine in patients who were at least 65 years old with newly diagnosed AML and who were ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy. Patients received pracinostat 60 mg/d, 3 d/wk, for 3 consecutive weeks, plus azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) daily for 7 days in a 28-day cycle. Primary endpoints were complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) rates of the combination. Secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of the regimen. Fifty patients (33 de novo, 12 secondary, and 5 therapy-related AML) were enrolled. Twenty-six patients (52%) achieved the primary endpoint of CR (42%), CRi (4%), and MLFS (6%). Median OS and PFS were 19.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10-26.5 months) and 12.6 months (95% CI, 10-17.7 months), respectively, with a 1-year OS rate of 62%. Forty-three patients (86%) experienced at least 1 grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse event with the combination, with infections (52%), thrombocytopenia (46%), and febrile neutropenia (44%) reported as the most common toxicities. The 30- and 60-day all-cause mortality rates were 2% and 10%, respectively. DNA sequencing revealed somatic mutations at baseline, and clearance rates correlated with response to treatment. Pracinostat plus azacitidine is a well-tolerated and active regimen in the frontline treatment of older patients with AML unfit for intensive therapy. A larger controlled trial is ongoing.

Depending on the number and combinations of lesions, one or more sub-clones expand/s after a variable latency period. Initial stages may develop early in life or later in adulthood and include premalignant (indolent) stages and the malignant phase, defined by an acute leukemia. We recently proposed a cancer model in which the earliest somatic lesions are often age-related early mutations detectable in apparently healthy individuals and where additional oncogenic mutations will lead to the development of an overt neoplasm that is usually a preleukemic condition such as a myelodysplastic syndrome. These neoplasms may or may not transform to overt acute leukemia over time. Thus, depending on the type and number of somatic mutations, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) can be divided into CH with indeterminate potential (CHIP) and CH with oncogenic potential (CHOP). Whereas CHIP mutations per se usually create the molecular background of a neoplastic process, CHOP mutations are disease-related or even disease-specific lesions that trigger differentiation and/or proliferation of neoplastic cells. Over time, the acquisition of additional oncogenic events converts preleukemic neoplasms into secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). In the present article, recent developments in the field are discussed with a focus on CHOP mutations that lead to distinct myeloid neoplasms, their role in disease evolution, and the impact of additional lesions that can drive a preleukemic neoplasm into sAML.","['Valent, Peter', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Milosevic Feenstra, Jelena D', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Arock, Michel', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Horny, Hans-Peter']","['Valent P', 'Kern W', 'Hoermann G', 'Milosevic Feenstra JD', 'Sotlar K', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Germing U', 'Sperr WR', 'Reiter A', 'Wolf D', 'Arock M', 'Haferlach T', 'Horny HP']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, 81377 Munich, Germany. wolfgang.kern@mll.com.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. gregor.hoermann@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Central Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria. gregor.hoermann@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. gregor.hoermann@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.

One of the promising methods of immunotherapy is the activation of immune response by the targeting of negative control checkpoints. The two best-known inhibitory immune checkpoints are cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death protein 1 receptor (PD-1). In AML, PD-1 expression is observed in T-cell subpopulations, including T regulatory lymphocytes. Increased PD-1 expression on CD8+ T lymphocytes may be one of the factors leading to dysfunction of cytotoxic T cells and inhibition of the immune response during the progressive course of AML. Upregulation of checkpoint molecules was observed after alloHSCT and therapy with hypomethylating agents, pointing to a potential clinical application in these settings. Encouraging results from recent clinical trials (a response rate above 50% in a relapsed setting) justify further clinical use. The most common clinical trials employ two PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and two anti-PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) monoclonal antibodies (atezolizumab and durvalumab). Several other inhibitors are under development or in early phases of clinical trials. The results of these clinical trials are awaited with great interest in, as they may allow for the established use of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of AML.","['Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']",['Giannopoulos K'],"['Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. krzysztof.giannopoulos@gmail.com.', ""Department of Hematology, St John's Cancer Centre, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. krzysztof.giannopoulos@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190212,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,PMC6406869,,2019/02/15 06:00,2019/02/15 06:01,['2019/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/15 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm8020236 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm8020236 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2019 Feb 12;8(2). pii: jcm8020236. doi: 10.3390/jcm8020236.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'programmed cell death protein 1 receptor/ programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1)', 'signaling']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xenotransplantation of CBX7-overexpressing HSPCs resulted in increased multi-lineage long-term engraftment and myelopoiesis. Gene expression and chromatin analyses revealed perturbations in genes involved in differentiation, DNA and chromatin maintenance, and cell cycle control. CBX7 is upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and its genetic or pharmacological repression in AML cells inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed several non-histone protein interactions between CBX7 and the H3K9 methyltransferases SETDB1, EHMT1, and EHMT2. These CBX7-binding proteins possess a trimethylated lysine peptide motif highly similar to the canonical CBX7 target H3K27me3. Depletion of SETDB1 in AML cells phenocopied repression of CBX7. We identify CBX7 as an important regulator of self-renewal and uncover non-canonical crosstalk between distinct pathways, revealing therapeutic opportunities for leukemia.","['Jung, Johannes', 'Buisman, Sonja C', 'Weersing, Ellen', 'Dethmers-Ausema, Albertina', 'Zwart, Erik', 'Schepers, Hein', 'Dekker, Mike R', 'Lazare, Seka S', 'Hammerl, Franziska', 'Skokova, Yulia', 'Kooistra, Susanne M', 'Klauke, Karin', 'Poot, Raymond A', 'Bystrykh, Leonid V', 'de Haan, Gerald']","['Jung J', 'Buisman SC', 'Weersing E', 'Dethmers-Ausema A', 'Zwart E', 'Schepers H', 'Dekker MR', 'Lazare SS', 'Hammerl F', 'Skokova Y', 'Kooistra SM', 'Klauke K', 'Poot RA', 'Bystrykh LV', 'de Haan G']","['European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell Biology, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'University Hospital of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell Biology, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.

Methylation of H3K79, which resides on the structured disk face of the nucleosome, is mediated by the Dot1L methyltransferase. Dot1L activity is part of a trans-histone crosstalk pathway, requiring prior histone H2B ubiquitylation of lysine 120 (H2BK120ub) for optimal activity. However, the molecular details describing both how Dot1L binds to the nucleosome and why Dot1L is activated by H2BK120 ubiquitylation are unknown. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Dot1L bound to a nucleosome reconstituted with site-specifically ubiquitylated H2BK120. The structure reveals that Dot1L engages the nucleosome acidic patch using a variant arginine anchor and occupies a conformation poised for methylation. In this conformation, Dot1L and ubiquitin interact directly through complementary hydrophobic surfaces. This study establishes a path to better understand Dot1L function in normal and leukemia cells.","['Anderson, Cathy J', 'Baird, Matthew R', 'Hsu, Allen', 'Barbour, Emily H', 'Koyama, Yuka', 'Borgnia, Mario J', 'McGinty, Robert K']","['Anderson CJ', 'Baird MR', 'Hsu A', 'Barbour EH', 'Koyama Y', 'Borgnia MJ', 'McGinty RK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, School of Medicine, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Genome Integrity and Structural Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.', 'Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Genome Integrity and Structural Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.', 'Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.

We report 15 cases with t(8;16)(p11.2;p13.3). All patients were adult and had AML: 13 women and 2 men, with a median age of 50 years. Ten patients had a history of malignancy and received cytotoxic therapies before therapy-related AML (t-AML), and five patients had de novo AML. All cases of AML showed monoblastic (n = 12) or myelomonocytic (n = 3) differentiation. Hemophagocytosis was observed in seven patients. All patients had t(8;16) in the stemline: seven had t(8;16) as the sole abnormality, two had one additional abnormality, and six had a complex karyotype. KAT6A/CREBBP rearrangement was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 13 patients who had material available for analysis. All patients received induction chemotherapy, and 11 achieved complete remission after first induction. At the time of last follow-up, nine patients (eight t-AML and one de novo AML) died and six were alive, with a median overall survival of 18.2 months. The patients with de novo AML and/or patients with non-complex karyotype showed an ""undefined"" overall survival. We conclude that t(8;16)(p11.2;p13.3) commonly exhibits monoblastic or myelomonocytic differentiation and commonly arises in patients with a history of cancer treated with cytotoxic therapies.

METHODS: Patient-level data from the Phase 3 blinatumomab trial TOWER and published aggregated data from the Phase 3 InO trial INO-VATE-ALL were used to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. Patients with 2+ prior salvage therapies from TOWER were excluded because such patients were not included in INO-VATE-ALL. To ensure balance in the remaining patients, baseline characteristics for the TOWER patients were weighted to match the average baseline characteristics in INO-VATE-ALL, including sex, age, race, performance status, bone marrow blast, previous salvage therapy, previous allogeneic transplantation, complete remission with complete hematologic recovery (CR) to most recent induction therapy, and duration of first remission. Overall survival (OS), including median and restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 12 and 20.7 months, and CR were estimated and compared. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients in TOWER were included (blinatumomab, n = 203; standard of care chemotherapy, n = 107). After matching the listed baseline characteristics, the median OS was 9.3 months for blinatumomab and 7.7 months for InO (weighted log-rank test p = 0.4). The relative RMST at 12 months was 1.6 months longer for blinatumomab than for InO [95% CI (0.1, 3.2); p = 0.04]; at 20.7 months the RMST was not significantly different. The CR rates were similar [anchor-based difference = - 2.8%, 95% CI (- 17.5%, 11.9%); p = 0.71]. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for cross-trial differences, blinatumomab demonstrated a similar CR rate and potential OS benefit versus InO among adult patients with R/R ALL who received no more than one prior salvage therapy. Further studies are suggested to confirm this finding.

We analyzed 392 patients with CBF-AML [281 with t(8;21), 111 with inv.(16)/t(16;16)] among data from 3041 patients with AML from the Korean AML Registry. Interestingly, del(9q) was less frequently detected in Korean than in German patients with t(8;21) (7.5% vs. 17%), and del(7q) was more frequently detected in Korean patients with inv(16). Overall survival (OS) was similar between patients in the first complete remission (CR) who received allogeneic (alloSCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for CBF-AML. OS of t(8;21) patients was poor when undergoing alloSCT in second/third CR, while OS of inv(16) patients in second/third CR was similar to that in first CR. Patients with > 3-log reduction of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 qPCR had improved 3-year event-free survival (EFS) than those without (73.2% vs. 50.3%). Patients with t(8;21) AML with D816 mutation of the c-Kit gene showed inferior EFS and OS. These poor outcomes might be overcome by alloSCT.

Infections are also a common complication of ALL therapy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is used experimentally to mimic infection-related systemic effects. To our knowledge, the contribution of systemic infections to the risk of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis has not been investigated. PROCEDURE: Patients with ALL on St. Jude Total Therapy XV (n = 365) were assessed for documented bacteremia prior to development of osteonecrosis, which was confirmed by MRI, and graded using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology for Adverse Events (version 3.0). In a preclinical model, Balb/cJ mice treated with dexamethasone plus or minus LPS were assessed for frequency and severity of osteonecrosis and arteriopathy. RESULTS: We found that patients with ALL who experienced bacteremia had a higher frequency of symptomatic osteonecrosis (>/=grade 2) than those who did not (OR: 1.88; 95% CI, 1.03-3.41, P = 0.038). LPS exacerbated experimental dexamethasone-induced osteonecrosis. Mice treated with dexamethasone plus LPS had a higher incidence of osteonecrosis (P = 0.00086) and arteriopathy (P = 0.0047) than did those treated with dexamethasone alone, and the severity of osteonecrosis (P = 0.00045) and arteriopathy (P = 0.0048) was also more pronounced with the addition of LPS treatment. The increase in osteonecrosis was not explained by any alteration of dexamethasone pharmacokinetics by LPS. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify systemic infection during ALL therapy as a novel risk factor in the development of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.","['Finch, Emily R', 'Janke, Laura J', 'Smith, Colton A', 'Karol, Seth E', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Wolf, Joshua', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Finch ER', 'Janke LJ', 'Smith CA', 'Karol SE', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Kaste SC', 'Inaba H', 'Pui CH', 'Wolf J', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Veterinary Pathology Core, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190213,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC6472979,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27669 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27669. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27669.

This study seeks to understand caregiver experiences of survivor's school-related challenges. This understudied area is critical given the 85% survivor rate for those diagnosed with childhood cancer and the disproportionate risk of learning difficulties faced by those with brain tumor or who receive therapy that targets the central nervous system. METHODS: Affected caregivers participated in open-ended interviews addressing school experiences during survivorship. Following preliminary analysis using a grounded theory approach, interviewees and other stakeholders from education, medical, and foundation communities participated in focus groups. Member-check activities explored the validity of identified themes and a model derived from interview data describing schooling challenges during survivorship. RESULTS: Caregivers reported schooling-related experiences were often stressful and such stressors recurred during survivors' ongoing education. They reported a lack of appropriate knowledge among themselves, school staff, and clinicians about issues their survivor faced as well as concerns about communication and uncertainties about the processes required to attain appropriate services. These themes of knowledge, communication, and process issues were embedded within family approaches to coping with difficulties as well as the specific types of late effects each survivor faced. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model and clinical implications provide a foundation for future research and intervention development. Such work is needed to more effectively support survivors and their caregivers with difficulties that arise during schooling following treatment for childhood cancer.","['Pare-Blagoev, E Juliana', 'Ruble, Kathy', 'Bryant, Camille', 'Jacobson, Lisa']","['Pare-Blagoev EJ', 'Ruble K', 'Bryant C', 'Jacobson L']","['School of Education, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Life Clinic and Leukemia Survivorship Program, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'School of Education, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Clinical Neuropsychologist, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190307,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,,2019/02/14 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.5026 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2019 Apr;28(4):847-853. doi: 10.1002/pon.5026.

This study evaluated outcomes of patients with B-cell precursor ALL with MRD of >/=10(-4) Methods: Study population was from ALL study groups in Europe managed in national study protocols 2000-2014. MRD was measured by polymerase chain reaction or flow cytometry. Patients were age >/=15 years at initial ALL diagnosis. Patients were excluded if exposed to blinatumomab within 18 months of baseline or prior alloHSCT. RESULTS: Of 272 patients in CR1, baseline MRD was >/=10(-1), 10(-2) to <10(-1), 10(-3) to <10(-2), and 10(-4) to <10(-3) in 15 (6%), 71 (26%), 109 (40%), and 77 (28%) patients, respectively. Median duration of complete remission (DoR) was 18.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-27.2), median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 12.4 months (95% CI, 10.0-19.0) and median overall survival (OS) was 32.5 months (95% CI, 23.6-48.0). Lower baseline MRD level (P </= .0003) and white blood cell count <30,000/microL at diagnosis (P </= .0053) were strong predictors for better RFS and DoR. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) was associated with longer RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.84) and DoR (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.64); the association with OS was not significant (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.05). DISCUSSION: In conclusion, RFS, DoR, and OS are relatively short in patients with MRD-positive ALL, particularly at higher MRD levels. AlloHSCT may improve survival but has limitations. Alternative approaches are needed to improve outcomes in MRD-positive ALL.","['Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Foa, Robin', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Kim, Christopher', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Parovichnikova, Elena', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Schoonen, Marieke', 'Stieglmaier, Julia M', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard', 'Bassan, Renato']","['Gokbuget N', 'Dombret H', 'Giebel S', 'Bruggemann M', 'Doubek M', 'Foa R', 'Hoelzer D', 'Kim C', 'Martinelli G', 'Parovichnikova E', 'Rambaldi A', 'Ribera JM', 'Schoonen M', 'Stieglmaier JM', 'Zugmaier G', 'Bassan R']","['a Department of Medicine II, Department of Hematology/Oncology , University Hospital , Frankfurt , Germany.', 'b Hopital Saint-Louis, University Paris Diderot , Paris , France.', 'c Maria Sklodowska Curie Memorial Cancer Center , Gliwice , Poland.', 'd Department of Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel , Kiel , Germany.', 'e Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology , University Hospital , Brno , Czech Republic.', 'f ""Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Medicine II, Department of Hematology/Oncology , University Hospital , Frankfurt , Germany.', 'g Amgen Inc , Thousand Oaks , CA , USA.', 'h Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS , Meldola , Italy.', 'i National Research Center for Hematology , Moscow , Russia.', 'j Dipartimento di Oncologia ed Ematologia , Universita degli Studi di Milano and Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII , Bergamo , Italy.', 'k ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute , Barcelona , Spain.', 'l Amgen Ltd , London , UK.', 'm Amgen GmBH , Munich , Germany.', 'm Amgen GmBH , Munich , Germany.', ""n Ospedale dell'Angelo , Mestre-Venezia , Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1567654 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):337-348. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1567654.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'MRD', 'allogeneic stem cell transplant', 'minimal residual disease']",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1269-6282', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6177-3566', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1042-6024']",,,20190228,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous study, we found that Tet2 knockout mice progressively developed lymphocytic leukemia and myeloid leukemia with aging. Howeverthe role of Tet2 in bone marrow microenvironment is unclear. Here in this study, we found that more Tet2-/- mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow were in the G2/M cell cycle stages. The division time of Tet2-/- MSCs was shorter than that of the control cells. The growth rate of Tet2-/- MSCs was accelerated. The cobblestone area-forming cells assay (CAFC) showed that Tet2 knockout MSCs supported the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the differentiation of HSCs was skewed towards myeloid cells. Through the dot blotting experiment, we found that the total methylation level was increased in Tet2-/- bone marrow cells (BM). We used the methylation-chip to analyze the methylation level of Tet2-/- bone marrow cells and found that the level of methylation was increased in the transcriptional starting area (TSS), exons (EXONS) and 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). Moreover, we found that the cytokines secreted by Tet2-/- MSCs, such as IL-8 and IL-18, were decreased. While the expressions of GM-CSF and CCL-3, which supported hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate to myeloid cells, were increased in Tet2-/- MSCs. Our results demonstrated that Tet2 regulates MSCs to support hematopoiesis.","['Gu, Jie', 'Wang, Yuxia', 'Gao, Juan', 'Yuan, Shengnan', 'Chu, Yajing', 'Li, Yanhan', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Wang, Xiaomin']","['Gu J', 'Wang Y', 'Gao J', 'Yuan S', 'Chu Y', 'Li Y', 'Yuan W', 'Wang X']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,9426463,,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.13345/j.cjb.180113 [doi]'],ppublish,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao. 2019 Jan 25;35(1):142-149. doi: 10.13345/j.cjb.180113.,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'epigenetic regulation', 'member 2 of the Tet family', 'mesenchymal stem cells']",,,,,,20190611,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dioxygenases', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) regimen is considered the treatment of choice for young fit patients with CLL; however, this combination is toxic for older patients. At the time this study was first planned and initiated, there was no standard chemo-immunotherapy regimen regarded as standard therapy for the less fit elderly patient with CLL. Here, we conducted a single-arm, phase II trial to examine the efficacy and safety of lower-dose fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combined with a standard dose of rituximab (LD-FCR) in elderly patients with previously untreated CLL. Forty patients received LD-FCR and were included in the efficacy analysis. Two patients treated with FC alone were only included in the safety analysis. The median age was 72.7 years (range, 65.0 to 85.0). The overall response and complete response rates were 67.5% and 42.5%, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 35.5 months (95% CI, 29.27-41.67). Two patients (4.8%) died during the study period. Hematological toxicities and infections were the most common complications encountered; grade 3 to 4 treatment-related neutropenia occurred in 20 (47.6%) patients. During the entire study follow-up, 26 patients (61.9%) had all grades of infection including six (14.3%) with neutropenic fever and eight (19%) with grade 3 to 4 non-neutropenic infections. In conclusion, LD-FCR is an effective and relatively safe regimen for previously untreated patients with CLL. It has the advantage of being both ""time and cost limited"" and, even in the era of novel agents, can still be considered when planning treatment for elderly patients without high-risk biomarkers. However, recent results in fit elderly patients using the combination of bendamustine and rituximab which have achieved longer PFS with good safety profile must be taken into consideration in this regard.","['Herishanu, Yair', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Braester, Andrei', 'Bairey, Osnat', 'Aviv, Ariel', 'Rahimi-Levene, Naomi', 'Fineman, Riva', 'Levi, Itai', 'Yuklea, Mona', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Polliack, Aaron']","['Herishanu Y', 'Tadmor T', 'Braester A', 'Bairey O', 'Aviv A', 'Rahimi-Levene N', 'Fineman R', 'Levi I', 'Yuklea M', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Shvidel L', 'Polliack A']","['Department of Hematology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Galilee Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine in Galilee, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Assaf Harofe Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Soroka Medical Center, Beer Sheba and Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheba, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital and Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190312,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2580 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Apr;37(2):185-192. doi: 10.1002/hon.2580.

She previously had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and had finished chemotherapy one year prior to presentation. She was receiving monthly intravenous immunoglobulins for bronchiectasis. Brain imaging showed hypodensity in the left temporo-parietal regions. Cerebrospinal fluid was positive for the JC virus, leading to a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML). She remains alive, eight months following initial presentation. The case was valuable for reflective practice in avoiding diagnostic (confirmation) bias because the treating team pursued an incorrect diagnosis of stroke and secondary seizure after radiology findings appeared consistent with this. Additionally, PML has not previously been reported in individuals with CLL receiving immunoglobulin therapy, and may explain the relatively benign course in this individual patient. This offers a potential research question for disease modifying treatments in PML. LEARNING POINTS: This case highlights new insights into an uncommon but important condition: always consider progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy when immunocompromised patients present with neurological symptoms.A full differential diagnosis should always be considered, even in the context of a more 'plausible' diagnosis.Avoid premature closure and confirmation bias as cognitive errors in diagnostic reasoning.","['Dani, Melanie', 'Bowen-Carpenter, Sophie', 'McGown, Patrick J']","['Dani M', 'Bowen-Carpenter S', 'McGown PJ']","['West Middlesex University Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'West Middlesex University Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'West Middlesex University Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190108,Italy,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,European journal of case reports in internal medicine,101648453,PMC6372046,"['Conflicts of Interests: The Authors declare that there are no competing', 'interests.']",2019/02/14 06:00,2019/02/14 06:01,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12890/2019_001006 [doi]', '1006-1-6815-1-10-20190108 [pii]']",epublish,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med. 2019 Jan 8;6(1):001006. doi: 10.12890/2019_001006. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'immunocompromised', 'progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells with IDH mutations reduce alphakg to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), an oncometabolite, and 2HG directly transforms normal cells to malignant cells through histone demethylation and epigenetic dysregulation. However, whether IDH mutations affect cancer stromal cells is elusive, and little is known whether 2HG may impact the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that the IDH mutant cancer secretome and metabolites would stimulate primitive vascular-endothelial genesis. The secretome of IDH1 mutant human fibrosarcoma cells was harvested following medium starvation and was used to treat vascular-endothelial cells using a tube formation assay. GSK864, an allosteric IDH1 inhibitor, was supplemented to the fibrosarcoma secretome to determine its effects on vascular-endothelial tube formation. Exogenous 2HG or as supplemented in the GSK864-treated secretome was applied to further induce vascular-endothelial perturbation. Total vascular-endothelial tube lengths were quantified using NIH/Image J. Two-sided Student's t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis. The IDH1 mutant fibrosarcoma secretome stimulated vascular-endothelial tube formation by ~138% relative to control. Remarkably, GSK864 attenuated vascular-endothelial tube formation by ~36%, but 2HG not only reversed GSK864 attenuation of tube formation, but also significantly stimulated vascular-endothelial tubes in the GSK864-treated fibrosarcoma secretome. Importantly, 2HG alone augmented vascular-endothelial tube formation that was equivalent to the fibrosarcoma secretome. Thus, 2HG stimulates vascular-endothelial genesis in conjunction with the fibrosarcoma secretome, despite pre-emptive inhibition of IDH1 mutation with GSK864, suggesting that 2HG enables oncogenic angiogenesis via paracrine signaling. Stimulation of vascular-endothelial genesis by 2HG alone, independent of the cancer secretome, suggests that 2HG also activates oncogenic angiogenic pathways in cancer stromal cells. Thus, the IDH mutant cancer secretome stimulates primitive oncogenic angiogenesis through 2HG and/or paracrine pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest novel mechanisms by which the IDH mutant cancer secretome and/or metabolite, specifically 2HG, interacts with the tumor microenvironment by inducing oncogenic angiogenesis in favor of metastasis.","['Mao, Maiya J', 'Leonardi, Donna E']","['Mao MJ', 'Leonardi DE']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Bergen County Academies 200 Hackensack Ave, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cell Biology, Bergen County Academies 200 Hackensack Ave, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190101,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,PMC6356916,['None.'],2019/02/14 06:00,2019/02/14 06:01,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/14 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2019 Jan 1;9(1):122-133. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['2-hydroxyglutarate', '2HG', 'IDH', 'angiogenesis', 'glioma', 'histone demethylation', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'leukemia', 'sarcoma', 'tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMO-conjugation of PML is a regulatory step for PML nuclear body (PML-NB) formation, and HIPK2 is SUMO-conjugated and recruited into the PML-NBs. Although HIPK2 mutations (R861W and N951I) were found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which HIPK2 mutations are associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia. Here we show that HIPK2 mutants found in AML and MDS patients are defective in SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) function. Due to defective SIM function, the HIPK2 mutants were not modified with SUMO-1, and not recruited to the PML-NBs. However, the HIPK2 mutants can normally bind to and phosphorylate AML1b. Therefore, the HIPK2 mutants can sequestrate the AML1 complex out of the PML-NBs, resulting in the disruption of AML1-mediated activation of target genes for myeloid differentiation. In addition, the differentiation of K562 blast cells was impaired by the expression of the HIPK2 SIM-defective mutants. These results suggest that HIPK2 targeting into the PML-NBs via the SIMs is crucial for HIPK2-mediated induction of myeloid differentiation, and is associated with AML pathogenesis.","['Sung, Ki Sa', 'Kim, Sun-Jick', 'Cho, Sang Woo', 'Park, Ye-Jin', 'Tae, Kun', 'Choi, Cheol Yong']","['Sung KS', 'Kim SJ', 'Cho SW', 'Park YJ', 'Tae K', 'Choi CY']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York, New York 10029, United States.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190101,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,PMC6356924,['None.'],2019/02/14 06:00,2019/02/14 06:01,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/14 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2019 Jan 1;9(1):94-107. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['HIPK2', 'PML-NBs', 'SUMO-interacting motif', 'SUMOylation', 'myeloid differentiation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD7 is highly expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but it is not expressed in one small group of normal T lymphocytes. Here, we constructed monovalent CD7-CAR-NK-92MI and bivalent dCD7-CAR-NK-92MI cells using the CD7 nanobody VHH6 sequences from our laboratory. Both CD7-CAR-NK-92MI and dCD7-CAR-NK-92MI cells consistently showed specific and potent anti-tumor activity against T-cell leukemia cell lines and primary tumor cells. We observed robust cytotoxicity of the bivalent mdCD7-CAR-NK-92MI monoclonal cells against primary T-ALL samples. In agreement with the enhanced cytotoxicity of mdCD7-CAR-NK-92MI cells, significant elevations in the secretion of Granzyme B and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) were also found in mdCD7-CAR-NK-92MI cells in response to CD7-positive primary T-ALL cells compared with NK-92MI-mock cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that mdCD7-CAR-NK-92MI cells significantly inhibited disease progression in xenograft mouse models of T-ALL primary tumor cells. Our data suggest that CD7-CAR-NK-92MI cells can be used as a new method or a complementary therapy for treating T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['You, Fengtao', 'Wang, Yinyan', 'Jiang, Licui', 'Zhu, Xuejun', 'Chen, Dan', 'Yuan, Lei', 'An, Gangli', 'Meng, Huimin', 'Yang, Lin']","['You F', 'Wang Y', 'Jiang L', 'Zhu X', 'Chen D', 'Yuan L', 'An G', 'Meng H', 'Yang L']","['The Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University Suzhou, Jiangsu, P.

We have shown that PC generation can be modeled using multi-step culture systems that reproduce the sequential cell differentiation occurring in vivo. Using this unique model, we investigated the role of EZH2 during PC differentiation (PCD) using H3K27me3 and EZH2 ChIP-binding profiles. We then studied the effect of the inhibition of EZH2 enzymatic activity to understand how EZH2 regulates the key functions involved in PCD. EZH2 expression significantly increases in preplasmablasts with H3K27me3 mediated repression of genes involved in B cell and plasma cell identity. EZH2 was also found to be recruited to H3K27me3-free promoters of transcriptionally active genes known to regulate cell proliferation. Inhibition the catalytic activity of EZH2 resulted in B to PC transcriptional changes associated with PC maturation induction, as well as higher immunoglobulin secretion. Altogether, our data suggest that EZH2 is involved in the maintenance of preplasmablast transitory immature proliferative state that supports their amplification.","['Herviou, Laurie', 'Jourdan, Michel', 'Martinez, Anne-Marie', 'Cavalli, Giacomo', 'Moreaux, Jerome']","['Herviou L', 'Jourdan M', 'Martinez AM', 'Cavalli G', 'Moreaux J']","['IGH, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IGH, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IGH, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IGH, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IGH, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France. jerome.moreaux@igh.cnrs.fr.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, CHU de Montpellier, Montpellier, France. jerome.moreaux@igh.cnrs.fr.', 'UFR de Medecine, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France. jerome.moreaux@igh.cnrs.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190212,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6756037,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0392-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0392-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):2047-2060. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0392-1.

Oncogenic fusions of FGFR1 with various fusion partners were described in myeloid proliferative neoplasms, and overexpression and mutations of FGFR3 are common in multiple myeloma. In addition, fibroblast growth factors are abundant in the bone marrow, and they were shown to enhance the survival of acute myeloid leukemia cells. Here we investigate the effect of FGFR stimulation on pediatric BCP-ALL cells in vitro, and search for mutations with deep targeted next-generation sequencing of mutational hotspots in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. In 481 primary BCP-ALL cases, 28 samples from 19 unique relapsed BCP-ALL cases, and twelve BCP-ALL cell lines we found that mutations are rare (4/481 = 0.8%, 0/28 and 0/12) and do not affect codons which are frequently mutated in other malignancies. However, recombinant ligand FGF2 reduced the response to prednisolone in several BCP-ALL cell lines in vitro. We therefore conclude that FGFR signaling can contribute to prednisolone resistance in BCP-ALL cells, but that activating mutations in this receptor tyrosine kinase family are very rare.","['Jerchel, Isabel S', 'Hoogkamer, Alex Q', 'Aries, Ingrid M', 'Boer, Judith M', 'Besselink, Nicolle J M', 'Koudijs, Marco J', 'Pieters, Rob', 'den Boer, Monique L']","['Jerchel IS', 'Hoogkamer AQ', 'Aries IM', 'Boer JM', 'Besselink NJM', 'Koudijs MJ', 'Pieters R', 'den Boer ML']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Division Biomedical Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Division Biomedical Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. m.l.denboer@prinsesmaximacentrum.nl."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands. m.l.denboer@prinsesmaximacentrum.nl.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584, CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands. m.l.denboer@prinsesmaximacentrum.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190212,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6372586,,2019/02/14 06:00,2020/09/24 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-38169-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-38169-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Feb 12;9(1):1875. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-38169-z.,,,,,,,,20200923,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ligands', 'Mutation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']","['0 (Ligands)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunological shifts that occur in pregnancy can partially be explained by alterations in hormonal levels. Furthermore, during pregnancy, many autoimmune diseases go into remission, only to flare again in the early postpartum period. Given these important changes in the clinical course of a number of autoimmune disorders, surprisingly little has been done to investigate the inflammatory profile changes across pregnancy and the postpartum period. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe how inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers change from late pregnancy to the early postpartum period, using a multiplexed assay consisting of both well-known as well as exploratory proteins. Two-hundred-and-ninety women were included in this study and donated a total of 312 blood samples; 198 in late pregnancy (~gw38) and 114 in the postpartum period (~w8). The plasma blood samples were analyzed for 92 immune system related protein markers using Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I panel, a high-sensitivity assay based on proximity extension assay technology. Fifty-six inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers were significantly different between pregnancy and the postpartum, of which 50 survived corrections for multiple comparisons. Out of these 50 markers, 41 decreased from pregnancy to postpartum, while the remaining 9 increased in the postpartum period. The top five markers with the greatest decrease in the postpartum period were Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R), Latency-associated peptide Transforming growth factor beta-1 (LAP TGF-beta-1), C-C motif chemokine 28 (CCL28), Oncostatin M (OSM) and Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Top three markers that increased in the postpartum period were Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11 (TRANCE), Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12 (TWEAK), and C-C motif chemokine/Eotaxin (CCL11). This study revealed that the majority of the markers decreased from pregnancy to postpartum, and only a few increased. Several of the top proteins that were higher in pregnancy than postpartum have anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory properties promoting pregnancy progress. These results clearly reflect the tremendous change in the immune system in the pregnancy to postpartum transition.","['Brann, Emma', 'Edvinsson, Asa', 'Rostedt Punga, Anna', 'Sundstrom-Poromaa, Inger', 'Skalkidou, Alkistis']","['Brann E', 'Edvinsson A', 'Rostedt Punga A', 'Sundstrom-Poromaa I', 'Skalkidou A']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. asa.edvinsson@kbh.uu.se."", 'Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190212,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6372606,,2019/02/14 06:00,2020/09/24 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-38304-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-38304-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Feb 12;9(1):1863. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-38304-w.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6246-7218', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2178-9413', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2491-2042', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4935-7532']",,,20200923,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Blood Proteins/chemistry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*blood', 'Inflammation Mediators/blood', 'Ligands', 'Placenta', '*Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy/*blood', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prospective Studies']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Ligands)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has long been used for the treatment of chronic-phase CML, but its mechanisms of action against CML stem cells remain unclear. We found that IFN-alpha upregulated CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) in BCR-ABL-expressing mouse cells by activating STAT1 and STAT5, which were recruited to a newly identified 3' distal enhancer of Cebpb that contains tandemly aligned IFN-gamma-activated site elements. Suppression or deletion of the IFN-gamma-activated site elements abrogated IFN-alpha-dependent upregulation of C/EBPbeta. IFN-alpha induced differentiation and exhaustion of CML stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo, in a C/EBPbeta-dependent manner. In addition, IFN-alpha upregulated C/EBPbeta and induced exhaustion of lineage(-) CD34(+) cells from CML patients. Collectively, these results clearly indicate that C/EBPbeta is a critical mediator of IFN-alpha-induced differentiation and exhaustion of CML stem cells.","['Yokota, Asumi', 'Hirai, Hideyo', 'Sato, Ryuichi', 'Adachi, Hiroko', 'Sato, Fumiko', 'Hayashi, Yoshihiro', 'Sato, Atsushi', 'Kamio, Naoka', 'Miura, Yasuo', 'Nakano, Masakazu', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Tashiro, Kei', 'Maekawa, Taira']","['Yokota A', 'Hirai H', 'Sato R', 'Adachi H', 'Sato F', 'Hayashi Y', 'Sato A', 'Kamio N', 'Miura Y', 'Nakano M', 'Tenen DG', 'Kimura S', 'Tashiro K', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Medical Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Medical Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Medical Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Division of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Medical Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Genomic Medical Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6373744,,2019/02/14 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018020503 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018020503 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Feb 12;3(3):476-488. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018020503.,,,"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL131477/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9036-4865', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1490-9923']",,,20200319,IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice']","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CEBPB protein, human)']",,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no functional evidence to demonstrate whether these mutations contribute to tumorigenesis. Similarly, the role of PHF6 in hematopoiesis is unknown. We report here that Phf6 deletion in mice resulted in a reduced number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), an increased number of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and an increased proportion of cycling stem and progenitor cells. Loss of PHF6 caused increased and sustained hematopoietic reconstitution in serial transplantation experiments. Interferon-stimulated gene expression was upregulated in the absence of PHF6 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells and cycling hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were restored to normal by combined loss of PHF6 and the interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1. Ectopic expression of TLX3 alone caused partially penetrant leukemia. TLX3 expression and loss of PHF6 combined caused fully penetrant early-onset leukemia. Our data suggest that PHF6 is a hematopoietic tumor suppressor and is important for fine-tuning hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homeostasis.","['McRae, Helen M', 'Garnham, Alexandra L', 'Hu, Yifang', 'Witkowski, Matthew T', 'Corbett, Mark A', 'Dixon, Mathew P', 'May, Rose E', 'Sheikh, Bilal N', 'Chiang, William', 'Kueh, Andrew J', 'Nguyen, Tan A', 'Man, Kevin', 'Gloury, Renee', 'Aubrey, Brandon J', 'Policheni, Antonia', 'Di Rago, Ladina', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Gray, Daniel H D', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Hawkins, Edwin D', 'Wilcox, Stephen', 'Gecz, Jozef', 'Kallies, Axel', 'McCormack, Matthew P', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Voss, Anne K', 'Thomas, Tim']","['McRae HM', 'Garnham AL', 'Hu Y', 'Witkowski MT', 'Corbett MA', 'Dixon MP', 'May RE', 'Sheikh BN', 'Chiang W', 'Kueh AJ', 'Nguyen TA', 'Man K', 'Gloury R', 'Aubrey BJ', 'Policheni A', 'Di Rago L', 'Alexander WS', 'Gray DHD', 'Strasser A', 'Hawkins ED', 'Wilcox S', 'Gecz J', 'Kallies A', 'McCormack MP', 'Smyth GK', 'Voss AK', 'Thomas T']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Adelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Adelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia;

We evaluated exosomes from serum of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as an antigenic source for dendritic cells (DC) and the effects upon antitumor cytotoxicity, assessed by the percentage of specific lysis of K562 leukemic cells in co-cultures. Surprisingly, incubation of exosomes with DCs decreased lysis of K562, which may correspond to a mechanism of tumor evasion in vivo. However, when immature DCs were pulsed with exosomes purified from K562 culture supernatants, the lysis of target cells was notably enhanced, associated with a substantial increase in the expression of the maturation marker CD83. Thus, the development of vaccines using patients' exosomes would probably add no benefits to the treatment of AML; alternately, exosomes from cultured cells may represent an effective way for maturing DCs into a cytotoxic phenotype, without the immunosuppression observed with patients' exosomes.","['Benites, Bruno Deltreggia', 'da Silva Santos Duarte, Adriana', 'Longhini, Ana Leda Figueiredo', 'Santos, Irene', 'Alvarez, Marisa Claudia', 'de Morais Ribeiro, Ligia Nunes', 'Paula, Eneida de', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla']","['Benites BD', 'da Silva Santos Duarte A', 'Longhini ALF', 'Santos I', 'Alvarez MC', 'de Morais Ribeiro LN', 'Paula E', 'Saad STO']","['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.

Internal exposure to radon accounts for about half of the natural background radiation dose to which humans are exposed annually. Radon is a carcinogen and is the second leading cause of lung cancer following smoking. An association between radon and lung cancer has been consistently reported in epidemiological studies on mine workers and the general population with indoor radon exposure. However, associations have not been clearly established between radon and other diseases, such as leukemia and thyroid cancer. Radiation doses are assessed by applying specific dose conversion coefficients according to the source (e.g., radon or thoron) and form of exposure (e.g., internal or external). However, regardless of the source or form of exposure, the effects of a given estimated dose on human health are identical, assuming that individuals have the same sensitivity to radiation. Recently, radiation exceeding the annual dose limit of the general population (1 mSv/yr) was detected in bed mattresses produced by D company due to the use of a monazite-based anion powder containing uranium and thorium. This has sparked concerns about the health hazards for mattress users caused by radiation exposure. In light of this event, this study presents scientific information about the assessment of radon and thoron exposure and its human implications for human health, which have emerged as a recent topic of interest and debate in society.","['Seo, Songwon', 'Ha, Wi-Ho', 'Kang, Jin-Kyu', 'Lee, Dalnim', 'Park, Soojin', 'Kwon, Tae-Eun', 'Jin, Young Woo']","['Seo S', 'Ha WH', 'Kang JK', 'Lee D', 'Park S', 'Kwon TE', 'Jin YW']","['National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190212,Korea (South),Epidemiol Health,Epidemiology and health,101519472,PMC6446066,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/04/05 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['epih.e2019004 [pii]', '10.4178/epih.e2019004 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Health. 2019;41:e2019004. doi: 10.4178/epih.e2019004.

Cells were treated with different concentrations of fluoxetine for different times. MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assays were used for testing the effects of fluoxetine on cell viability. The regulation of apoptosis signaling, and anti-apoptotic, proliferation, and metastasis-associated proteins after fluoxetine treatment were assayed by flow cytometry and Western blotting assay. The detection of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) activation after fluoxetine treatment was performed by NF-kappaB reporter gene assay. The results demonstrated that fluoxetine significantly reduced cell viability, cell migration/invasion, NF-kappaB, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation, and expression of anti-apoptotic (Cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein (C-FLIP), Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XAIP), and Survivin), proliferation (Cyclin-D1), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), and metastasis-associated proteins (matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)). Fluoxetine also significantly induced apoptosis, unregulated extrinsic (activation of first apoptosis signal protein and ligand (Fas/FasL), and caspase-8) and intrinsic (loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) pathways and increased Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (BAK) apoptosis signaling. Taken together, these results demonstrated that fluoxetine induced apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and diminished ERK/NF-kappaB-modulated anti-apoptotic and invasive potential in HCC cells in vitro.","['Chen, Wei-Ting', 'Hsu, Fei-Ting', 'Liu, Yu-Chang', 'Chen, Cheng-Hsien', 'Hsu, Li-Cho', 'Lin, Song-Shei']","['Chen WT', 'Hsu FT', 'Liu YC', 'Chen CH', 'Hsu LC', 'Lin SS']","['Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung 406, Taiwan. wt820368@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan. wt820368@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Department of Physical Therapy, Shu-Zen Junior College of Medicine and Management, Kaohsiung 821, Taiwan. wt820368@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan. sakiro920@mail.cmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung 406, Taiwan. kevinyc.liu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua 505, Taiwan. kevinyc.liu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua 500, Taiwan. kevinyc.liu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Surgery, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua 500, Taiwan. picorna@gmail.com.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University Hospital, Yilan 260, Taiwan. hsulc@ymuh.ym.edu.tw.', 'Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung 406, Taiwan. sslin@ctust.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190211,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6386946,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/05/30 06:00,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20030757 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20030757 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Feb 11;20(3). pii: ijms20030757. doi: 10.3390/ijms20030757.,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB', 'apoptosis', 'fluoxetine', 'human hepatocellular carcinoma']","['ZBH107-21/Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital', 'RD107069/Changhua Show Chwan Memorial Hospital', 'CTU107-P-105/Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8681-4472'],,,20190529,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Fluoxetine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '01K63SUP8D (Fluoxetine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major risk factors associated with IA will be described since their recognition constitutes the first step of prevention. The latter is further analyzed into chemoprophylaxis and non-pharmacologic approaches. Triazoles are the mainstay of anti-fungal prophylaxis while the other measures revolve around reducing exposure to mold spores. Three levels of treatment have been identified: (a) empiric, (b) pre-emptive, and (c) targeted treatment. Empiric is initiated in febrile neutropenic patients and uses mainly caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB). Pre-emptive is a diagnostic driven approach attempting to reduce unnecessary use of anti-fungals. Treatment targeted at proven or probable IA is age-dependent, with voriconazole and LAMB being the cornerstones in >2yrs and <2yrs age groups, respectively.","['Papachristou, Savvas', 'Iosifidis, Elias', 'Roilides, Emmanuel']","['Papachristou S', 'Iosifidis E', 'Roilides E']","['Infectious Diseases Unit, 3rd Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University School of Health Sciences, Konstantinoupoleos 49, 54642 Thessaloniki, Greece. savvas.gpap@gmail.com.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, 3rd Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University School of Health Sciences, Konstantinoupoleos 49, 54642 Thessaloniki, Greece. iosifidish@gmail.com.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, 3rd Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University School of Health Sciences, Konstantinoupoleos 49, 54642 Thessaloniki, Greece. roilides@med.auth.gr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190211,Switzerland,J Fungi (Basel),"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",101671827,PMC6463058,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/02/14 06:01,['2019/02/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/14 06:01 [medline]']","['jof5010014 [pii]', '10.3390/jof5010014 [doi]']",epublish,J Fungi (Basel). 2019 Feb 11;5(1). pii: jof5010014. doi: 10.3390/jof5010014.,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus', 'anti-fungal agents', 'hematological malignancies']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9881-451X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0202-364X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using methylome sequencing we identified CpG islands that display partial methylation encroachment across the 5' or 3' CpG island borders. CpG island methylation encroachment is widespread in prostate and breast cancer and commonly associates with gene suppression. We show that the pattern of H3K4me1 at CpG island borders in normal cells predicts the different modes of cancer CpG island hypermethylation. Notably, genetic manipulation of Kmt2d results in concordant alterations in H3K4me1 levels and CpG island border DNA methylation encroachment. Our findings suggest a role for H3K4me1 in the demarcation of CpG island methylation borders in normal cells, which become eroded in cancer.","['Skvortsova, Ksenia', 'Masle-Farquhar, Etienne', 'Luu, Phuc-Loi', 'Song, Jenny Z', 'Qu, Wenjia', 'Zotenko, Elena', 'Gould, Cathryn M', 'Du, Qian', 'Peters, Timothy J', 'Colino-Sanguino, Yolanda', 'Pidsley, Ruth', 'Nair, Shalima S', 'Khoury, Amanda', 'Smith, Grady C', 'Miosge, Lisa A', 'Reed, Joanne H', 'Kench, James G', 'Rubin, Mark A', 'Horvath, Lisa', 'Bogdanovic, Ozren', 'Lim, Sue Mei', 'Polo, Jose M', 'Goodnow, Christopher C', 'Stirzaker, Clare', 'Clark, Susan J']","['Skvortsova K', 'Masle-Farquhar E', 'Luu PL', 'Song JZ', 'Qu W', 'Zotenko E', 'Gould CM', 'Du Q', 'Peters TJ', 'Colino-Sanguino Y', 'Pidsley R', 'Nair SS', 'Khoury A', 'Smith GC', 'Miosge LA', 'Reed JH', 'Kench JG', 'Rubin MA', 'Horvath L', 'Bogdanovic O', 'Lim SM', 'Polo JM', 'Goodnow CC', 'Stirzaker C', 'Clark SJ']","['Epigenetics Research Laboratory, Genomics and Epigenetics Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, 384 Victoria St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia;

We provide a comprehensive evaluation of subsequent hospitalization in five-year survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: In the Adult Life after Childhood Cancer in Scandinavia Study, we identified 4003 five-year survivors diagnosed with childhood leukemia 1970-2008 in Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and Finland. Survivors and 129 828 population comparisons were followed for first-time nonpsychiatric hospitalizations for 120 disease categories in the hospital registries. Standardized hospitalization rate ratios and absolute excess rates were calculated. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Survivors of ALL (n = 3391), AML (n = 389), and CML (n = 92) had an increased overall hospitalization rate compared with population comparisons. The rate ratio for any hospitalization was 1.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.83 to 2.07) in ALL, 3.09 (95% CI = 2.53 to 3.65) in AML, and 4.51 (95% CI = 3.03 to 6.00) in CML survivors and remained increased even 20 years from leukemia diagnosis. Corresponding absolute excess rates per 1000 person-years were 28.48 (95% CI = 24.96 to 32.00), 62.75 (95% CI = 46.00 to 79.50), and 105.31 (95% CI = 60.90 to 149.72). CONCLUSION: Leukemia survivors have an increased rate of hospitalization for medical conditions. We provide novel insight into the relative and absolute rate of hospitalization for 120 disease categories in survivors of ALL, AML, and CML, which are likely to be informative for both survivors and healthcare providers.","['Sorensen, Gitte Vrelits', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck', 'de Fine Licht, Sofie', 'Andersen, Klaus Kaa', 'Holmqvist, Anna Sallfors', 'Madanat-Harjuoja, Laura', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Bautz, Andrea', 'Lash, Timothy L', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Sorensen GV', 'Winther JF', 'de Fine Licht S', 'Andersen KK', 'Holmqvist AS', 'Madanat-Harjuoja L', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Bautz A', 'Lash TL', 'Hasle H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,PMC6748786,,2019/02/13 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['5313995 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djz016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Sep 1;111(9):943-951. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djz016.,,,,,,,,20200615,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Admission', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology']",,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

The inherent intra-tumor heterogeneity in AML is thought to play an important role in disease recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy. Although experimental protocols for cell proliferation studies are well established and widespread, they are not easily applicable to in vivo contexts, and the analysis of related time-series data is often complex to achieve. To overcome these limitations, model-driven approaches can be exploited to investigate different aspects of cell population dynamics. RESULTS: In this work, we present ProCell, a novel modeling and simulation framework to investigate cell proliferation dynamics that, differently from other approaches, takes into account the inherent stochasticity of cell division events. We apply ProCell to compare different models of cell proliferation in AML, notably leveraging experimental data derived from human xenografts in mice. ProCell is coupled with Fuzzy Self-Tuning Particle Swarm Optimization, a swarm-intelligence settings-free algorithm used to automatically infer the models parameterizations. Our results provide new insights on the intricate organization of AML cells with highly heterogeneous proliferative potential, highlighting the important role played by quiescent cells and proliferating cells characterized by different rates of division in the progression and evolution of the disease, thus hinting at the necessity to further characterize tumor cell subpopulations.

Summary: Midostaurin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)- mutated AML. FLT3 is a tyrosine kinase which plays a key role in proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition to having activity against FLT3, midostaurin inhibits several other tyrosine kinases which led to its approval for the treatment of advanced SM. Conclusion: Midostaurin offers a novel strategy to treat both FLT3-mutated AML and advanced SM. With a comparable adverse effect profile to other agents and substantial antiproliferative activity, midostaurin offers a therapeutic option for patients who have historically been difficult to treat.","['Sly, Nichole', 'Gaspar, Katie']","['Sly N', 'Gaspar K']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Care, University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, Iowa City, IA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care, University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, Iowa City, IA.', 'University of Iowa College of Pharmacy, Iowa City, IA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,,,2019/02/13 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['5310474 [pii]', '10.1093/ajhp/zxy050 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2019 Feb 9;76(5):268-274. doi: 10.1093/ajhp/zxy050.,,,,,,,,20190627,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results on mortality showed a 15%, 16% and 17% increased risk of NHL, MM and leukaemia, respectively. Greater height increased the risk of NHL by 7%, DLBCL by 10%, FL by 9%, MM by 5% and Leukaemia by 7%. WHR was associated with increased risk of DLBCL by 12%. No association was found between higher WC and risk of MM. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that general adiposity in adulthood and early adulthood, and greater height may increase the risk of almost all types of lympho-haematopoietic cancers and this adds to a growing body of evidence linking body fatness to several types of cancers.","['Abar, L', 'Sobiecki, J G', 'Cariolou, M', 'Nanu, N', 'Vieira, A R', 'Stevens, C', 'Aune, D', 'Greenwood, D C', 'Chan, D S M', 'Norat, T']","['Abar L', 'Sobiecki JG', 'Cariolou M', 'Nanu N', 'Vieira AR', 'Stevens C', 'Aune D', 'Greenwood DC', 'Chan DSM', 'Norat T']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College London, London.

PEGylation refers to the covalent attachment of poly(ethylene) glycol to the protein drug and it not only reduces the immune system activation but also decreases degradation by plasmatic proteases. However, pegaspargase is randomly PEGylated and, consequently, with a high degree of polydispersity in its final formulation. In this work we developed a site-specific N-terminus PEGylation protocol for ASNase. The monoPEG-ASNase was purified by anionic followed by size exclusion chromatography to a final purity of 99%. The highest yield of monoPEG-ASNase of 42% was obtained by the protein reaction with methoxy polyethylene glycol-carboxymethyl N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (10kDa) in 100 mM PBS at pH 7.5 and PEG:ASNase ratio of 25:1. The monoPEG-ASNase was found to maintain enzymatic stability for more days than ASNase, also was resistant to the plasma proteases like asparaginyl endopeptidase and cathepsin B. Additionally, monoPEG-ASNase was found to be potent against leukemic cell lines (MOLT-4 and REH) in vitro like polyPEG-ASNase. monoPEG-ASNase demonstrates its potential as a novel option for ALL treatment, being an inventive novelty that maintains the benefits of the current enzyme and solves challenges.","['Meneguetti, Giovanna Pastore', 'Santos, Joao Henrique Picado Madalena', 'Obreque, Karin Mariana Torres', 'Barbosa, Christiano Marcello Vaz', 'Monteiro, Gisele', 'Farsky, Sandra Helena Poliselli', 'Marim de Oliveira, Adriano', 'Angeli, Claudia Blanes', 'Palmisano, Giuseppe', 'Ventura, Sonia Patricia Marques', 'Pessoa-Junior, Adalberto', 'de Oliveira Rangel-Yagui, Carlota']","['Meneguetti GP', 'Santos JHPM', 'Obreque KMT', 'Barbosa CMV', 'Monteiro G', 'Farsky SHP', 'Marim de Oliveira A', 'Angeli CB', 'Palmisano G', 'Ventura SPM', 'Pessoa-Junior A', 'de Oliveira Rangel-Yagui C']","['Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Bionanomanufacture, Technological Research Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190212,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6372183,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/02/13 06:00,2019/11/12 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0211951 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-23431 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Feb 12;14(2):e0211951. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0211951. eCollection 2019.,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4221-9505'],['PLoS One. 2019 Oct 24;14(10):e0224592.

Furthermore, the continuous developments in the machine learning and in the high performance computing areas, are allowing a faster and more efficient analysis and processing of this type of data. However, biological information about a certain disease is normally widespread due to the use of different sequencing technologies and different manufacturers, in different experiments along the years around the world. Thus, nowadays it is of paramount importance to attain a correct integration of biologically-related data in order to achieve genuine benefits from them. For this purpose, this work presents an integration of multiple Microarray and RNA-seq platforms, which has led to the design of a multiclass study by collecting samples from the main four types of leukemia, quantified at gene expression. Subsequently, in order to find a set of differentially expressed genes with the highest discernment capability among different types of leukemia, an innovative parameter referred to as coverage is presented here. This parameter allows assessing the number of different pathologies that a certain gen is able to discern. It has been evaluated together with other widely known parameters under assessment of an ANOVA statistical test which corroborated its filtering power when the identified genes are subjected to a machine learning process at multiclass level. The optimal tuning of gene extraction evaluated parameters by means of this statistical test led to the selection of 42 highly relevant expressed genes. By the use of minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm, these genes were reordered and assessed under the operation of four different classification techniques. Outstanding results were achieved by taking exclusively the first ten genes of the ranking into consideration. Finally, specific literature was consulted on this last subset of genes, revealing the occurrence of practically all of them with biological processes related to leukemia. At sight of these results, this study underlines the relevance of considering a new parameter which facilitates the identification of highly valid expressed genes for simultaneously discerning multiple types of leukemia.","['Castillo, Daniel', 'Galvez, Juan Manuel', 'Herrera, Luis J', 'Rojas, Fernando', 'Valenzuela, Olga', 'Caba, Octavio', 'Prados, Jose', 'Rojas, Ignacio']","['Castillo D', 'Galvez JM', 'Herrera LJ', 'Rojas F', 'Valenzuela O', 'Caba O', 'Prados J', 'Rojas I']","['Department of Computer Architecture and Computer Technology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Computer Architecture and Computer Technology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Computer Architecture and Computer Technology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Computer Architecture and Computer Technology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Institute of Biopathology and Regenerative Medicine (IBIMER), Center of Biomedical Research (CIBM), University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Institute of Biopathology and Regenerative Medicine (IBIMER), Center of Biomedical Research (CIBM), University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Computer Architecture and Computer Technology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190212,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6372182,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/02/13 06:00,2019/11/12 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0212127 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-26493 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Feb 12;14(2):e0212127. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0212127. eCollection 2019.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7380-1023', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2139-0565', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3220-9389', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3426-8294']",,,20191111,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', '*Computational Biology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Machine Learning', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Sequence Analysis, RNA']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo experiments were performed in 2-mo-old atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-deficient/LDL receptor-deficient (ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-)) female mice and their wild-type C57BL/6J littermates. In in vitro experiments, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated with 7K. ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-) mice developed hypercholesterolemia accompanied by increased circulating levels of P-selectin and Eng and a disruption of NO metabolism. Functional analysis of the aorta demonstrated impaired vascular reactivity, and Western blot analysis revealed down-regulation of membrane Eng/Smad2/3/eNOS signaling in ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-) mice. 7K increased Eng expression via Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), liver X nuclear receptor, and NF-kappaB in HAECs. 7K-induced Eng expression was prevented by the treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin; 8-{[5-chloro-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) pyridine-4-carbonyl] amino}-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4, 5-dihydrobenzo[g]indazole-3-carboxamide; or by KLF6 silencing. 7K induced increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytic human leukemia promonocytic cell line cells and was prevented by Eng silencing. We concluded that hypercholesterolemia altered Eng expression and signaling, followed by endothelial or vascular dysfunction before formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-) mice. By contrast, 7K increased Eng expression and induced inflammation in HAECs, which was followed by an increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytes via endothelium, which was prevented by Eng inhibition.

Previously, we demonstrated that CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) is critical for aGVHD pathogenesis but dispensable for beneficial graft-versus-leukemia responses. As a result, we evaluated a fully human anti-CCR7-blocking antibody as a new approach to prevent aGVHD in preclinical models. Here we report that antibody R707 is able to block human CCR7 signaling and function in vitro in response to its 2 natural ligands. The antibody was less active against the murine orthologue, however, and failed to substantially limit aGVHD in a standard murine allogeneic HSCT model. Nevertheless, R707 significantly reduced xenogeneic aGVHD induced by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). R707 limited CD4(+) and in particular CD8(+) T cell expansion during the period of antibody administration. These effects were transient, however, and T cell numbers recovered after antibody cessation. R707 did not substantially impair the antitumor potential of the PBMC inoculum as antibody-treated mice retained their capacity to reject a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Collectively, these data indicate for the first time that an antibody directed against CCR7 might represent a viable new approach for aGVHD prevention.","['Fowler, Kenneth A', 'Vasilieva, Viktoria', 'Ivanova, Ekaterina', 'Rimkevich, Olga', 'Sokolov, Andrey', 'Abbasova, Svetlana', 'Kim, Eldar', 'Coghill, James M']","['Fowler KA', 'Vasilieva V', 'Ivanova E', 'Rimkevich O', 'Sokolov A', 'Abbasova S', 'Kim E', 'Coghill JM']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'MSM Protein Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'MSM Protein Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'MSM Protein Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'MSM Protein Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'MSM Protein Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'MSM Protein Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190313,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,,,2019/02/13 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajt.15298 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2019 Jul;19(7):1941-1954. doi: 10.1111/ajt.15298.

As the first essential step, the number of peripheral mononuclear cell (MNC) collection procedures is rapidly increasing. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the collection results to determine factors that affect MNC collection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed 184 collections that were performed on 169 adult allogenic donors and patients with acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or solid-organ tumors. All the leukapheresis procedures were performed after a complete cell count with differential was obtained. Total blood volume (TBV) was defined as processed blood volume divided by patient blood volume. RESULTS: There was a significant association between the precollection MNC count (pre-MNC) and the MNC yields normalized by TBV (r = 0.926; p < 0.001) and a regression formula was created to predict MNC yields. Multiple regression analyses showed that pre-MNC, TBV, and precollection hemoglobin were strongly associated with MNC yield (R (2) = 0.866; F (3180) = 388.472; p < 0.001), and pre-MNC had the greatest influence on MNC yield (beta = 0.960; p < 0.001) followed by TBV (beta = 0.302; p < 0.001), and Hgb (beta = 0.136; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the optimal time for MNC collection can be determined based on pre-MNC and that processing volume should be determined based on collection goal and pre-MNC to optimize and personalize the harvesting procedure.","['Chen, Jian', 'Goss, Cheryl', 'Avecilla, Scott T', 'Hong, Hong', 'Walsh, Eileen', 'Wuest, David', 'Maslak, Peter', 'Pessin, Melissa S']","['Chen J', 'Goss C', 'Avecilla ST', 'Hong H', 'Walsh E', 'Wuest D', 'Maslak P', 'Pessin MS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190212,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,PMC7416722,,2019/02/13 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15186 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2019 May;59(5):1765-1772. doi: 10.1111/trf.15186.

Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes whose activity is increased in different types of solid tumours. These enzymes regulate many processes associated with tumour progression. In haematological malignancy, the role of MMPs seems to be underestimated, and only metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) have been widely examined so far. In this work, differences in metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) gene expression between patients with AML and healthy individuals were assessed. The relative expression level of the MMP1 gene was obtained by a real time PCR method preceded by reverse transcription. The relative level of MMP1 gene expression in patients with AML was decreased when compared to that of the control group. The role of MMP1 in AML could be different from that in solid tumours. Decreased MMP1 gene expression in AML similar to that of MMP9, shows a greater role for MMP1 in normal haematopoiesis than in the development of leukaemic cells.","['Pietrzak, Jacek', 'Mirowski, Marek', 'Jelen, Agnieszka', 'Swiechowski, Rafal', 'Wodzinski, Damian', 'Niebudek, Katarzyna', 'Balcerczak, Ewa']","['Pietrzak J', 'Mirowski M', 'Jelen A', 'Swiechowski R', 'Wodzinski D', 'Niebudek K', 'Balcerczak E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland. jacek.pietrzak@umed.lodz.pl.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190212,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,,,2019/02/13 06:00,2019/07/26 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-019-04685-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-019-04685-y [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2019 Apr;46(2):2293-2298. doi: 10.1007/s11033-019-04685-y.

We used a mixed methods convergent design and collected quantitative data through randomized single-case experiments. We included CML patients receiving TKIs and reporting severe fatigue. Within each participant, we compared CBT to a no-treatment baseline period. Fatigue severity was measured weekly with the Checklist Individual Strength. Fatigue scores were subjected to visual analyses and randomization tests for single-case experimental designs. We conducted qualitative interviews after study participation and focused on feasibility and efficacy of CBT. Visual inspection of line graphs indicated downward trends in the expected direction for fatigue in two of the four participants. The test statistics showed a decrease in fatigue severity for all participants but randomization tests did not reach statistical significance (overall p = 0.18). Participants reported qualitative improvements in level of functioning and coping with fatigue. CBT was considered feasible and acceptable for severely fatigued CML patients. Our study provided preliminary evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of CBT for severely fatigued CML patients receiving targeted therapy.

To compare the safety and efficacy of prophylactic DLI for prevention of relapse after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from haploidentical donors (HID-SCT) and matched-sibling donors (MSD-SCT) in patients with very high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed a retrospective analysis in a cohort of 21 HID-SCT and 13 MSD-SCT recipients, displaying similar baseline characteristics except for donor's gender distribution. Grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100-day post-DLI was higher in HID-SCT group than that in MSD-SCT group (59.5% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.05). The grade 3-4 acute GVHD (17.5% vs. 7.7%), 1-year chronic GVHD (36.6% vs. 33.2%), and severe chronic GVHD (15.3% vs. 27.3%) were not statistically significant different between groups. One-year non-relapse mortality was higher in HID-SCT group than that in MSD-SCT group with marginal significance (27.9% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.061). One-year relapse rate was not statistically significant different between HID-SCT group and MSD-SCT group (21.6% vs. 36.5%, p = 0.543). For HID-SCT recipients, 1-year relapse rate was lower in patients receiving prophylactic DLI than that in a control cohort of eight patients with same very high-risk features but not receiving prophylactic DLI (62.5% vs. 28.3%, p = 0.037). No statistically significant difference was observed in 1-year overall survival (OS, 55.1% vs. 83.9%, p = 0.325) and relapse-free survival (RFS, 50.1% vs. 74.0%, p = 0.419) rates between HID-SCT group and MSD-SCT group. In multivariate analyses, non-remission status prior to transplant, poor-risk gene mutations, and donor's age >/= 48 years predicted a higher risk of relapse after DLI. Non-remission status prior to transplant predicted inferior OS and RFS. Patient's age >/= 40 years also predicted an inferior OS. In conclusion, prophylactic DLI was very safe and efficient for reducing relapse in patients with very high-risk AML receiving MSD-SCT. In the recipients of HID-SCT, the application of prophylactic DLI could reduce the risk of relapse, although with a higher incidence of DLI-associated acute GVHD than those of MSD-SCT.","['Gao, Xiao-Ning', 'Lin, Ji', 'Wang, Li-Jun', 'Li, Fei', 'Li, Hong-Hua', 'Wang, Shu-Hong', 'Huang, Wen-Rong', 'Gao, Chun-Ji', 'Yu, Li', 'Liu, Dai-Hong']","['Gao XN', 'Lin J', 'Wang LJ', 'Li F', 'Li HH', 'Wang SH', 'Huang WR', 'Gao CJ', 'Yu L', 'Liu DH']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. daihongrm@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190212,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,,2019/02/13 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03636-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03636-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 May;98(5):1267-1277. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03636-8.

METHOD: Our study included consecutive patients of any age with hematologic malignancies who were hospitalized to receive chemotherapy and suffer from persistent fever (rectal temperature >38.5 degrees C) for more than 5 days despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. A whole blood sample was taken and sent for blood culture. PCR was also conducted for Aspergillus and Candida species. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients were investigated according to the inclusion criteria. The most common hematologic malignancy was AML affecting 38 patients (37.2%). Six patients were diagnosed with invasive fungal infections (A. fumigatus n=3, C. albicans n=2, A. flavus n=1) by PCR (5.8%) while blood culture showed fungus only in 1 patient. Three more cases were known as probable IFI since they responded to antifungal therapy but the PCR result was negative for them. AML was the most prevalent malignancy in IFI patients (83.3%) and odds ratio for severing neutropenia was 21.5. Odds for each of the baseline characteristics of patients including gender, age>60, diabetes mellitus, previous IFI, history of using more than 3 antibiotics, antifungal prophylaxis, episodes of chemotherapy> 8 and chemotherapy regimen of daunarubicin+cytarabine were calculated. CONCLUSION: We found that multiplex real-time PCR assay is more accurate than blood culture in detecting fungal species and the results are prepared sooner. Among all factors, the only type of cancer (AML) and severe neutropenia, were found to be risk factors for the development of fungal infections in all hematologic cancer patients and previous IFI was a risk factor only AML patients.","['Sheikhbahaei, Saba', 'Mohammadi, Alireza', 'Sherkat, Roya', 'Naeini, Alireza Emami', 'Yaran, Majid', 'Najafi, Somaye']","['Sheikhbahaei S', 'Mohammadi A', 'Sherkat R', 'Naeini AE', 'Yaran M', 'Najafi S']","['Acquired Immunodeficiency Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Nosocomial Infection Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",101269157,,,2019/02/13 06:00,2019/08/29 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2017/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['EMIDDT-EPUB-96565 [pii]', '10.2174/1871530319666190211163245 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets. 2019;19(3):302-307. doi: 10.2174/1871530319666190211163245.,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus', 'Candida', 'Invasive fungal infection', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'hematologic cancer.']",,,,,,20190828,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Candida/isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the detailed mechanisms and potent targets of Pe-A remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the differentially expressed proteins between the Pe-A-treated group and the control group on human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. METHODS: The DEPs were analyzed by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with TMT label. The function and feature of the identified proteins were analyzed by the bioinformatic analysis. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression. RESULTS: The DEPs were primarily sub located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus by regulating 21 pathways enriched through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) are MRI techniques that quantify microstructural changes in brain white matter (WM) and DKI is regarded as the more sensitive of them. Our aim was to more thoroughly understand the nature of cognitive deficits after cranial radiotherapy (CRT) in adulthood after childhood ALL. Material and methods: Thirty-eight (21 women) ALL survivors, median age 38 (27-46) years, were investigated at median 34 years after diagnosis. All had been treated with a CRT dose of 24 Gy and with 11 years of complete hormone supplementation. DTI and DKI parameters were determined and neurocognitive tests were performed in ALL survivors and 29 matched controls. Results: ALL survivors scored lower than controls in neurocognitive tests of vocabulary, memory, learning capacity, spatial ability, executive functions, and attention (p < .001). The survivors had altered DTI parameters in the fornix, uncinate fasciculus, and ventral cingulum (all p < .05) and altered DKI parameters in the fornix, uncinate fasciculus, and dorsal and ventral cingulum (p < .05). Altered DTI parameters in the fornix were associated with impaired episodic verbal memory (r = -0.40, p < .04). The left and right uncinate fasciculus (r = 0.6, p < .001), (r = -0.5, p < .02) as well as the right ventral cingulum (r = 0.5, p < .007) were associated with impaired episodic visual memory. Altered DKI parameters in the fornix, right uncinate fasciculus (r = 0.3, r = 0.05, p = .02), and ventral cingulum (r = 0.3, p = .02) were associated with impaired results of episodic visual memory. Conclusion: ALL survivors with cognitive deficits demonstrated microstructural damage in several WM tracts that were more extensive with DKI as compared to DTI; this might be a marker of radiation and chemotherapy neurotoxicity underlying cognitive dysfunction.","['Follin, Cecilia', 'Svard, Daniel', 'van Westen, Danielle', 'Bjorkman-Burtscher, Isabella M', 'Sundgren, Pia C', 'Fjalldal, Sigridur', 'Latt, Jimmy', 'Nilsson, Markus', 'Johanson, Aki', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Follin C', 'Svard D', 'van Westen D', 'Bjorkman-Burtscher IM', 'Sundgren PC', 'Fjalldal S', 'Latt J', 'Nilsson M', 'Johanson A', 'Erfurth EM']","['a Department of Oncology , Skane University Hospital and IKVL, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'b Department of Diagnostic Radiology , Skane University Hospital and Clinical Sciences, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'c Department of Clinical Sciences and Radiology, Faculty of Medicine , Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'b Department of Diagnostic Radiology , Skane University Hospital and Clinical Sciences, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'c Department of Clinical Sciences and Radiology, Faculty of Medicine , Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'b Department of Diagnostic Radiology , Skane University Hospital and Clinical Sciences, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'd Lund University Bioimaging Center , Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'b Department of Diagnostic Radiology , Skane University Hospital and Clinical Sciences, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'e Department of Endocrinology , Skane University hospital , Lund , Sweden.', 'b Department of Diagnostic Radiology , Skane University Hospital and Clinical Sciences, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'b Department of Diagnostic Radiology , Skane University Hospital and Clinical Sciences, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'f Department of Psychiatry , Clinical Sciences, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'e Department of Endocrinology , Skane University hospital , Lund , Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190212,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,,2019/02/13 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2019.1571279 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2019 Jul;58(7):1021-1028. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2019.1571279.

Methods: After collecting the ovarian tissue samples they were divided into non-vitrified and vitrified groups and cultured for 14 days in the presence and absence of LIF then morphological, ultrastructural and steroidogenesis studies, TUNEL and caspase-3/7 assays, and apoptosis analysis by real time RT-PCR were done in all groups. The data were analyzed by independent t-tests and the real time RT-PCR results were compared by one-way ANOVA (p-values of <0.05 were considered significant). Results: No significant difference was observed between non-vitrified and vitrified groups in normality rate of follicles, the levels of hormones, TUNEL positive cells and caspase-3/7 activity. But in all LIF-treated groups, the levels of 17-beta estradiol and progesterone were higher and TUNEL signals and caspase-3/7 activity were lower than non-LIF treated groups. The expression of Fas and FasL genes was higher in vitrified group in comparison with non-vitrified group but the expression of other genes was not significantly different. In LIF-treated groups, the expression of pro-apoptotic genes was significantly lower and the expression of anti-apoptotic genes was higher than non-LIF treated group. Conclusion: The vitrification of human ovarian tissue did not increase the incidence of apoptosis at the morphological and molecular levels during long term culture and LIF improves the survival and development of cultured follicles.","['Abdollahi, Maasoume', 'Salehnia, Mojdeh', 'Salehpour, Saghar', 'Pour-Beiranvand, Shahram']","['Abdollahi M', 'Salehnia M', 'Salehpour S', 'Pour-Beiranvand S']","['Department of Anatomical Sciences, Medical Sciences Faculty, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Medical Sciences Faculty, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center (IRHRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Medical Sciences Faculty, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,J Reprod Infertil,Journal of reproduction & infertility,101535586,PMC6328982,['Conflict of Interest Authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2019/02/13 06:00,2019/02/13 06:01,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/13 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Reprod Infertil. 2018 Oct-Dec;19(4):193-202.,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Caspase-3/7', 'In vitro culture', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'Ovarian tissue', 'Vitrification']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent Findings: Although ABL kinases are known drivers of human leukemia, emerging data also implicates the kinases in a large number of solid tumor types where they promote diverse processes such as proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal reorganization, cellular polarity, EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal-transition), metabolic reprogramming, migration, invasion and metastasis via unique signaling pathways. ABL1 and ABL2 appear to have overlapping but also unique roles in driving these processes. In some tumor types, the kinases may act to integrate pro- and anti-proliferative and -invasive signals, and also may serve as a switch during EMT/MET (mesenchymal-epithelial) transitions. Conclusions: Most data indicate that targeting ABL kinases may be effective for reducing tumor growth and preventing metastasis; however, ABL kinases also may have a tumor suppressive role in some tumor types and in some cellular contexts. Understanding the functions of ABL kinases in solid tumors is critical for developing successful clinical trials aimed at targeting ABL kinases for the treatment of solid tumors.","['Tripathi, Rakshamani', 'Liu, Zulong', 'Plattner, Rina']","['Tripathi R', 'Liu Z', 'Plattner R']","['Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180723,Switzerland,Curr Pharmacol Rep,Current pharmacology reports,101649562,PMC6368175,"['Conflicts of Interest.

MicroRNA (miR)-9 has been shown to have a pivotal role in AML development. However, little is known about the role of miR-9 in Dnr resistance in AML. We explored the potential role of miR-9 in Dnr resistance in AML cells and its mechanism of action. AML cell lines with high half-maximal inhibitory concentration to Dnr in vivo had significantly low miR-9 expression. miR-9 overexpresssion sensitized AML cells to Dnr, inhibited cell proliferation, and enhanced the ability of Dnr to induce apoptosis; miR-9 knockdown had the opposite effects. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-2 (EIF5A2) was a putative target of miR-9, which was inversely correlated with the expression and role of miR-9 in AML cells. miR-9 improved the anti-tumor effects of Dnr by inhibiting myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) expression, which was dependent on downregulation of EIF5A2 expression. These results suggest that miR-9 has an essential role in Dnr resistance in AML cells through inhibition of the EIF5A2/MCL-1 axis in AML cells. Our data highlight the potential application of miR-9 in chemotherapy for AML patients.","['Liu, Yanhui', 'Lei, Pingchong', 'Qiao, Hong', 'Sun, Kai', 'Lu, Xiling', 'Bao, Fengchang', 'Yu, Runhong', 'Lian, Cheng', 'Li, Yao', 'Chen, Wei', 'Xue, Fei']","['Liu Y', 'Lei P', 'Qiao H', 'Sun K', 'Lu X', 'Bao F', 'Yu R', 'Lian C', 'Li Y', 'Chen W', 'Xue F']","[""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", ""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", 'Baoying Hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, 225800,China.', ""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", ""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", ""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", ""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", ""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", ""Department of Hemotology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China."", 'Cancer Institute of Integrated traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tongde hospital of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310012, China.', ""Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Henan University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190101,Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,PMC6367593,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2019/02/13 06:00,2020/01/21 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijbs.29775 [doi]', 'ijbsv15p0579 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2019 Jan 1;15(3):579-586. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.29775. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['*EIF5A2', '*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*drug resistance', '*micoRNA-9']",,,,,,20200120,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, SPRED1, a negative regulator of the RAS MAPK pathway, is identified as a tumour suppressor downregulated in AML. However, little is known regarding its underlying dysregulation in AML. In this study, we investigated methylation status of SPRED1 promoters and their association with mRNA levels in AML. Methods: Methylation level were measured in four regions of SPRED1 (#1: 310 bp ~ 723 bp, #2: 810 bp ~ 1299 bp, #3: 1280 bp ~ 1742 bp and #4: 1715 bp ~ 2059 bp) in a total of 16 patients with de novonon-acute promyelocytic leukemia (non-APL) and three patients who got complete remission after induction treatment using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-RT PCR) was used to analyze SPRED1 mRNA levels. Results: AML patients had a significantly higher average methylation level than controls at regions of #1_CpG_1 (p= 0.04) and #1_CpG_11 (p =0.002). The methylation values for #1_CpG_11 were negatively correlated with mRNA levels (r= -0.558, p=0.013) but there was no significant association between #1_CpG_1 methylation status and mRNA levels (r=-0.103, p=0.675) in AML patients. There was no significant difference in the methylation level when comparing with clinical biochemical parameters and treatment response (p>0.05). Mutations of epigenetic regulation genes such as DNMT3A, TET2 and IDH1/2 were most frequently observed in patients with higher methylation levels. Decreased methylation levels were revealed in three patients who got complete remission. Conclusions: Aberrant methylation statuses of the SPRED1 promoter regions are associated with the downregulation of gene transcription in AML. The methylation level is probably associated with the treatment response of AML. Mutations of epigenetic regulation genes might be involved in the epigenetic aberration of SPRED1.","['Sun, Jingwen', 'Zhang, Jinjing', 'Wang, Yue', 'Li, Yan', 'Zhang, Rui']","['Sun J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang Y', 'Li Y', 'Zhang R']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110001, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190101,Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,PMC6367533,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2019/02/13 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijms.27757 [doi]', 'ijmsv16p0324 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2019 Jan 1;16(2):324-330. doi: 10.7150/ijms.27757. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DNA methylation', 'SPRED1', 'Tumor suppressor gene']",,,,,,20190605,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Young Adult']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SPRED1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether both PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints are active and clinically significant in DLBCL is unknown. Whether PD-1 ligands expressed by tumor cells or by the microenvironment of DLBCL are critical for the PD-1 immune checkpoint is unclear. We performed immunophenotypic profiling for 405 patients with de novo DLBCL using a MultiOmyx immunofluorescence platform and simultaneously quantitated expression/coexpression of 13 immune markers to identify prognostic determinants. In both training and validation cohorts, results demonstrated a central role of the tumor immune microenvironment, and when its functionality was impaired by deficiency in tumor-infiltrating T cells and/or natural killer cells, high PD-1 expression (but not CTLA-4) on CD8(+) T cells, or PD-L1 expression on T cells and macrophages, patients had significantly poorer survival after rituximab-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) immunochemotherapy. In contrast, tumor-cell PD-L2 expression was associated with superior survival, as well as PD-L1(+)CD20(+) cells proximal (indicates interaction) to PD-1 (+) CD8(+) T cells in patients with low PD-1 (+) percentage of CD8(+) T cells. Gene-expression profiling results suggested the reversibility of T-cell exhaustion in PD-1(+)/PD-L1(+) patients with unfavorable prognosis and implication of LILRA/B, IDO1, CHI3L1, and SOD2 upregulation in the microenvironment dysfunction with PD-L1 expression. This study comprehensively characterized the DLBCL immune landscape, deciphered the differential roles of various checkpoint components in rituximab-CHOP resistance in DLBCL patients, and suggests

They are also commonly deficient for expression of ATRX protein, a repressor of ALT activity, and a component of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) that are required for intrinsic immunity to various viruses. Here, we asked whether ATRX deficiency creates a vulnerability in ALT cancer cells that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. We showed in a range of cell types that a mutant herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) lacking ICP0, a protein that degrades PML NB components including ATRX, was ten- to one thousand-fold more effective in infecting ATRX-deficient cells than wild-type ATRX-expressing cells. Infection of co-cultured primary and ATRX-deficient cancer cells revealed that mutant HSV-1 selectively killed ATRX-deficient cells. Sensitivity to mutant HSV-1 infection also correlated inversely with PML protein levels, and we showed that ATRX upregulates PML expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. These data provide a basis for predicting, based on ATRX or PML levels, which tumors will respond to a selective oncolytic herpesvirus.","['Han, Mingqi', 'Napier, Christine E', 'Frolich, Sonja', 'Teber, Erdahl', 'Wong, Ted', 'Noble, Jane R', 'Choi, Eugene H Y', 'Everett, Roger D', 'Cesare, Anthony J', 'Reddel, Roger R']","['Han M', 'Napier CE', 'Frolich S', 'Teber E', 'Wong T', 'Noble JR', 'Choi EHY', 'Everett RD', 'Cesare AJ', 'Reddel RR']","[""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia c.napier@garvan.org.au rreddel@cmri.org.au."", ""Genome Integrity Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Bioinformatics Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Bioinformatics Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Bearsden, Glasgow G61 1QH, Scotland, UK.', ""Genome Integrity Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia c.napier@garvan.org.au rreddel@cmri.org.au.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190314,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,PMC6432714,['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],2019/02/13 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.222349 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.222349 [doi]']",epublish,J Cell Sci. 2019 Mar 14;132(5). pii: jcs.222349. doi: 10.1242/jcs.222349.,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATRX', '*Oncolytic virus', '*PML', '*Post-transcriptional control', '*Sarcoma', '*Soft-tissue malignancies', '*Telomerase', '*Telomeres', '*Translational control']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2070-5967', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8009-7735', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5370-6232', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2656-0324', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3625-2213', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5841-2281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0864-1254', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6302-6107']",,,20200601,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'Herpes Simplex/*metabolism/pathology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Kidney/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein/*deficiency']","['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",,,['(c) 2019.

Because osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts play a key role in bone remodeling, and MF monocytes, the OC precursors, are derived from the neoplastic clone, we wondered whether decreased OC numbers or impairment in their osteolytic function affects the development of osteosclerosis. Analysis of BM biopsies from 50 MF patients showed increased numbers of multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)/cathepsin K(+) OCs expressing phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Randomly microdissected TRAP(+) OCs from 16 MF patients harbored JAK2 or calreticulin (CALR) mutations, confirming MF OCs are clonal. To study OC function, CD14(+) monocytes from MF patients and healthy individuals were cultured and differentiated into OCs. Unlike normal OCs, MF OCs appeared small and round, with few protrusions, and carried the mutations and chromosomal abnormalities of neoplastic clones. In addition, MF OCs lacked F-actin-rich ring-like structures and had fewer nuclei and reduced colocalization signals, compatible with decreased fusion events, and their mineral resorption capacity was significantly reduced, indicating impaired osteolytic function. Taken together, our data suggest that, although the numbers of MF OCs are increased, their impaired osteolytic activity distorts bone remodeling and contributes to the induction of osteosclerosis.","['Veletic, Ivo', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Multani, Asha S', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Chen, Lei', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Veletic I', 'Manshouri T', 'Multani AS', 'Yin CC', 'Chen L', 'Verstovsek S', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Genetics, and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas McGovern Medical School, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6533604,,2019/02/13 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42539-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-10-878926 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 May 23;133(21):2320-2324. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-10-878926.

MDS arises from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); therefore, successful elimination of MDS HSCs is an important part of any curative therapy. However, current treatment options, including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), often fail to ablate disease-initiating MDS HSCs, and thus have low curative potential and high relapse rates. Here, we demonstrate that human HSCs can be targeted and eliminated by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind cell-surface CD117 (c-Kit). We show that an anti-human CD117 mAb, SR-1, inhibits normal cord blood and bone marrow HSCs in vitro. Furthermore, SR-1 and clinical-grade humanized anti-human CD117 mAb, AMG 191, deplete normal and MDS HSCs in vivo in xenograft mouse models. Anti-CD117 mAbs also facilitate the engraftment of normal donor human HSCs in MDS xenograft mouse models, restoring normal human hematopoiesis and eradicating aggressive pathologic MDS cells. This study is the first to demonstrate that anti-human CD117 mAbs have potential as novel therapeutics to eradicate MDS HSCs and augment the curative effect of allogeneic HCT for this disease. Moreover, we establish the foundation for use of these antibody agents not only in the treatment of MDS but also for the multitude of other HSC-driven blood and immune disorders for which transplant can be disease-altering.","['Pang, Wendy W', 'Czechowicz, Agnieszka', 'Logan, Aaron C', 'Bhardwaj, Rashmi', 'Poyser, Jessica', 'Park, Christopher Y', 'Weissman, Irving L', 'Shizuru, Judith A']","['Pang WW', 'Czechowicz A', 'Logan AC', 'Bhardwaj R', 'Poyser J', 'Park CY', 'Weissman IL', 'Shizuru JA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, and.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratories, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratories, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, New York University, New York, NY; and.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA.', 'Ludwig Center for Cancer Cell Research, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, and.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6509544,,2019/02/13 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42577-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-06-858159 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 May 9;133(19):2069-2078. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-06-858159.

Some of these infections are vaccine preventable. However, these malignancies are different from each other, and the treatment approaches are diverse and rapidly evolving, so it is difficult to have a common programme for vaccination in a haematology ward. Additionally, because of insufficient training about the topic, vaccination is an area often neglected by haematologists, and influenced by cultural differences, even among health-care workers, in compliance to vaccines. Several issues are encountered when addressing vaccination in haematology: the small size of the cohorts that makes it difficult to show the clinical benefits of vaccination, the subsequent need to rely on biological parameters, their clinical pertinence not being established in immunocompromised patients, scarcity of clarity on the optimal timing of vaccination in complex treatment schedules, and the scarcity of data on long-term protection in patients receiving treatments. Moreover, the risk of vaccine-induced disease with live-attenuated vaccines strongly limits their use. Here we summarise guidelines for patients without transplantations, and address the issue by the haematological group-myeloid and lymphoid-of diseases, with a special consideration for children with acute leukaemia.","['Mikulska, Malgorzata', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Di Blasi, Roberta', 'Einarsdottir, Sigrun', 'Gallo, Giuseppe', 'Rieger, Christina', 'Engelhard, Dan', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Cordonnier, Catherine']","['Mikulska M', 'Cesaro S', 'de Lavallade H', 'Di Blasi R', 'Einarsdottir S', 'Gallo G', 'Rieger C', 'Engelhard D', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Ljungman P', 'Cordonnier C']","['University of Genoa (DISSAL) and IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Mother and Child, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', ""Deparment of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", 'Haematology Department, Henri Mondor Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Creteil, France.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sahlgrenska Academy, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Department of Mother and Child, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, University of Munich, Germering, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Ein-Kerem Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Department, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Cellular Therapy and Allogenenic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Haematology Department, Henri Mondor Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Creteil, France; University Paris-Est Creteil, Creteil, France.

Some of these infections are preventable by vaccination. Most HSCT recipients lose their immunity to various pathogens as soon as the first months after transplant, irrespective of the pre-transplant donor or recipient vaccinations. Vaccination with inactivated vaccines is safe after transplantation and is an effective way to reinstate protection from various pathogens (eg, influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae), especially for pathogens whose risk of infection is increased by the transplant procedure. The response to vaccines in patients with transplants is usually lower than that in healthy individuals of the same age during the first months or years after transplant, but it improves over time to become close to normal 2-3 years after the procedure. However, because immunogenic vaccines have been found to induce a response in a substantial proportion of the patients as early as 3 months after transplant, we recommend to start crucial vaccinations with inactivated vaccines from 3 months after transplant, irrespectively of whether the patient has or has not developed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or received immunosuppressants. Patients with GvHD have higher risk of infection and are likely to benefit from vaccination. Another challenge is to provide HSCT recipients the same level of vaccine protection as healthy individuals of the same age in a given country. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be limited to specific situations because of the risk of vaccine-induced disease.","['Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Einarsdottir, Sigrun', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Di Blasi, Roberta', 'Mikulska, Malgorzata', 'Rieger, Christina', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Gallo, Giuseppe', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Engelhard, Dan', 'Ljungman, Per']","['Cordonnier C', 'Einarsdottir S', 'Cesaro S', 'Di Blasi R', 'Mikulska M', 'Rieger C', 'de Lavallade H', 'Gallo G', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Engelhard D', 'Ljungman P']","['Haematology Department, Henri Mondor Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Creteil, France; University Paris-Est Creteil, Creteil, France.

The tumor suppressor genes RB1 (retinoblastoma) and CDKN2a (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a) are critical cell-cycle regulators, but their roles in human cardiomyogenesis remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that developmental activation of RB1 and CDKN2a cooperatively cause permanent cell-cycle withdrawal of human cardiac precursors (CPCs) driving terminal differentiation into mature cardiomyocytes, and that dual inactivation of these tumor suppressor genes promotes myocyte cell-cycle reentry. METHODS AND RESULTS: Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into cardiomyocytes revealed that RB1 and CDKN2a are upregulated at the onset of cardiac precursor specification, simultaneously with GATA4 (GATA-binding protein 4) homeobox genes PBX1 (pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1) and MEIS1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog), and remain so until terminal cardiomyocyte differentiation. In both GATA4(+) hPSC cardiac precursors and postmitotic hPSC-cardiomyocytes, RB1 is hyperphosphorylated and inactivated. Transient, stage-specific, depletion of RB1 during hPSC differentiation enhances cardiomyogenesis at the cardiac precursors stage, but not in terminally differentiated hPSC-cardiomyocytes, by transiently upregulating GATA4 expression through a cell-cycle regulatory pathway involving CDKN2a. Importantly, cytokinesis in postmitotic hPSC-cardiomyocytes can be induced with transient, dual RB1, and CDKN2a silencing. The relevance of this pathway in vivo was suggested by findings in a porcine model of cardiac cell therapy post-MI, whereby dual RB1 and CDKN2a inactivation in adult GATA4(+) cells correlates with the degree of scar size reduction and endogenous cardiomyocyte mitosis, particularly in response to combined transendocardial injection of adult human hMSCs (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells) and cKit(+) cardiac cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together these findings reveal an important and coordinated role for RB1 and CDKN2a in regulating cell-cycle progression and differentiation during human cardiomyogenesis. Moreover, transient, dual inactivation of RB1 and CDKN2a in endogenous adult GATA4(+) cells and cardiomyocytes mediates, at least in part, the beneficial effects of cell-based therapy in a post-MI large mammalian model, a finding with potential clinical implications.","['Hatzistergos, Konstantinos E', 'Williams, Adam R', 'Dykxhoorn, Derek', 'Bellio, Michael A', 'Yu, Wendou', 'Hare, Joshua M']","['Hatzistergos KE', 'Williams AR', 'Dykxhoorn D', 'Bellio MA', 'Yu W', 'Hare JM']","['From the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute (K.E.H., A.R.W., M.A.B., W.Y., J.M.H.), University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL.', 'Department of Cell Biology (K.E.H.), University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL.', 'From the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute (K.E.H., A.R.W., M.A.B., W.Y., J.M.H.), University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL.', 'Department of Surgery (A.R.W.), University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL.', 'Department of Surgery, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC (A.R.W.).', 'Department of Human Genetics (D.D.), University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, FL.', 'John P.

Utilizing Friend virus (FV), an oncogenic mouse retrovirus, we investigated the effect of IgG-opsonization of retroviral particles on the infection of DCs and the subsequent presentation of viral antigens by DCs to virus-specific CD8 T cells. We found that opsonization by virus-specific non-neutralizing IgG abrogated DC infection and as a consequence significantly reduced the capacity of DCs to activate virus-specific CD8 T cells. Effects of IgG-opsonization were mediated by the high-affinity FcgammaR type I, CD64, expressed on DCs. Our results suggest that different opsonization patterns on the retroviral surface modulate infection and antigen-presenting functions of DCs, whereby, in contrast to complement, IgG reduces the capacity of DCs to activate cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses.","['Banki, Zoltan', 'Werner, Roland', 'Riepler, Lydia', 'Rossler, Annika', 'Mullauer, Brigitte', 'Hegen, Verena', 'Bayer, Wibke', 'Verbeek, J Sjef', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Stoiber, Heribert']","['Banki Z', 'Werner R', 'Riepler L', 'Rossler A', 'Mullauer B', 'Hegen V', 'Bayer W', 'Verbeek JS', 'Dittmer U', 'Stoiber H']","['Division of Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria. zoltan.banki@i-med.ac.at.', 'Division of Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria. rol.w@gmx.net.', 'Division of Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.

Because magnetic fields are correlated with distance from lines, the question of whether the risk is due to magnetic fields exposure or to some other factor associated with distance from lines is unresolved. We used data from a large records-based case-control study to examine several research questions formulated to disentangle the relationships among magnetic fields, distance from high voltage lines, and childhood leukemia risk. In models examining an interaction between distance and magnetic fields exposure, we found that neither close proximity to high voltage lines alone nor exposure to high calculated fields alone were associated with childhood leukemia risk. Rather, elevated risk was confined to the group that was both very close to high voltage lines (<50m) and had high calculated fields (>/=0.4muT) (odds ratio 4.06, 95% CI 1.16, 14.3). Further, high calculated fields (>/=0.4 muT) that were due solely to lower voltage lines (<200kV) were not associated with elevated risk; rather, risk was confined to high fields attributable to high voltage lines. Whilst other explanations are possible, our findings argue against magnetic fields as a sole explanation for the association between distance and childhood leukemia and in favor of some other explanation linked to characteristics of power lines.","['Crespi, Catherine M', 'Swanson, John', 'Vergara, Ximena P', 'Kheifets, Leeka']","['Crespi CM', 'Swanson J', 'Vergara XP', 'Kheifets L']","['UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, 650 Charles E.

Duvelisib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for relapsed or refractory (RR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and RR follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more prior systemic therapies. On the basis of the activity of duvelisib, a first-in-class oral dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-delta,-gamma, in RR iNHL in a phase I study, the safety and efficacy of duvelisib monotherapy was evaluated in iNHL refractory to rituximab and either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had measurable iNHL (FL, SLL, or marginal zone B-cell lymphoma) double refractory to rituximab (monotherapy or in combination) and to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy. All were treated with duvelisib 25 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) using the revised International Working Group criteria for malignant lymphoma. RESULTS: This open-label, global phase II trial enrolled 129 patients (median age, 65 years; median of three prior lines of therapy) with an ORR of 47.3% (SLL, 67.9%; FL, 42.2%; MZL, 38.9%). The estimated median duration of response was 10 months, and the estimated median progression-free survival was 9.5 months. The most frequent any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea (48.8%), nausea (29.5%), neutropenia (28.7%), fatigue (27.9%), and cough (27.1%). Among the 88.4% of patients with at least one grade 3 or greater TEAE, the most common TEAEs were neutropenia (24.8%), diarrhea (14.7%), anemia (14.7%), and thrombocytopenia (11.6%). CONCLUSION: In the DYNAMO study, oral duvelisib monotherapy demonstrated clinically meaningful activity and a manageable safety profile in heavily pretreated, double-refractory iNHL, consistent with previous observations. Duvelisib may provide a new oral treatment option for this patient population of which many are elderly and in need of additional therapies.","['Flinn, Ian W', 'Miller, Carole B', 'Ardeshna, Kirit M', 'Tetreault, Scott', 'Assouline, Sarit E', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Merli, Michele', 'Lunin, Scott D', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Nagy, Zoltan', 'Tournilhac, Olivier', 'Abou-Nassar, Karem-Etienne', 'Crump, Michael', 'Jacobsen, Eric D', 'de Vos, Sven', 'Kelly, Virginia M', 'Shi, Weiliang', 'Steelman, Lori', 'Le, NgocDiep', 'Weaver, David T', 'Lustgarten, Stephanie', 'Wagner-Johnston, Nina D', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi']","['Flinn IW', 'Miller CB', 'Ardeshna KM', 'Tetreault S', 'Assouline SE', 'Mayer J', 'Merli M', 'Lunin SD', 'Pettitt AR', 'Nagy Z', 'Tournilhac O', 'Abou-Nassar KE', 'Crump M', 'Jacobsen ED', 'de Vos S', 'Kelly VM', 'Shi W', 'Steelman L', 'Le N', 'Weaver DT', 'Lustgarten S', 'Wagner-Johnston ND', 'Zinzani PL']","['1 Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, TN.', '2 Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, TN.', '3 Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD.', '4 University College London Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '5 Florida Cancer Specialists, Tallahassee, FL.', '6 McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '7 Fakultni Nemocnice Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', '8 Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi, Varese, Italy.', '5 Florida Cancer Specialists, Tallahassee, FL.', '9 University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', '10 Semmelweis Egyetem, Budapest, Hungary.', '11 Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Estaing, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""12 Centre integre de sante et de services sociaux de l'Outaouais, Gatineau, Quebec, Canada."", '13 Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '14 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', '15 Ronald Reagan University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', '16 Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', '16 Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', '16 Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', '17 Verastem Oncology, Needham, MA.', '17 Verastem Oncology, Needham, MA.', '17 Verastem Oncology, Needham, MA.', '18 Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO.', '19 University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.00915 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Apr 10;37(11):912-922. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.00915.

We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of children and young adults with hypodiploid B-ALL who were enrolled in recent Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials to evaluate the impact of HSCT on outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic analyses and DNA index were performed at COG-approved laboratories, and hypodiploidy was defined as modal chromosome number less than 44 and/or DNA index less than 0.81. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was determined centrally using flow cytometry at two reference laboratories. Patients with hypodiploid ALL came off protocol therapy postinduction and we retrospectively collected details on their subsequent therapy and outcomes. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated for the cohort. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2011, 8,522 patients with National Cancer Institute standard-risk and high-risk B-ALL were enrolled in COG AALL03B1 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00482352). Hypodiploidy occurred in 1.5% of patients (n = 131), 98.3% of whom achieved CR after induction therapy. Five-year EFS and OS were 52.2% +/- 4.9% and 58.9% +/- 4.8%, respectively. Outcomes for patients undergoing CR1 HSCT were not significantly improved: 5-year EFS and OS were 57.4% +/- 7.0% and 66.2% +/- 6.6% compared with 47.8% +/- 7.5% and 53.8% +/- 7.6%, respectively ( P = .49 and .34, respectively) for those who did not undergo transplantation. Patients with MRD of 0.01% or greater at the end of induction had 5-year EFS and OS of 26.7% +/- 9.3% and 29.3% +/- 10.1%, respectively, and HSCT had no significant impact on outcomes. CONCLUSION: Children and young adults with hypodiploid B-ALL continue to fare poorly and do not seem to benefit from CR1 HSCT. This is especially true for patients with MRD of 0.01% or greater at the end of induction. New treatment strategies are urgently needed for these patients.","['McNeer, Jennifer L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Kahwash, Samir B', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Mattano, Leonard', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A']","['McNeer JL', 'Devidas M', 'Dai Y', 'Carroll AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Kahwash SB', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood BL', 'Larsen E', 'Maloney KW', 'Mattano L', 'Winick NJ', 'Schultz KR', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Loh ML', 'Raetz EA']","['1 University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', '2 University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', '2 University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', '3 University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', '4 The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', ""5 Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", ""5 Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", '6 Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.', '7 University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', ""8 Maine Children's Cancer Program, Scarborough, ME."", ""9 Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO."", '10 HARP Pharma Consulting, Mystic, CT.', '11 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', ""12 BC Children's Hospital and Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""13 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", '14 New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', '15 University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', '14 New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC6440386,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.00884 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Apr 1;37(10):780-789. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.00884.

Usually, the discovery of new irreversible kinase inhibitors occurs serendipitously, showing that efficient rational approaches for the rapid discovery of new drugs are needed. Herein, we report a virtual screening strategy that led to the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. A virtual screening library was designed to target the highly conserved Cys828 residue preceding the DFG motif by modification of reported reversible inhibitors with chemically reactive groups. Prospective covalent docking allowed the identification of two lead series, resulting in a massive increase in inhibition of kinase activity and cell viability by irreversible inhibitors compared to the corresponding reversible scaffolds.

However, our study reveals a more complicated mechanism. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of KPNB1 potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis selectively in glioblastoma cells mainly by unfolded protein response (UPR). First, it augmented ATF4-mediated DR5 expression and promoted the assembly of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Second, it freed Bax and Bak from Mcl-1. Third, it downregulated FLIPL and FLIPS, inhibitors of caspase-8 cleavage, partly through upregulating ATF4-induced 4E-BP1 expression and disrupting the cap-dependent translation initiation. Meanwhile, KPNB1 inhibition-induced undesirable autophagy and accelerated cleaved caspase-8 clearance. Inhibition of autophagic flux maintained cleaved caspase-8 and aggravated apoptosis induced by KPNB1 inhibitor plus TRAIL, which were abolished by caspase-8 inhibitor. These results unveil new molecular mechanism for optimizing TRAIL-directed therapeutic efficacy against cancer.","['Zhu, Zhi-Chuan', 'Liu, Ji-Wei', 'Yang, Can', 'Li, Ming-Jie', 'Wu, Rong-Jie', 'Xiong, Zhi-Qi']","['Zhu ZC', 'Liu JW', 'Yang C', 'Li MJ', 'Wu RJ', 'Xiong ZQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. xiongzhiqi@ion.ac.cn.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. xiongzhiqi@ion.ac.cn.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China. xiongzhiqi@ion.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC6370806,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/02/13 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1383-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1383-x [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Feb 11;10(2):118. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1383-x.,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0327-9978'],,,20200212,IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'beta Karyopherins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']","['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (KPNB1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (beta Karyopherins)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FBXW7 encodes three isoforms, alpha, beta and gamma, which differ only in the N-terminus. In this work, massive sequencing revealed significant downregulation of FBXW7 in a panel of primary T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas characterised by the absence of mutations in its sequence. We observed that decreased expression mainly affected the FBXW7beta isoform and to a lesser extent FBXW7alpha and may be attributed to the combined effect of epigenetic changes, alteration of upstream factors and upregulation of miRNAs. Transient transfections with miRNA mimics in selected cell lines resulted in a significant decrease of total FBXW7 expression and its different isoforms separately, with the consequent increment of critical substrates and the stimulation of cell proliferation. Transient inhibition of endogenous miRNAs in a T-cell lymphoblastic-derived cell line (SUP-T1) was capable of reversing these proliferative effects. Finally, we show how FBXW7 isoforms display different roles within the cell. Simultaneous downregulation of the alpha and gamma isoforms modulates the amount of CCNE1, whilst the beta-isoform alone was found to have a prominent role in modulating the amount of c-MYC. Our data also revealed that downregulation of all isoforms is a sine qua non condition to induce a proliferative pattern in our cell model system. Taking these data into account, potential new treatments to reverse downregulation of all or a specific FBXW7 isoform may be an effective strategy to counteract the proliferative capacity of these tumour cells.","['Vazquez-Dominguez, Irene', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez, Laura', 'Lopez-Nieva, Pilar', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Pablo', 'Villa-Morales, Maria', 'Cobos-Fernandez, Maria A', 'Sastre, Isabel', 'F Fraga, Mario', 'F Fernandez, Agustin', 'Malumbres, Marcos', 'Salazar-Roa, Maria', 'Grana-Castro, Osvaldo', 'Santos, Javier', 'Llamas, Pilar', 'Lopez-Lorenzo, Jose L', 'Fernandez-Piqueras, Jose']","['Vazquez-Dominguez I', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez L', 'Lopez-Nieva P', 'Fernandez-Navarro P', 'Villa-Morales M', 'Cobos-Fernandez MA', 'Sastre I', 'F Fraga M', 'F Fernandez A', 'Malumbres M', 'Salazar-Roa M', 'Grana-Castro O', 'Santos J', 'Llamas P', 'Lopez-Lorenzo JL', 'Fernandez-Piqueras J']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Consorcio de Investigacion Biomedica de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Consorcio de Investigacion Biomedica de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Epidemiologia Ambiental y Cancer, Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Consorcio de Investigacion Biomedica de Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Consorcio de Investigacion Biomedica de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion en Nanomateriales y Nanotecnologia (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo-Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Unidad de Epigenetica del Cancer, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), Fundacion para la Investigacion Biosanitaria de Asturias (FINBA), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA-HUCA), Oviedo, Spain.', 'Grupo de Division Celular y Cancer, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Grupo de Division Celular y Cancer, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioinformatica, Biologia Estructural y Biocomputacion, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Ocologicas (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Consorcio de Investigacion Biomedica de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain. jfpiqueras@cbm.csic.es.', 'IIS Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain. jfpiqueras@cbm.csic.es.', 'Consorcio de Investigacion Biomedica de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain. jfpiqueras@cbm.csic.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,2019/02/12 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0746-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0746-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Jun;38(23):4620-4636. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0746-1.

One of the most common aberrations, inversion of chromosome 16 [inv(16)], generates the fusion oncogene CBFB-MYH11. Previously, we used a mouse knock-in model to show that Cbfb-MYH11 induces changes in gene expression and results in the accumulation of abnormal myeloid cells, a subset of which are enriched for leukemia stem cell (LSC) activity. One gene upregulated by Cbfb-MYH11 encodes the cytokine receptor IL1RL1 (ST2). IL1RL1 and its ligand IL-33 are known regulators of mature myeloid cells, but their roles in AML are not known. Here, we use Cbfb-MYH11 knock-in mice to show that IL1RL1 is expressed by cell populations with high LSC activity, and that the cell surface expression of IL1RL1 is dynamic, implying that the expression of IL1RL1 is not restricted to a specific stage of differentiation. We also show that treatment with IL-33 increased serial replating ability and expression of pro-survival proteins in vitro. Finally, we show that IL1RL1(+) cells can survive chemotherapy better than IL1RL1(-) cells in vivo. Collectively, our results indicate that IL1RL1 is dynamically expressed in Cbfb-MYH11(+) leukemia cells and promotes their survival.","['Wang, Yiqian', 'Richter, Lisa', 'Becker, Michelle', 'Amador, Catalina', 'Hyde, R Katherine']","['Wang Y', 'Richter L', 'Becker M', 'Amador C', 'Hyde RK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, United States. kate.hyde@unmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6370767,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-38408-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-38408-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Feb 11;9(1):1729. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-38408-3.,,,['R00 CA148963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,20200824,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (CSF2RB protein, human)', '0 (Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit)', '0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of Fli-1 induces hematopoietic and solid tumors, rendering it an important target for therapeutic intervention. Through high content screens of a library of chemicals isolated from medicinal plants in China for inhibitors of a Fli-1 transcriptional reporter cells, we hereby report the identification of diterpenoid-like compounds that strongly inhibit Fli-1 transcriptional activity. These agents suppressed the growth of erythroleukemic cells by inducing apoptosis and differentiation. They also inhibited survival and proliferation of B-cell leukemic cell lines as well as primary B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) isolated from 7 patients. Moreover, these inhibitors blocked leukemogenesis in a mouse model of erythroleukemia, in which Fli-1 is the driver of tumor initiation. Computational docking analysis revealed that the diterpenoid-like compounds bind with high affinity to nucleotide residues in a pocket near the major groove within the DNA-binding sites of Fli-1. Functional inhibition of Fli-1 by these compounds triggered its further downregulation through miR-145, whose promoter is normally repressed by Fli-1. These results uncover the importance of Fli-1 in leukemogenesis, a Fli-1-miR145 autoregulatory loop and new anti-Fli-1 diterpenoid agents for the treatment of diverse hematological malignancies overexpressing this transcription factor.","['Liu, Tangjingjun', 'Xia, Lei', 'Yao, Yao', 'Yan, Chen', 'Fan, Yanhua', 'Gajendran, Babu', 'Yang, Jue', 'Li, You-Jun', 'Chen, Juan', 'Filmus, Jorge',

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ANAs as a prognostic factor in CLL. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 216 newly diagnosed CLL subjects with ANAs test from 2007 to 2017. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen the independent prognostic factors related to time to first treatment (TTFT), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver operator characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) were utilized to assess the predictive accuracy of ANAs together with other independent factors for OS. RESULTS: The incidence of ANAs abnormality at diagnosis was 13.9%. ANAs positivity and TP53 disruption were independent prognostic indicators for OS. The AUC of positive ANAs together with TP53 disruption was 0.766 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.697-0.826), which was significantly larger than that of either TP53 disruption (AUC: 0.706, 95% CI: 0.634-0.772, P = 0.034) or positive ANAs (AUC: 0.595, 95% CI: 0.520-0.668, P < 0.001) in OS prediction. Besides, serum positive ANAs as one additional parameter to CLL-international prognostic index (IPI) obtained superior AUCs in predicting CLL OS than CLL-IPI alone. CONCLUSION: This study identified ANAs as an independent prognostic factor for CLL, and further investigations are needed to validate this finding.","['Sun, Qian', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Miao,

Data from critically ill patients with neutropenic enterocolitis are scarce. Our objectives were to describe the population of patients with neutropenic enterocolitis admitted to an ICU and to investigate the risk factors of invasive fungal disease. DESIGN: A multicentric retrospective cohort study between January 2010 and August 2017. SETTING: Six French ICUs members of the Groupe de Recherche Respiratoire en Onco-Hematologie research network. PATIENTS: Adult neutropenic patients hospitalized in the ICU with a diagnosis of enteritis and/or colitis. Patients with differential diagnosis (Clostridium difficile colitis, viral colitis, inflammatory enterocolitis, mesenteric ischemia, radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, and Graft vs Host Disease) were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 134 patients (median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 10 [8-12]), with 38.8% hospital mortality and 32.1% ICU mortality rates. The main underlying malignancies were acute leukemia (n = 65, 48.5%), lymphoma (n = 49, 36.6%), solid tumor (n = 14, 10.4%), and myeloma (n = 4, 3.0%). Patients were neutropenic during a median of 14 days (9-22 d). Infection was documented in 81 patients (60.4%), including an isolated bacterial infection in 64 patients (47.8%), an isolated fungal infection in nine patients (6.7%), and a coinfection with both pathogens in eight patients (5.0%). Radiologically assessed enteritis (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.32-7.56; p = 0.015) and HIV infection (odds ratio, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.21-3.31; p = 0.016) were independently associated with invasive fungal disease. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of invasive fungal disease reaches 20% in patients with neutropenic enterocolitis when enteritis is considered. To avoid treatment delay, antifungal therapy might be systematically discussed in ICU patients admitted for neutropenic enterocolitis with radiologically assessed enteritis.","['Duceau, Baptiste', 'Picard, Muriel', 'Pirracchio, Romain', 'Wanquet, Anne', 'Pene, Frederic', 'Merceron, Sybille', 'Mokart, Djamel', 'Moreau, Anne-Sophie', 'Lengline, Etienne', 'Canet, Emmanuel', 'Lemiale, Virginie', 'Mariotte, Eric', 'Azoulay, Elie', 'Zafrani, Lara']","['Duceau B', 'Picard M', 'Pirracchio R', 'Wanquet A', 'Pene F', 'Merceron S', 'Mokart D', 'Moreau AS', 'Lengline E', 'Canet E', 'Lemiale V', 'Mariotte E', 'Azoulay E', 'Zafrani L']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Intensive Care Unit, CHU de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Unit, European Hospital Georges Pompidou, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, INSERM U-1153, Paris, France.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Paoli-Calmettes Institute, Marseille, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Cochin, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Le Chesnay, France.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Paoli-Calmettes Institute, Marseille, France.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Salengro Hospital, CHU-Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CCM.0000000000003687 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2019 May;47(5):668-676. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000003687.,,,,,,,,20200217,IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Illness/*mortality/therapy', 'Enterocolitis, Neutropenic/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index']",['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such cases fall into either AML with myelodysplasia-related changes or therapy-related AML in the current World Health Organization classification of AML. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is one of the only treatment modalities that can provide a long-term survival benefit and is recommended as a consolidative treatment in patients who are able to achieve complete remission. Unfortunately, transplantation is also associated with a higher relapse rate and more than half of CK-AML patients relapse from disease within the first 2 years. The probability of achieving remission with traditional induction using cytarabine and daunorubicin or idarubicin (""7 + 3"") is so small that investigational therapies should be considered up front in these patients. Less intensive therapeutic backbones, typically using one of the hypomethylating agents, azacitidine or decitabine, minimize toxicity and show a trend toward the improved overall survival. CPX 351 (Vyxeos) is a liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin and this encapsulation leads to prolonged exposure to the two drugs. This drug is approved for AML patients with MDS-related changes and therapy-related AML, both of which are frequently associated with complex karyotype. Such patients show improved outcome in trials using this combination. Combination therapy that includes venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) with hypomethylating agents may also be appropriate for such patients.","['Daneshbod, Yahya', 'Kohan, Leila', 'Taghadosi, Vahideh', 'Weinberg, Olga K', 'Arber, Daniel A']","['Daneshbod Y', 'Kohan L', 'Taghadosi V', 'Weinberg OK', 'Arber DA']","['Shiraz Molecular Pathology Research Center, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Shiraz Molecular Pathology Research Center, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Islamic Azad University, Arsanjan Branch, Arsanjan, Iran.', 'Shiraz Molecular Pathology Research Center, Shiraz, Iran.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, 300 Longwood Ave Bader 135, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.

Accumulating evidence has proven that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in wound healing. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to research the role of miR-124 in wound healing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Keratinocytes were respectively transfected with miR-124 mimic, scrambled miRNA (a negative control of miR-124 mimic: mimic NC), antisense oligonucleotides against miR-124 (ASOmiR124), or a negative control of ASO-miR-124 (ASO-NC), and then cell viability, colony formation, cell cycle, expression of cell cycle-associated proteins, and collagen content were all evaluated. The target gene of miR-124 was predicted using TargetScan and verified with luciferase assay. Subsequently, the effects of target gene overexpression on cell viability, colony formation and collagen synthesis were all evaluated. Finally, the expression levels of key kinases in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were detected using western blot analysis. RESULTS: Cell viability, colony formation, expression levels of cell cycle-associated proteins, and collagen content were all significantly reduced by miR-124 overexpression. As predicted using bioinformatics and validated with luciferase assay, stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) is a target gene of miR-124. Meanwhile, the miR-124 mimic-induced decrease in cell viability, colony formation and collagen synthesis was reversed by SERP1 overexpression. Furthermore, the miR-124 mimic obviously upregulated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) while downregulating beta-catenin, T cell transcription factor 4 (TCF-4) and leukemia enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1). Additionally, all the effects of ASO-miR-124 were the opposite of those of the miR-124 mimic. CONCLUSIONS: We found that miR-124 inhibited keratinocyte proliferation, collagen biosynthesis and activation of Wnt/beta-catenin by targeting SERP1.","['Zhang, Guohui', 'Song, Kunxiu', 'Yan, Hongshan']","['Zhang G', 'Song K', 'Yan H']","['Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, China.', 'Department of Hand and Microsurgery, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, China.', 'Jiangsu Liyang Zhimeixing Medical Cosmetic Clinic, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,,,2019/02/12 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/94163 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2019 Jun;28(6):711-718. doi: 10.17219/acem/94163.,['NOTNLM'],"['Wnt/beta-catenin pathway', 'collagen biosynthesis', 'keratinocyte proliferation', 'miR-124', 'wound healing']",,,,,,20190812,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Keratinocytes', 'Membrane Proteins', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', '*Wound Healing', '*beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']","['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (SFRP1 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its role in carcinomagenesis has been widely studied in solid tumors but remains controversial, depending on the cancer type. Although CD9 seems to be associated with unfavorable outcome and disease progression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), this marker has not yet been studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). First, we explored its prognostic role and its association with biological factors in a cohort of 112 AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. CD9 was expressed in 40% of AML and was associated with a favorable outcome (event-free survival and relapse-free survival) in univariate (P = 0.009 and P = 0.048, respectively) and multivariate (P = 0.004 and P = 0.039, respectively) analyses. Interestingly, CD9 expression was different between the more immature physiologic and AML cells (CD34+CD38-) as it was also expressed in AML on putative leukemic stem cells (LSCs) but not on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Hence, CD9 could be a very relevant marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in AML based on LSC targeting.","['Touzet, Lucas', 'Dumezy, Florent', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Bories, Claire', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Boyer, Thomas']","['Touzet L', 'Dumezy F', 'Roumier C', 'Berthon C', 'Bories C', 'Quesnel B', 'Preudhomme C', 'Boyer T']","['Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190210,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6434215,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2007 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Mar;8(3):1279-1288. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2007.

Genetic abnormalities have been identified in a number of ALL cases, although these alone are not sufficient for leukaemic transformation. Various in utero and post-natal environmental exposures have been suggested to alter risk of childhood ALL. DNA methylation patterns can be influenced by environmental exposures, and are reported to be altered in ALL, suggesting a potential mediating mechanism between environment and ALL disease risk. To investigate this, we used a 'meet in the middle' approach, investigating the overlap between exposure-associated and disease-associated methylation change. Genome-wide DNA methylation changes in response to possible ALL-risk exposures (i.e. breast feeding, infection history, day care attendance, maternal smoking, alcohol, caffeine, folic acid, iron and radiation exposure) were investigated in a sub-population of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort using an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) approach (n = 861-927), and compared to a list of ALL disease-associated methylation changes compiled from published data. Hypergeometric probability tests suggested that the number of directionally concordant gene methylation changes observed in ALL disease and in response to the following exposures; maternal radiation exposure (p = 0.001), alcohol intake (p = 0.006); sugary caffeinated drink intake during pregnancy (p = 0.045); and infant day care attendance (p = 0.003), were not due to chance. Data presented suggests that DNA methylation may be one mediating mechanism in the multiple hit pathway needed for ALL disease manifestation.","['Timms, Jessica A', 'Relton, Caroline L', 'Sharp, Gemma C', 'Rankin, Judith', 'Strathdee, Gordon', 'McKay, Jill A']","['Timms JA', 'Relton CL', 'Sharp GC', 'Rankin J', 'Strathdee G', 'McKay JA']","['Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom.', ""Research Oncology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, London."", 'MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', ""Research Oncology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, London."", 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Applied Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190319,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,PMC6790139,,2019/02/12 06:00,2020/02/01 06:00,['2019/02/12 06:00'],"['2018/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32203 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Dec 1;145(11):2933-2943. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32203.

Using Medicare claims linked to Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), we examined outpatient chemotherapy use during shortage periods relative to the months before and after a shortage for newly diagnosed patients with breast, colorectal, leukemia, lung, lymphoma, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer (N = 182,470). For most drugs, we found little impact of shortages on either the fraction of patients receiving that drug or the quantity provided. In some cases, we found declines in utilization: 4% for doxorubicin and fluorouracil; 2.9% for oxaliplatin; and about 1% for cytarabine, dacarbazine, and leuprolide. Although shortages for a few drugs resulted in substantial reductions in use, in most cases, they resulted in little to no reduction.

There is lack of literature on the use of videotaped information during the pediatric oncology initial family disclosure meeting. The purpose of this study was to deliver an informative DVD, highlighting information on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), to parents of children with newly diagnosed ALL and to assess if the DVD provided increased levels of satisfaction and decreased levels of anxiety in parents around the time of diagnosis. We surveyed 24 parents of children on active treatment for ALL, diagnosed between the ages of 1 and 18 years from 2008 to 2016 at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Parents were provided a survey questionnaire assessing levels of satisfaction with information communicated by the healthcare team and anxiety following verbal disclosure and were asked to report satisfaction and anxiety levels immediately following viewing the DVD intervention. Twenty-three/24 (95.8%) parents surveyed reported seeking information from additional resources after disclosure. Of the 24 parents who watched the DVD, 12 (50.0%) watched it once, while 12 (50.0%) watched it twice or more. All parents were satisfied with DVD information, and there was a significant decrease in anxiety after viewing (P = 0.03). All 24 parents felt that the DVD was a useful educational tool. Videotaped information after verbal disclosure is an effective educational resource and is associated with reduced anxiety among parents of children with ALL.","['Di Giuseppe, Giancarlo', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Abla, Oussama', 'Punnett, Angela']","['Di Giuseppe G', 'Pole JD', 'Abla O', 'Punnett A']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada. angela.punnett@sickkids.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Cancer Educ,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,8610343,,,2019/02/11 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2019/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13187-019-1485-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s13187-019-1485-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Educ. 2020 Jun;35(3):479-484. doi: 10.1007/s13187-019-1485-2.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer diagnosis', '*Childhood leukemia', '*Videotaped information']",,,,,,20210125,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anxiety/*prevention & control', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Information Dissemination/*methods', 'Male', 'Parents/*education/*psychology', 'Patient Care Team', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Videotape Recording/*statistics & numerical data']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether Fli-1 regulates caspase-1 expression levels in vitro and how Fli-1 regulates caspase-1 remain unknown. Our present work further demonstrated that overexpressed Fli-1 significantly increased caspase-1 and IL-18 expression levels in cultured mouse lung pericytes. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have been found to induce cell pyroptosis through transferring LPS intracellularly. Using OMVs to induce an in vitro model of pyroptosis, we observed that OMVs significantly increased protein levels of Fli-1 in mouse lung pericytes. Furthermore, knockdown of Fli-1 by siRNA blocked OMVs-induced caspase-1, caspase-11 and IL-18 expression levels. As caspase-1 was predicted as a potential target of Fli-1, we cloned murine caspase-1 promoter into a luciferase construct. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Fli-1 regulates caspase-1 expression by directly binding to its promoter regions measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and luciferase reporter system. In summary, our findings demonstrated a novel role and mechanism of Fli-1 in regulating caspase-1 expression in lung pericytes.","['Li, Pengfei', 'Goodwin, Andrew J', 'Cook, James A', 'Halushka, Perry V', 'Zhang, Xian K', 'Fan, Hongkuan']","['Li P', 'Goodwin AJ', 'Cook JA', 'Halushka PV', 'Zhang XK', 'Fan H']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States; Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States.', 'Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States; Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States.

Cancer pathogenesis has been associated with genetic alterations that may lead to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently deleted or inactivated in various tumors. A recently discovered variant of PTEN, PTEN-Long (PTEN-L), results from an alternative translation initiation site located upstream of the canonic AUG and generates a protein of 576 amino acids instead the expected protein of 403 amino acids. A 16bp perfect palindromic motif centered on the PTEN-L CUG(513) start codon is required for translation initiation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of PTEN-L gene rs12573787 is located on the first exon respect to the CUG initiation site. In this case-control study we evaluated the association of genetic variants in PTEN-L with CML risk and therapy response in the Argentine population. The allele A of SNP rs12573787 was found to be associated with CML risk OR (95% CI) 1.71 (1.11-2.63) p=0.016, which resulted consistent by multivariate analysis adjusted by gender and age. According to previous evidence that CML is more frequent in males, we found that the genetic risk of CML was confined to this gender. Unexpectedly, we also found this association confined to CML patients older than 45years old.

METHODS: Total of 483 patients with hematologic malignancies admitted in our hospital from January 2013 to December 2016 were enrolled in this study, and 612 PICC catheterization were conducted. The median time of catheterization was 101 d (48 approximately 184 d) . The incidence rates of CRBSI and CRTC were observed, and the CRBSI and CRTC associated variables were also analyzed. RESULTS: There were 47 cases of CRBSI (7.7%), and the incidence was 0.59 per thousand PICC days, and there were 16 cases of CRTC (2.6%), with the incidence of 0.20 per thousand PICC days. Meanwhile, no other related serious complications found. The Cox regression analysis of CRBSI and CRTC-associated variables showed that the acute leukemia was significantly related with a higher incidence of CRBSI as compared with the other type of disease, however, which was not significantly related with the CRTC.

METHOD: To evaluate the T cell subtypes by flow cytometry on the CML patients of our center who received the treatment with dasatinib (n=10), nilotinib (n=26) or imatinib (n=44) for more than 3 months, and to analyze and correlate these data with the clinical remission situations and prognosis. RESULTS: 80.0% of the patients in dasatinib group, 16.6% of the patients in nilotinib group and 27.5% of the patients in imatinib group respectively had a Th1 proportion in the peripheral blood (Th1/CD4(+) T) above the upper limit of normal. More specifically, the Th1 proportion in dasatinib group (30.86%+/-9.75%) was significantly higher than that in nilotinib group(17.37%+/-9.35%) (P<0.001) and that in imatinib group (20.79%+/-9.01%) (P<0.001). Among the 3 groups, both the CD8(+) T cell proportion (CD8(+) T/Lymphocyte) and the Th2 proportion (Th2/CD4(+) T) in the peripheral blood did not show a statistically significant difference. The Treg proportion (Treg/CD4(+) T) in dasatinib group (1.31%+/-0.10%) was significantly lower than that in nilotinib group (2.65%+/-0.97%) (P<0.001) and that in imatinib group(2.99%+/-1.40%) (P<0.001).Among all the CML patients analyzed, for CML patients who had a Th1 proportion above the upper limit of normal(25.8%) (n=28), 84.62% of these patients obtained CCyR (complete cytogenetic response), 71.43% of these patients obtained MMR (major molecular response), 71.43% of these patients obtained MR4.5; for CML patients who had the Th1 proportion in the normal range(11.8%-25.8%) (n=45), 90.7% of these patients obtained CCyR, 75.56% of these patients obtained MMR, and 75.56% of these patients obtained MR4.5; for CML patients who had the Th1 proportion below the lower limit of normal (11.8%) (n=21), 57.14% of these patients obtained CCyR, 47.62% of these patients obtained MMR, and 47.62% of these patients obtained MR4.5. The above-mentioned data shows that the patients in high Th1 group and the normal Th1 group obtained the higher remission rate as well as the deeper remission level. CONCLUSION: This study shows that during the CML treatment with TKIs, the increased or normal Th1 proportion indicates a bigger chance for CCyR, MMR, and MR4.5. Dasatinib may significantly increase the level of Th1 while decrease the level of Treg in the patients, as compared with nilotinib and imatinib.","['Dai, Jing-Ying', 'Yang, Xi', 'Wei, Qing', 'Li, Hui', 'Huang, Xiao-Bing', 'Wang, Xiao-Dong']","['Dai JY', 'Yang X', 'Wei Q', 'Li H', 'Huang XB', 'Wang XD']","[""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Sichuan Translational Medicine Research Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Sichuan Translational Medicine Research Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Sichuan Translational Medicine Research Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Sichuan Translational Medicine Research Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Sichuan Translational Medicine Research Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China.Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Sichuan Translational Medicine Research Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.E-mail: wangxiaodong@med.uestc.edu.cn.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,2019/02/11 06:00,2019/04/05 06:00,['2019/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)01-0025-08 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2019.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Feb;27(1):25-32. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2019.01.005.,,,,,,,,20190404,IM,"['Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Th1 Cells', 'Treatment Outcome']","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H. Li (PCT3) for 24, 48, and 72 h, and MTT assay was employed to determine the cells proliferation. Meanwhile, the apoptosis of K562, HL-60, KG-1 and HT-93 cells were detected by flow cytometry after PCT3 (Control, 4 mug/ml, 8 mug/ml) treated for 24 h and the Western blot was performed to detect the expression of PARP,Caspase-3, MCL-1, BAX, BCL-2, P53, and P27. GAPDH was used as an internal loading control. RESULTS: MTT assay showed that Paris forrestii (Takht.) H. Li (PCT3) significantly inhibited the proliferation of HL-60, K562, KG-1 and HT-93 cells in concentration and time-dependent manners. Compared with the control group, the leukemia cell viabilities were significantly suppressed (r =0.9436; r =0.8623; r =0.9922; r =0.8918). Paris forrestii (Takht.) H. Li (PCT3) induced apoptosis of leukemia cells in a concentration dependent manner, compared with the control group (P0.05 or P0.01). Western blot revealed that PARP, a major enzyme in DNA damage repair, and Caspase-3 another one of the major executive apoptotic enzymes were cleaved in cell lines examined, and this cleavage was concentration dependent. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as MCL-1 and BCL-2 were down regulated by Paris forrestii (Takht.) H. Li (PCT3), and Pro-apoptotic protein BAX was upregulated. And the protein of tumor suppressor gene P53 and its downstream signaling protein P27 increased. CONCLUSION: Paris forrestii (Takht.) H.

Dami (megakaryocyte line) cell maturation was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. CD226 was silenced by infection with a CD226-specific shRNA lentiviral vector. The mRNA level of CD226 was detected by qRT-PCR. The expressions of Dami cells surface CD226, MK specific markers CD41 and CD62P, and DNA ploidy in Dami cells and CD226 knockdown (KD) cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. The effect of CD226 on the expression of megakaryocyte-associated transcription factors was measured by western blot and confocal analysis. Transfection with CD226 shRNA lentivirus dramatically decreased the level of CD226 and expression of CD62 P in Dami cells. Silencing of CD226 caused morphological changes and differentiation retardation in low-ploidy MK.

However, current systems are not sufficiently sensitive at detecting and quantifying TEC colonies from the adult thymus. Here, we optimized the culture condition to detect visible colonies from adult TECs by modifying our previous culture methods. Epidermal growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor significantly enhanced the colony-forming efficiency of total TECs from embryo as well as adult mice when added 3days after plating. Importantly, characteristics of the TEC colonies formed by the improved condition were almost equivalent to those by the original culture condition with respect to self-renewal and the expression of cell surface markers and intracellular keratins. Furthermore, the colonies derived from total TECs showed immature phenotypes and generated both mature cortical TECs and medullary TECs upon implantation in vivo. These data indicate a more sensitive clonogenic assay system for TECs was established and suggest the improved culture condition supports the colony formation of stem/progenitor cells for cTECs, mTECs and/or bipotent TECs.","['Sekai, Miho', 'Wang, Jianwei', 'Minato, Nagahiro', 'Hamazaki, Yoko']","['Sekai M', 'Wang J', 'Minato N', 'Hamazaki Y']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Laboratory of Immunobiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Laboratory of Immunobiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan; Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Laboratory of Immunobiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.

Simple but efficient quantification of FLT3 protein levels on the leukemic cell surface using flow cytometry had been developed for rapid determination of FLT3 on intact cell surface. METHODS: Quantitation protocol for FLT3 biomarker in clinical samples was developed and validated. Cell model selection for calibration curve construction was identified and evaluated. Selected antibody concentrations, cell density, and incubation time were evaluated for most appropriate conditions. Comparison of the developed FLT3 determination protocol with the conventional Western blot analysis was performed. RESULTS: EoL-1 cell line was selected for using as positive control cells. Calibration curve (20%-120% of FLT3 positive cells) and quality control (QC) levels were constructed and evaluated. The results demonstrated good linearity (r(2) > 0.99). The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy, expressed as the coefficient of variation (%CV) and % recovery, were <20% and fell in 80%-120% in all cases. When compared with Western blotting results, FLT3 protein expression levels in leukemia patient's bone marrow samples were demonstrated in the same trend. CONCLUSIONS: The effective, reliable, rapid, and economical analytical technique using the developed flow cytometric method was demonstrated for FLT3 protein determination on leukemic cell surface. This method provided a practical analysis of FLT-3 biomarker levels which is valuable for physician decision in acute leukemia treatment.","['Ampasavate, Chadarat', 'Jutapakdee, Wasimon', 'Phongpradist, Rungsinee', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Tantiworawit, Adisak', 'Charoenkwan, Pimlak', 'Chinwong, Dujrudee', 'Anuchapreeda, Songyot']","['Ampasavate C', 'Jutapakdee W', 'Phongpradist R', 'Tima S', 'Tantiworawit A', 'Charoenkwan P', 'Chinwong D', 'Anuchapreeda S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center for Research and Development of Natural Products for Health, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center for Research and Development of Natural Products for Health, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190208,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,PMC6528579,,2019/02/10 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/02/10 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22859 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2019 May;33(4):e22859. doi: 10.1002/jcla.22859.

The proportion of less-differentiated T cells within the transfused product is linked to enhanced in vivo CART cell expansion and long-term persistence. The clinically approved PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib is well established in the treatment of B cell malignancies. Besides B cell receptor pathway inhibition, idelalisib can modulate T cell differentiation and function. Here, detailed longitudinal analysis of idelalisib-induced effects on T cell phenotype and function was performed during CART cell production. A third generation CD19.CAR.CD28.CD137zeta CAR vector system was used. CART cells were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors (HDs) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Idelalisib-based CART cell generation resulted in an enrichment of less-differentiated naive-like T cells (CD45RA+CCR7+), decreased expression of the exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3, as well as upregulation of the lymph node homing marker CD62L. Idelalisib increased transduction efficiency, but did not impair viability and cell expansion. Strikingly, CD4:CD8 ratios that were altered in CART cells from CLL patients were approximated to ratios in HDs by idelalisib. Furthermore, in vivo efficacy of idelalisib-treated CART cells was validated in a xenograft mouse model. Intracellular TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma production decreased in presence of idelalisib. This effect was reversible after resting CART cells without idelalisib. In summary, PI3Kdelta inhibition with idelalisib can improve CART cell products, particularly when derived from CLL patients. Further studies with idelalisib-based CART cell generation protocols are warranted.","['Stock, Sophia', 'Ubelhart, Rudolf', 'Schubert, Maria-Luisa', 'Fan, Fuli', 'He, Bailin', 'Hoffmann, Jean-Marc', 'Wang, Lei', 'Wang, Sanmei', 'Gong, Wenjie', 'Neuber, Brigitte', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss, Angela', 'Gern, Ulrike', 'Christ, Christiane', 'Hexel, Monika', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Schmidt, Patrick', 'Krauss, Jurgen', 'Jager, Dirk', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Sellner, Leopold']","['Stock S', 'Ubelhart R', 'Schubert ML', 'Fan F', 'He B', 'Hoffmann JM', 'Wang L', 'Wang S', 'Gong W', 'Neuber B', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss A', 'Gern U', 'Christ C', 'Hexel M', 'Schmitt A', 'Schmidt P', 'Krauss J', 'Jager D', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Dreger P', 'Schmitt M', 'Sellner L']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit ""Applied Tumor-Immunity"", German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190228,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,,2019/02/10 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/02/10 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32201 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Sep 1;145(5):1312-1324. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32201.

We used United States Environmental Protection Agency National Ambient Toxics Assessment (NATA) estimates of low-level ambient benzene to examine potential associations for the general public between benzene exposure and risk of hematologic cancers. Exposure was estimated by linking participants' residential address to the NATA benzene estimates for that census tract. Among 115,996 American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition cohort participants (52,554 men, 63,442 women), 2,595 were diagnosed with incident hematologic cancer between 1997 and 2013. Extended Cox regression modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among all participants, ambient benzene was positively associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.33 per mug/m(3) ) and T-cell lymphoma (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.53 per mug/m(3) ). Among men, ambient benzene was also positively associated with any hematologic malignancy (HR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15 per mug/m(3) ) and follicular lymphoma (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.09-1.50 per mug/m(3) ). No significant associations were observed for women only, but associations were suggestive for MDS and T-cell lymphoma. It is possible that the NATA ambient benzene estimates are a better proxy for benzene exposure for men than women in this cohort. The results of this study support an association between ambient benzene and risk of hematologic malignancies, particularly MDS, T-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. More research in large scale or pooled studies is needed to further explore these associations.","['Teras, Lauren R', 'Diver, W Ryan', 'Deubler, Emily L', 'Krewski, Daniel', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Switchenko, Jeffrey M', 'Gapstur, Susan M']","['Teras LR', 'Diver WR', 'Deubler EL', 'Krewski D', 'Flowers CR', 'Switchenko JM', 'Gapstur SM']","['Epidemiology Research Group, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.', 'Epidemiology Research Group, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.', 'Epidemiology Research Group, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.', 'McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'School of Epidemiology, Public Health and Disease Prevention, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Epidemiology Research Group, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20190227,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,,2019/02/10 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/02/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32202 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Nov 15;145(10):2647-2660. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32202.

Keeping its advantages in mind, we aimed to study the effects of different activating agents on embryo production and its quality and gene expression. In the present study, 1348 immature oocytes recovered were parthenogenetically developed to embryos. Usable-quality immature oocytes were collected by puncturing the surface follicles and matured in in vitro maturation (IVM) medium for 27 h in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 38.5 degrees C. The matured oocytes were parthenogenetically activated by exposure to 5 muM calcium ionophore for 5 min or 7% ethanol for 7 min sequentially followed by 4 h incubation in 2 mM 6-DMAP and then in vitro cultured (IVC) in RVCL/G-2 medium for 8 days. Matured oocytes were activated by calcium ionophore, the cleavage rate observed was 76.67 +/- 3.47%, and further they developed into 4-cell, 8-16-cell, morula, blastocyst, and hatched blastocyst with 85.30 +/- 1.57%, 70.60 +/- 2.00%, 45.05 +/- 2.66%, 22.89 +/- 2.40%, and 5.70 +/- 1.97%, respectively. Whereas ethanol-activated oocytes showed cleavage rate of 87.60 +/- 1.70% and further culture developed into 4-cell, 8-16 cell, morula, blastocyst, and hatched blastocyst with 86.14 +/- 1.03%, 71.56 +/- 2.21%, 40.90 +/- 2.45%, 19.02 +/- 1.26%, and 2.22 +/- 0.38%, respectively. Blastocyst developed from calcium ionophore-activated oocytes showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher total cell number (282.25 +/- 27.02 vs 206.00 +/- 40.46) and a lower apoptotic index (2.42 +/- 0.46 vs 4.07 +/- 1.44) than blastocyst developed from ethanol-activated oocytes. The relative expression of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2, BCL2A1, MCL) at different stages of embryos produced by either calcium ionophore or ethanol activation was found to be increased in earlier stages and decreased in later stages of embryonic development. Similarly, when these embryos were subjected to pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, BAD, BAK), expression was found to be slightly higher in blastocysts than other stages. This study shows that calcium ionophore-activated blastocysts were developmentally more competent than the ethanol-activated blastocysts.","['Dua, Diksha', 'Nagoorvali, D', 'Chauhan, M S', 'Palta, P', 'Mathur, P', 'Singh, M K']","['Dua D', 'Nagoorvali D', 'Chauhan MS', 'Palta P', 'Mathur P', 'Singh MK']","['Animal Biotechnology Centre, ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, 132001, India.', 'Animal Biotechnology Centre, ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, 132001, India.', 'ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Goats, Makhdum, Mathura, 281122, India.', 'Animal Biotechnology Centre, ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, 132001, India.', 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Noida, 201303, India.', 'Animal Biotechnology Centre, ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, 132001, India. drmanojvet@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190208,Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

MDSCs produce S100A9, which mediates premature death of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint impairs immune responses by inducing T-cell exhaustion and apoptosis, but its role in MDS is uncharacterized. Here we report an increased expression of PD-1 on HSPCs and PD-L1 on MDSCs in MDS versus healthy donors, and that this checkpoint is also activated in S100A9 transgenic (S100A9Tg) mice, and by treatment of BM mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) with S100A9. Further, MDS BM-MNC treated with recombinant PD-L1 underwent cell death, suggesting that the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction contributes to HSPC death in MDS. In accordance with this notion, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade restores effective hematopoiesis and improves colony-forming capacity in BM-MNC from MDS patients. Similar findings were observed in aged S100A9Tg mice. Finally, we demonstrate that c-Myc is required for S100A9-induced upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1, and that treatment of MDS HSPCs with anti-PD-1 antibody suppresses the expression of Myc target genes and increases the expression of hematopoietic pathway genes. We conclude anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 blocking strategies offer therapeutic promise in MDS in restoring effective hematopoiesis.","['Cheng, Pinyang', 'Eksioglu, Erika A', 'Chen, Xianghong', 'Kandell, Wendy', 'Le Trinh, Thu', 'Cen, Ling', 'Qi, Jin', 'Sallman, David A', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Tu, Nhan', 'Adams, William A', 'Zhang, Chunze', 'Liu, Jinhong', 'Cleveland, John L', 'List, Alan F', 'Wei, Sheng']","['Cheng P', 'Eksioglu EA', 'Chen X', 'Kandell W', 'Le Trinh T', 'Cen L', 'Qi J', 'Sallman DA', 'Zhang Y', 'Tu N', 'Adams WA', 'Zhang C', 'Liu J', 'Cleveland JL', 'List AF', 'Wei S']","['Department of Immunology, H.

We evaluated the prognostic value of AL staging among 413 patients initiated with second-line therapy between 2000 and 2015. Both the Revised Mayo 2012 and the European revision of Mayo 2004 staging systems were used. The median time from initial treatment to second-line therapy was 11.7 months. The first-line therapy was autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in 179 (43%) patients and non-ASCT therapies in 234 patients. Median survival from the institution of second-line therapy was 61 months. Both the Mayo 2004 and 2012 staging systems were of prognostic benefit at second-line therapy with respective risk ratios of 2.78 (95% CI: 2.15, 3.58) and 3.03 (95% CI: 2.33, 3.93) for patients with > stage 2 disease. On multivariate analysis, the predictive value of staging at second-line therapy was independent of stage at diagnosis and prior ASCT as first-line therapy. This study indicates that the Mayo staging systems work well at second-line therapy. Consequently, it is suitable for the stratification of patients in trials for relapsed, refractory AL amyloidosis.","['Hwa, Yi L', 'Gertz, Morie A', 'Kumar, Shaji K', 'Lacy, Martha Q', 'Buadi, Francis K', 'Dingli, David', 'Kapoor, Prashant', 'Zeldenrust, Steve R', 'Leung, Nelson', 'Hayman, Susanne R', 'Gonsalves, Wilson I', 'Kourelis, Taxiarchis V', 'Warsame, Rahma', 'Go, Ronald S', 'Muchtar, Eli', 'Hobbs, Miriam A', 'Fonder, Amie L', 'Russell, Stephen', 'Kyle, Robert A', 'Rajkumar, S Vincent', 'Dispenzieri, Angela']","['Hwa YL', 'Gertz MA', 'Kumar SK', 'Lacy MQ', 'Buadi FK', 'Dingli D', 'Kapoor P', 'Zeldenrust SR', 'Leung N', 'Hayman SR', 'Gonsalves WI', 'Kourelis TV', 'Warsame R', 'Go RS', 'Muchtar E', 'Hobbs MA', 'Fonder AL', 'Russell S', 'Kyle RA', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Dispenzieri A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Divsion of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been recognized as crucial immunosuppressive cells in various pathologic settings. Here, we investigated whether the unique functional properties of MDSCs could be harnessed to control allo-HSCT-associated GVHD. Using multiple murine GVHD/GVL models including both MHC-mismatched and miHA-mismatched, we demonstrated that treatment with CD115+ MDSCs efficiently suppressed GVHD but did not significantly impair graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity, leading to 80 and 67% protection in treated mice in GVHD and GVL models, respectively. The mechanism for this dissociation of GVHD from GVL, specifically the emergence of donor-derived NKG2D(+) CD8 T cells with a memory phenotype in MDSC-treated recipient mice, was identified. NKG2D expression on donor T cells was required for eradication of allogeneic lymphoma cells. Furthermore, long-term surviving MDSC recipients that exhibited cytolytic activities against allogeneic leukemia cells had a significantly increased percentage of T regulatory cells and, more importantly, NKG2D(+) CD8 T cells. These findings indicate that MDSCs can be used as a novel cell-based therapy to suppress GVHD while maintaining GVL activities through selective induction of NKG2D(+) CD8 memory T cells.","['Zhang, Jilu', 'Chen, Hui-Ming', 'Ma, Ge', 'Zhou, Zuping', 'Raulet, David', 'Rivera, Andreana L', 'Chen, Shu-Hsia', 'Pan, Ping-Ying']","['Zhang J', 'Chen HM', 'Ma G', 'Zhou Z', 'Raulet D', 'Rivera AL', 'Chen SH', 'Pan PY']","['Center for Immunotherapy Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, 6670 Bertner Avenue, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Immunotherapy Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, 6670 Bertner Avenue, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1425 Madison Avenue, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1425 Madison Avenue, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Cancer Research Laboratory, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.', 'Research Pathology Core, Houston Methodist Hospital, 6565 Fannin Street, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Immunotherapy Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, 6670 Bertner Avenue, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. schen3@houstonmethodist.org.', 'Center for Immunotherapy Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, 6670 Bertner Avenue, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. ppan@houstonmethodist.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190208,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6687551,,2019/02/10 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/02/10 06:00'],"['2018/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0394-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0394-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):2078-2089. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0394-z.

The most common unbalanced abnormalities found in CK result in loss of material from the 5q, 7q, and/or 17p chromosome arms. The presence of 5q, 7q, and/or 17p abnormalities denotes typical CK and their absence denotes atypical CK. Since molecular features of CK-AML are not well characterized, we investigated mutational status of 81 leukemia/cancer-associated genes in 160 clinically well-characterized patients. They included 136 patients with >/= 3 exclusively unbalanced chromosome abnormalities, 96 of whom had a typical CK and 40 atypical CK, and 24 patients with >/= 1 balanced abnormality in addition to >/= 2 unbalanced ones. Patients with atypical CK-AML differed from those with typical CK-AML: they carried TP53 mutations less often (P < 0.001) and more often PHF6 (P = 0.008), FLT3-TKD (P = 0.02), MED12 (P = 0.02), and NPM1 (P = 0.02) mutations. They were younger (P = 0.007), had higher WBC (P = 0.001) and percentages of marrow (P < 0.001) and blood (P = 0.006) blasts, higher complete remission rates (P = 0.02), and longer overall survival (P < 0.001), thus indicating that atypical and typical CK-AMLs constitute distinct disease subtypes.

One such attractive target is the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE); we therefore evaluated the activity of TAK-243, a novel and specific UAE inhibitor. TAK-243 potently suppressed myeloma cell line growth, induced apoptosis, and activated caspases while decreasing the abundance of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. This was accompanied by stabilization of many short-lived proteins, including p53, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), and c-MYC, and activation of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) arms of the ER stress response pathway, as well as oxidative stress. UAE inhibition showed comparable activity against otherwise isogenic cell lines with wild-type (WT) or deleted p53 despite induction of TP53 signaling in WT cells. Notably, TAK-243 overcame resistance to conventional drugs and novel agents in cell-line models, including bortezomib and carfilzomib resistance, and showed activity against primary cells from relapsed/refractory myeloma patients. In addition, TAK-243 showed strong synergy with a number of antimyeloma agents, including doxorubicin, melphalan, and panobinostat as measured by low combination indices. Finally, TAK-243 was active against a number of in vivo myeloma models in association with activation of ER stress. Taken together, the data support the conclusion that UAE inhibition could be an attractive strategy to move forward to the clinic for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.","['Zhuang, Junling', 'Shirazi, Fazal', 'Singh, Ram Kumar', 'Kuiatse, Isere', 'Wang, Hua', 'Lee, Hans C', 'Berkova, Zuzana', 'Berger, Allison', 'Hyer, Marc', 'Chattopadhyay, Nibedita', 'Syed, Sakeena', 'Shi, Judy Qiuju', 'Yu, Jie', 'Shinde, Vaishali', 'Tirrell, Stephen', 'Jones, Richard Julian', 'Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Davis, R Eric', 'Orlowski, Robert Z']","['Zhuang J', 'Shirazi F', 'Singh RK', 'Kuiatse I', 'Wang H', 'Lee HC', 'Berkova Z', 'Berger A', 'Hyer M', 'Chattopadhyay N', 'Syed S', 'Shi JQ', 'Yu J', 'Shinde V', 'Tirrell S', 'Jones RJ', 'Wang Z', 'Davis RE', 'Orlowski RZ']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA; and.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190208,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6450433,,2019/02/10 06:00,2019/12/28 06:00,['2019/02/10 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42650-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-06-859686 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Apr 4;133(14):1572-1584. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-06-859686.

These factors have spurred interest in combination treatments. Unlike with chemotherapy, CD20-directed antibody therapy has not improved the outcome of BTKi treatment. Whereas CD20 antigen density on CLL cells decreases during ibrutinib treatment, the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and its receptor (BAFF-R) remain elevated. Furthermore, BAFF signaling via noncanonical NF-kappaB remains elevated with BTKi treatment. Blocking BAFF interaction with BAFF-R by using VAY-736, a humanized defucosylated engineered antibody directed against BAFF-R, antagonized BAFF-mediated apoptosis protection and signaling at the population and single-cell levels in CLL cells. Furthermore, VAY-736 showed superior antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity compared with CD20- and CD52-directed antibodies used in CLL. VAY-736 exhibited in vivo activity as a monotherapy and, when combined with ibrutinib, produced prolonged survival compared with either therapy alone. The in vivo activity of VAY-736 is dependent upon immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated activation of effector cells as shown by using an ITAM-deficient mouse model. Collectively, our findings support targeting the BAFF signaling pathway with VAY-736 to more effectively treat CLL as a single agent and in combination with ibrutinib.","['McWilliams, Emily M', 'Lucas, Christopher R', 'Chen, Timothy', 'Harrington, Bonnie K', 'Wasmuth, Ronni', 'Campbell, Amanda', 'Rogers, Kerry A', 'Cheney, Carolyn M', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Woyach, Jennifer', 'Carson, William E 3rd', 'Butchar, Jonathan', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Castro, Carlos E', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['McWilliams EM', 'Lucas CR', 'Chen T', 'Harrington BK', 'Wasmuth R', 'Campbell A', 'Rogers KA', 'Cheney CM', 'Mo X', 'Andritsos LA', 'Awan FT', 'Woyach J', 'Carson WE 3rd', 'Butchar J', 'Tridandapani S', 'Hertlein E', 'Castro CE', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, College of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, College of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary and Comparative Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, College of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Center for Biostatistics.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6373734,,2019/02/10 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/02/10 06:00'],"['2018/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018025684 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025684 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Feb 12;3(3):447-460. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018025684.,,,"['R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA159296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1813-9812'],,,20200203,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'ZN2GQ3II96 (ianalumab)']",,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

New treatment agents including obinutuzumab and ibrutinib have improved the progression-free survival in CLL, and data suggest a similar overall infection risk and a limited risk of opportunistic infections when compared to standard chemo-immunotherapy. Nevertheless, cases of opportunistic infections including non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) in CLL patients have recently been published. We present a case of a 74-year old man with extensive prior CLL treatment history, including most recently obinutuzumab. He developed an abscess of the psoas muscle and inguinal lymphadenopathy. An inguinal node biopsy specimen showed infection with Mycobacterium avium, confirmed by broad-spectrum mycobacterial PCR, M. avium-specific PCR, and mycobacterial culture. This case and our literature review suggest that physicians should be aware of opportunistic infections in patients with CLL. Diagnostic differentiation from CLL disease progression, Richter's transformation to aggressive lymphoma, and secondary malignancy relies on histological and appropriate microbiological studies from biopsy material of affected organs.

The chemotherapy induces fatigue and forces bed rest. These features strongly contribute to a general impairment of the physical efficiency. Oppositely, an increase of physical exercise can prevent or reduce this weakening. Few trials examined the efficacy of an exercise in onco-hematological inpatients, during their hospitalization. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the feasibility of an inter-hospital intervention and the beneficial role of a tailored exercise program in the maintenance of the physical function in onco-hematological inpatients. The study included 42 patients, which were allocated in two groups. In the intervention group (IG) a tailored exercise protocol during patient's hospitalization was administered. Exercise protocol was focused on development of strength, balance control, and flexibility; sessions were directly performed in the patient's hospital room everyday for 15 to 30 minutes. Exercise was supervised by an exercise specialist and driven by a multimedia support. Control group (CG) remained physically inactive for all period of hospitalization. To examine the interaction between the two situations (T0 and T1 ) and the two groups (IG and CG) for all dependent variables, a 2 x 2 within-subjects contrasts model analysis of variance was applied. Within groups analysis displayed significant differences in grip and leg strength and in static balance control (P < 0.05) with medium to very large effect size. Results from this investigation showed that a tailored exercise protocol administered to hospitalized onco-hematological patients was feasible and efficient to promote the maintenance of their physical function, improving clinical best practice including exercise to the traditional treatment. Moreover, the magnitude of the difference between the IG and the CG underlined the importance to invite and stimulate patients to workout to preserve the physical function, counteracting side effects of chemotherapy treatments with a concurrent reduction in bed rest syndrome.","['Duregon, Federica', 'Gobbo, Stefano', 'Bullo, Valentina', 'Roma, Enrico', 'Vendramin, Barbara', 'Bergamo, Manuele', 'Bocalini, Danilo Sales', 'Di Blasio, Andrea', 'Cugusi, Lucia', 'Neunhaeuserer, Daniel', 'Bergamin, Marco', 'Ermolao, Andrea']","['Duregon F', 'Gobbo S', 'Bullo V', 'Roma E', 'Vendramin B', 'Bergamo M', 'Bocalini DS', 'Di Blasio A', 'Cugusi L', 'Neunhaeuserer D', 'Bergamin M', 'Ermolao A']","['Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Sport and Exercise Medicine Division, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Laboratorio de Fisiologia e Bioquimica Experimental, Centro de Educacao Fisica e Deportos, Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo (UFES), Vitoria, Brazil.', ""Department of Medicine and Sciences of Aging, G. d'Annunzio, University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."", ""Department of Medical Sciences 'M.

There are also suggestions that the reported risk has been decreasing. We examine trends in the risk over time from all available studies. For 41 studies, we combine reported risks using inverse-variance weighting, drawing risk estimates from previous pooled analyses where possible for greater consistency. We examine the cumulative risk for studies published up to each successive calendar year for all studies and for various subsets, and test for a trend over the period. The cumulative relative risk has indeed declined, for our most rigorous analysis from a maximum 2.44 in 1997 to 1.58 in 2017, but not statistically significantly when tested as a linear trend. We find suggestions of higher risks in studies looking at higher exposures and in studies with better quality exposure assessment. We conclude that there is a decline in reported risk from the mid 1990s to now, which is unlikely to be solely explained by improving study quality but may be due to chance, and an elevated risk remains.","['Swanson, J', 'Kheifets, L', 'Vergara, X']","['Swanson J', 'Kheifets L', 'Vergara X']","['National Grid, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190208,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/07/17 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1361-6498/ab0586 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2019 Jun;39(2):470-488. doi: 10.1088/1361-6498/ab0586.

Among triazoles, compounds 4f, 4j and 4q exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against SB-ALL and NALM-6 with IC50 values in the range of approximately 1.64-5.66muM and approximately 1.14-3.7muM, respectively, compared with doxorubicin (IC50=0.167muM, SB-ALL). Compounds 4f, 4j and 4q were subjected to apoptosis assay after 48h treatment and these compounds induced apoptosis of NALM-6 cells via caspase 3/7 activation. Results revealed that compound 4q represents potential promising lead.","['Mamta', 'Aggarwal, Ranjana', 'Sadana, Rachna', 'Ilag, Jeziel', 'Sumran, Garima']","['Mamta', 'Aggarwal R', 'Sadana R', 'Ilag J', 'Sumran G']","['Department of Chemistry, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra 136119, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra 136119, India.

Following FDA approval of CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, CAR T cells are poised to enter mainstream oncology. Despite this success, a number of patients are unable to receive this therapy due to inadequate T cell numbers or rapid disease progression. Furthermore, lack of response to CAR T cell treatment is due in some cases to intrinsic autologous T cell defects and/or the inability of these cells to function optimally in a strongly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We describe recent efforts to overcome these limitations using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, with the goal of enhancing potency and increasing the availability of CAR-based therapies. We further discuss issues related to the efficiency/scalability of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in CAR T cells and safety considerations. By combining the tools of synthetic biology such as CARs and CRISPR/Cas9, we have an unprecedented opportunity to optimally program T cells and improve adoptive immunotherapy for most, if not all future patients.","['Salas-Mckee, January', 'Kong, Weimin', 'Gladney, Whitney L', 'Jadlowsky, Julie K', 'Plesa, Gabriela', 'Davis, Megan M', 'Fraietta, Joseph A']","['Salas-Mckee J', 'Kong W', 'Gladney WL', 'Jadlowsky JK', 'Plesa G', 'Davis MM', 'Fraietta JA']","['a Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Abramson Cancer Center , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'c Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'd Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, PA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190402,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,PMC6605860,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21645515.2019.1571893 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2019;15(5):1126-1132. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2019.1571893.

Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is a potential re-transplantation option. Total body irradiation (TBI) is often incorporated into the pre-salvage CBT conditioning regimen following PGF; however, patients experiencing PGF are not always amenable to TBI, and non-TBI regimens for salvage CBT should be established. Here, we report five patients with hematologic malignancies who received salvage CBT for PGF following a non-TBI regimen using fludarabine (Flu), melphalan (Mel), and low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). The median intervals between the failed allo-SCT and salvage CBT, as well as between the diagnosis of PGF and salvage CBT, were 37 days and 8 days, respectively. The median neutrophil recovery period was 21 days (range 18-21 days). Four of five patients achieved neutrophil engraftment following salvage CBT; all four exhibited sustained engraftment with complete donor chimerism. Three of the five patients were alive after a median follow-up time of 907 days (range 315-909 days) post-salvage CBT; two patients died of causes unrelated to recurrence. These data suggest that CBT following the non-TBI regimen described here is feasible in patients with PGF.","['Hoshino, Takumi', 'Takada, Satoru', 'Hatsumi, Nahoko', 'Sakura, Toru']","['Hoshino T', 'Takada S', 'Hatsumi N', 'Sakura T']","['Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Kamishinden-machi, 564-1, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-0821, Japan. takumihoshino4249@gmail.com.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Kamishinden-machi, 564-1, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-0821, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Kamishinden-machi, 564-1, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-0821, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Kamishinden-machi, 564-1, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-0821, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190208,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/02/09 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02610-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02610-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Apr;109(4):463-469. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02610-4.

Whether the influx organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) encoded by the gene SLC221A1 is implicated in the cellular uptake of imatinib is still controversial. Besides, imatinib ionization state may be modulated by the hypoxic acidic surrounding extracellular microenvironment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional contribution of OCTs and extracellular pH on imatinib cellular disposition. METHODS: We measured imatinib uptake in two different models of selective OCTs drug transporter expression (transfected Xenopus laevis oocytes and OCT-expressing HEK293 human cells), incubated at pH 7.4 and 6, using specific mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: Imatinib cellular uptake occurred independently of OCT1- OCT2- or OCT3-mediated drug transport at pH 7.4. Uptake of the OCTs substrate tetraethylammonium in oocytes remained intact at pH 6, while the accumulation of imatinib in oocytes was 10-fold lower than at pH 7.4, irrespectively of OCTs expressions. In OCT1- and OCT2-HEK cells at pH 6, imatinib accumulation was reduced by 2- 3-fold regardless of OCTs expressions. Since 99.5% of imatinib at pH6 is under the cationic form, the reduced cellular accumulation of imatinib at such pH may be explained by the lower amount of uncharged imatinib remaining for passive diffusion across cellular membrane. CONCLUSION: Imatinib is not a substrate of OCTs 1-3 while the environmental pH modulates cellular disposition of imatinib. The observation that a slightly acidic extracellular pH influences imatinib cellular accumulation is important, considering the low extracellular pH reported in the hematopoietic leukemia/ cancer cell microenvironment.","['Blanc Mettral, Jaures', 'Faller, Nicolas', 'Cruchon, Sandra', 'Sottas, Loic', 'Buclin, Thierry', 'Schild, Laurent', 'Choong, Eva', 'Nahimana, Aimable', 'Decosterd, Laurent A']","['Blanc Mettral J', 'Faller N', 'Cruchon S', 'Sottas L', 'Buclin T', 'Schild L', 'Choong E', 'Nahimana A', 'Decosterd LA']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Laboratories, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Research Laboratory of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Drug Metab Lett,Drug metabolism letters,101313587,,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['DML-EPUB-96484 [pii]', '10.2174/1872312813666190207150207 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Lett. 2019;13(2):102-110. doi: 10.2174/1872312813666190207150207.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Imatinib', '*MATE1', '*OCT1', '*OCT2', '*OCT3', '*acidic extracellular pH', '*cellular concentrations', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*influx organic cation transporters', '*mass spectrometry', '*multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1.']",,,,,,20200518,IM,"['Animals', 'Extracellular Space/*chemistry', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/metabolism', 'Oocytes', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 2/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Xenopus laevis']","['0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 2)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SLC22A2 protein, human)', '0 (solute carrier family 22 (organic cation transporter), member 3)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work demonstrates that sorted CAR natural killer (NK) cells have improved antileukemia activity compared to control NK cells that lack a functional CAR. However, in terms of viability, effectiveness, risk of side effects, and clinical practicality and applicability, an important question is whether gene-modified NK cell lines represent better CAR effector cells than primary human donor CAR-NK (CAR-dNK) cells. Comparison of the functional activities of sorted CAR-NK cells generated using the NK-92 cell line with those generated from primary human dNK cells demonstrated that CAR-NK-92 cells had stronger cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells compared to CAR-dNK cells. CAR-NK-92 and CAR-dNK cells had similar CD107a surface expression upon co-incubation with leukemia cells. However, CAR-NK-92 cells secreted higher granzyme A and interleukin-17A levels, while CAR-dNK cells secreted more tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and granulysin.

However, only few studies have tested the peripheral blood for MRD. METHODS: Here, we report the impact on survival of peripheral blood (PB) MRD assessment by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) at early time points of treatment in 125 B-ALL children, compared to Day 35 molecular bone marrow (BM) MRD. Patients were sampled for MFC one week postdiagnosis after a pre-phase of corticotherapy (Day 8), then after one week of chemotherapy (Day 15). The study enrolled 67 boys and 58 girls with a median follow-up of 52 months. Over the duration of the study, 20 patients relapsed and eight died. MFC was performed based on the leukemia-associated immunophenotype at diagnosis, using panels of 10 antibodies. RESULTS: Although, PB MFC-MRD had no prognostic impact at Day 8, Day 15 MRD negativity was associated with a significantly better 4 years DFS (91.6 +/- 3% vs. 67.6 +/- 9% P = 0.0013). Furthermore, while MFC and molecular data were concordant in most cases, patients with detectable PB MRD on Day 15, yet negative in BM on Day 35 had a significantly lower DFS (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the less invasive procedure of MFC-MRD assessment in PB can be informative for childhood ALL patients at the early point of Day 15 of the treatment schedule.

Although 0.1% was commonly used as a cutoff value, measurable MRD or MRD level below 0.1% has also been associated with prognostic significance and more sensitive thresholds (<0.1%) are required for improving AML prognosis prediction. In this study, 292 adult patients diagnosed with AML (non-M3) were enrolled, 36 kinds of LAIPs were identified, and the baseline expression levels in normal or regenerating bone marrows of each kind of LAIP were established, which ranged from <2.00 x 10(-5) to 5.71 x 10(-4) . The baseline level of each LAIP was considered as the individual threshold for MRD assessment. MRD statuses stratified by 0.1% and individual threshold were termed as 0.1%-MRD and individual-MRD, respectively. The patients of individual-MRD(neg) showed significantly better survival compared with those of 0.1%-MRD(neg) /individual-MRD(pos) or 0.1%-MRD(pos) . Multivariate analysis showed that when time points of complete remission, post the first and second consolidation courses, were considered, only individual-MRD post second consolidation presented independent prognostic value. Notably, in patients of cytogenetic/molecular low-risk (LR) or intermediate-risk (IR), the individual-MRD status could identify the patients with significantly different outcomes, while 0.1%-MRD status could not. Furthermore, among the patients of the LR or IR group which received chemotherapy only, those with individual-MRD(neg) status presented favorable survival, which was comparable with that of the patients accepted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This approach is useful in the selection of an ASCT strategy for clinical practice.","['Sui, Jing-Ni', 'Chen, Qiu-Sheng', 'Zhang, Yun-Xiang', 'Sheng, Yan', 'Wu, Jing', 'Li, Jun-Min', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Chen, Bing']","['Sui JN', 'Chen QS', 'Zhang YX', 'Sheng Y', 'Wu J', 'Li JM', 'Weng XQ', 'Chen B']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190221,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25431 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 May;94(5):528-538. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25431.

Deletions can be heterogeneous in size, generally encompassing the DLEU1 and DLEU2 genes (minimal deleted region), but at times also including the RB1 gene. The latter, larger type of deletions are associated with worse prognosis.Genomic instability is a characteristic of most cancers and it has been observed in CLL patients mainly associated with telomere shortening. Case presentation: Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of a CLL patient showed a chromosomal translocation t(12;13)(q15;q14), a mono-allelic 13q14 deletion encompassing both the DLEU and RB1 genes, and genomic instability manifested as chromosomal breaks, telomeric associations, binucleated cells, nucleoplasmic bridges, and micronucleated cells.In conclusion, our CLL patient showed genomic instability in conjunction with a 13q14 deletion of approximately 2.6 megabase pair involving the DLEU and RB1 genes, as well as other genes with potential for producing genomic instability due to haploinsufficiency.","['Nava-Rodriguez, Maria Paulina', 'Dominguez-Cruz, Martin Daniel', 'Aguilar-Lopez, Lilia Beatriz', 'Borjas-Gutierrez, Cesar', 'Magana-Torres, Maria Teresa', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Juan Ramon']","['Nava-Rodriguez MP', 'Dominguez-Cruz MD', 'Aguilar-Lopez LB', 'Borjas-Gutierrez C', 'Magana-Torres MT', 'Gonzalez-Garcia JR']","['1Doctorado en Genetica Humana, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud.

Skin manifestations are common in hematology ward patients and can result from infection, malignancy, or chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to identify the most common dermatological problems encountered in the adult hematology ward at King Abdullah Specialist Children Hospital (KASCH). Methods. This was retrospective chart review of 78 dermatology consultations based on electronic health records for all inpatients in hematology wards at KASCH between January 2016 and December 2017. Data were presented as mean +/- SD for continuous variables. Results. During the study period, a total of 1391 inpatients were referred to the dermatology department. A total of 403 (29.0%) referrals were from the internal medicine department and 78 (5.6%) were from the hematology department, six of which were rejected by the dermatology department. Almost all requests for referral were managed on the same or the next day with only two requests after 3 days. There were more female (n = 40; 51.3%) than male patients (n = 38; 48.7%) and the average age +/- SD was 40.7 +/- 19.8 years. Patients were diagnosed with a diverse range of hematological diseases. A total of 27 (35.1%) patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. Overall, 98 differential diagnoses were made by dermatologists with only 26 being confirmed by skin biopsy. Eight (30.8%) patients were diagnosed with graft versus host disease confirmed by skin biopsy. The diagnoses were changed in 12 cases after skin biopsy. Several types of dermatitis were diagnosed in hematology ward patients including stasis dermatitis and contact dermatitis. The source of infection was not specified in most cases and the infection was treated empirically. Conclusion. Various dermatological disorders and cutaneous manifestations are observed in hematology inpatients with morbilliform drug eruption and graft versus host disease being the most common.","['Alasmari, Amal Aboud', 'Hakeem, Anadel Hassan', 'Bin Saleh, Fatemah Saleh', 'Alsaigh, Shahad Yousef', 'Al Ajroush, Waleed', 'Layqah, Laila Ali', 'Baharoon, Salim Alawi']","['Alasmari AA', 'Hakeem AH', 'Bin Saleh FS', 'Alsaigh SY', 'Al Ajroush W', 'Layqah LA', 'Baharoon SA']","['College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Dermatology, King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), National Guard Health Affairs (NGHA), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Research Coordinator, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Intermediate Care Unit, King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), National Guard Health Affairs (NGHA), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190113,Egypt,Dermatol Res Pract,Dermatology research and practice,101312803,PMC6348816,,2019/02/09 06:00,2019/02/09 06:01,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/9891270 [doi]'],epublish,Dermatol Res Pract. 2019 Jan 13;2019:9891270. doi: 10.1155/2019/9891270. eCollection 2019.,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6943-2491'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her peripheral blood smear showed 5% to 8% blasts. Bone marrow aspirate showed an infiltration by ~30% blasts. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry confirmed relapse of DLBCL. Also, patient's poor response to therapeutic regimen for DLBCL prompted to consider second differential diagnosis of acute leukaemia. This case is a learning case, as it emphasizes the combined role of diagnostic ancillary techniques along with clinical judgments for management.

In LBCs, we demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 channel (TRPV2), reputed for its role in inflammatory processes, exhibited oncogenic activity associated with alteration of its molecular expression profile. TRPV2 was overexpressed in LBCs compared to normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, functional full length isoform and nonfunctional short form pore-less variant of TRPV2 protein were up-regulated and down-regulated respectively in LBCs. However, the opposite was found in PBMCs. TRPV2 silencing or pharmacological targeting by Tranilast (TL) or SKF96365 (SKF) triggered caspace-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. TL and SKF inhibited chemotactic peptide fMLP-induced response linked to TRPV2 Ca(2+) activity, and down-regulated expression of surface marker CD38 involved in leukemia and lung airway inflammation. Challenging lung airway epithelial cells (AECs) with LBCs decreased (by more than 50%) transepithelial resistance (TER) denoting barrier function alteration. Importantly, TL prevented such loss in TER. Therefore, TRPV2 merits further exploration as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for leukemia patients (with pulmonary inflammation) who might be suitable for a novel [adjuvant] therapeutic strategy based on TL.","['Siveen, Kodappully S', 'Prabhu, Kirti S', 'Parray, Aeijaz S', 'Merhi, Maysaloun', 'Arredouani, Abdelilah', 'Chikri, Mohamed', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Dermime, Said', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M', 'Steinhoff, Martin', 'Janahi, Ibrahim A', 'Azizi, Fouad']","['Siveen KS', 'Prabhu KS', 'Parray AS', 'Merhi M', 'Arredouani A', 'Chikri M', 'Uddin S', 'Dermime S', 'Mohammad RM', 'Steinhoff M', 'Janahi IA', 'Azizi F']","['Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research-Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Qatar Biomedical Research Institute, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Qatar Biomedical Research Institute, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research-Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Division of Pediatric Pulmonology Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. fazizi@hamad.qa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190207,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6367460,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/08/19 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-37469-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-37469-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Feb 7;9(1):1554. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-37469-8.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1886-6710', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5526-7496']",,,20200818,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Pneumonia/complications/*pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TRPV Cation Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'ortho-Aminobenzoates/pharmacology/therapeutic use']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV2 protein, human)', '0 (ortho-Aminobenzoates)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'HVF50SMY6E (tranilast)', 'I61V87164A (1-(2-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy)-4-methoxyphenylethyl)-1H-imidazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were used for leukemia models, whether their self-renewal and differentiation potentials influence the initiation and development of leukemia is largely unknown. In this study, the self-renewal and differentiation potentials in 2 distinct types of HSCs (HSC1 [CD150(+)CD41(-)CD34(-)Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells] and HSC2 [CD150(-)CD41(-)CD34(-)Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells]) and 3 distinct types of HPCs (HPC1 [CD150(+)CD41(+)CD34(-)Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells], HPC2 [CD150(+)CD41(+)CD34(+)Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells], and HPC3 [CD150(-)CD41(-)CD34(+)Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells]) were isolated from adult mouse bone marrow, and examined by competitive repopulation assay. Then, cells from each population were retrovirally transduced to initiate MLL-AF9 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and the intracellular domain of NOTCH-1 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). AML and T-ALL similarly developed from all HSC and HPC populations, suggesting multiple cellular origins of leukemia. New leukemic stem cells (LSCs) were also identified in these AML and T-ALL models. Notably, switching between immunophenotypical immature and mature LSCs was observed, suggesting that heterogeneous LSCs play a role in the expansion and maintenance of leukemia. Based on this mouse model study, we propose that acute leukemia arises from multiple cells of origin independent of the self-renewal and differentiation potentials in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and is amplified by LSC switchover.","['Dong, Fang', 'Bai, Haitao', 'Wang, Xiaofang', 'Zhang, Shanshan', 'Wang, Zhao', 'Xie, Miner', 'Zhang, Sen', 'Wang, Jinhong', 'Hao, Sha', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Ema, Hideo']","['Dong F', 'Bai H', 'Wang X', 'Zhang S', 'Wang Z', 'Xie M', 'Zhang S', 'Wang J', 'Hao S', 'Cheng T', 'Ema H']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; and.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6373745,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018022400 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018022400 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Feb 12;3(3):419-431. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018022400.,,,,,,,,20200319,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism']",,,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although effective, many patients relapse and become resistant to chemotherapy and GCs in particular. Why these patients relapse is not clear. We took a comprehensive, functional genomics approach to identify sources of GC resistance. A genome-wide shRNA screen identified the transcriptional coactivators EHMT2, EHMT1, and CBX3 as important contributors to GC-induced cell death. This complex selectively supports GC-induced expression of genes contributing to cell death. A metaanalysis of gene expression data from B-ALL patient specimens revealed that Aurora kinase B (AURKB), which restrains GC signaling by phosphorylating EHMT1-2, is overexpressed in relapsed B-ALL, suggesting it as a potential contributor to relapse. Inhibition of AURKB enhanced GC-induced expression of cell death genes, resulting in potentiation of GC cytotoxicity in cell lines and relapsed B-ALL patient samples. This function for AURKB is distinct from its canonical role in the cell cycle.

In vivo experiments using lymphoma xenografts models confirmed the in vitro data. The response of B-cell lymphoma lines to huB4-DGN462 was not correlated with CD19 expression, the presence of BCL2 or MYC translocations, TP53 inactivation or lymphoma histology.

Guadecitabine (SGI-110) is a novel subcutaneous hypomethylating agent which results in extended decitabine exposure. This multicenter phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of guadecitabine in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and low blast count acute myeloid leukemia patients refractory or relapsing after azacitidine. We included 56 patients with a median age of 75 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) 69-76]. Fifty-five patients received at least one cycle of guadecitabine (60 mg/m2/d subcutaneously days 1-5 per 28-day treatment cycles), with a median of 3 cycles (range, 0-27). Eight (14.3%) patients responded, including two complete responses; median response duration was 11.5 months. Having no or few identified somatic mutations was the only factor predicting response (P=0.035). None of the 11 patients with TP53 mutation responded. Median overall survival was 7.1 months, and 17.9 months in responders (3 of whom had overall survival >2 years). In multivariate analysis, IPSS-R (revised International Prognostic Scoring System) score other than very high (P=0.03) primary versus secondary azacitidine failure (P=0.01) and a high rate of demethylation in blood during the first cycle of treatment (P=0.03) were associated with longer survival. Thus, guadecitabine can be effective, sometimes yielding relatively prolonged survival, in a small proportion of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome/low blast count acute myeloid leukemia patients who failed azacitidine.

The FLAMSA-reduced intensity conditioning protocol (total body irradiation or treosulfan-based) has been described as an effective approach in patients with refractory leukemia undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. A modified protocol (without amsacrine) has also recently been used. We retrospectively analyzed the transplantation characteristics and outcomes of all consecutive patients between the years 2003 and 2017 (n=51) diagnosed with primary refractory AML who underwent transplantation at the University of Cologne and the Tel Aviv Medical Center. Median age was 54 years and median follow up was 37 months. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 13 (range, 8-19) and 13 (range, 7-30) days, respectively. None of the patients had primary graft failure. Incidences of grade 2-4 and grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), overall and moderate-severe chronic GvHD were 50% (95%CI: 41-67%), 12% (95%CI: 3-25%), 61% (95%CI: 47-72%), and 42% (95%CI: 34-51%), respectively. Anti-thymocyte globulin administration was associated with lower incidence of acute GvHD (HR: 0.327; P=0.02). Non-relapse mortality at three months and three years were 6% and 16%, respectively. Relapse incidences were 6% and 29%, respectively. Overall survival rates at three months, three and five years were 90%, 61%, and 53%, respectively. Chronic GvHD disease was associated with a decreased mortality rate (HR: 0.397; P=0.045). We conclude that sequential therapy in patients with primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia is safe and provides a remarkable anti-leukemic effect with durable survival and should be considered for every patient with primary refractory disease.","['Ram, Ron', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Amit, Odelia', 'Chemnitz, Jens Markus', 'Moshe, Yakir', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Avivi, Irit', 'Holtick, Udo']","['Ram R', 'Scheid C', 'Amit O', 'Chemnitz JM', 'Moshe Y', 'Hallek M', 'Wolf D', 'Avivi I', 'Holtick U']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Tel Aviv Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel ronram73@gmail.com.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Tel Aviv Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Tel Aviv Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'UKIM5, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Tel Aviv Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190207,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC6717567,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.203869 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.203869 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Sep;104(9):1798-1803. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.203869.

30733056,NLM,MEDLINE,20200618,2468-2667 (Electronic),4,3,2019 Mar,Emerging cancer trends among young adults in the USA: analysis of a population-based cancer registry.,e137-e147,S2468-2667(18)30267-6 [pii] 10.1016/S2468-2667(18)30267-6 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Cancer trends in young adults, often under 50 years, reflect recent changes in carcinogenic exposures, which could foreshadow the future overall disease burden. Previous studies reported an increase in early onset colorectal cancer, which could partly reflect the obesity epidemic. We examined age-specific contemporary incidence trends in the USA for 30 common cancers, including 12 obesity-related cancers. METHODS: We obtained incidence data for invasive cancers among people aged 25-84 years diagnosed from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, for 25 population-based state registries in the USA. All patients in the registry were included in the analyses. We considered the 20 most common cancer types and 12 obesity-related cancers (30 cancer types in total). We used age-period-cohort modelling to estimate average annual percentage change in incidence rates by 5-year age group (25-29 years to 80-84 years in 5-year increments) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) by birth cohort (10-year overlapping birth cohorts from 1910-19 to 1980-89 in 5-year increments). No exclusion criteria were applied after including all invasive cancer cases based on age group and diagnosis year. FINDINGS: From 1995 to 2014 there were 14 672 409 incident cases for 30 types of cancer. Incidence significantly increased for six of 12 obesity-related cancers (multiple myeloma, colorectal, uterine corpus, gallbladder, kidney, and pancreatic cancer) in young adults (25-49 years) with steeper rises in successively younger generations. Annual increases ranged from 1.44% (95% CI -0.60 to 3.53) for multiple myeloma to 6.23% (5.32-7.14) for kidney cancer at age 25-29 years, and ranged from 0.37% (0.03-0.72) for uterine corpus cancer to 2.95% (2.74-3.16) for kidney cancer at age 45-49 years. Compared with people born around 1950, IRRs for those born around 1985 ranged from 1.59 (95% CI 1.14-2.21) for multiple myeloma to 4.91 (4.27-5.65) for kidney cancer. Conversely, incidence in young adults increased in successively younger generations for only two cancers (gastric non-cardia cancer and leukaemia), and decreased for eight of the 18 additional cancers, including smoking and HIV infection-associated cancers. INTERPRETATION: The risk of developing an obesity-related cancer seems to be increasing in a stepwise manner in successively younger birth cohorts in the USA. Further studies are needed to elucidate exposures responsible for these emerging trends, including excess bodyweight and other risk factors.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected for measuring monocytic (M-) MDSCs (CD14(pos)HLA-DR(low/neg)) and early-stage (E-) MDSCs (Lin(neg)HLA-DR(neg)CD33(pos)CD11b(pos)) before and after ASCT. Clinical outcomes following ASCT differed according to the frequency of each MDSC phenotype. RESULTS: In the pre-ASCT analyses, lower M-MDSCs (<median) but not E-MDSCs were associated with a longer time to progression (TTP), whereas both MDSC phenotypes post-ASCT did not have a role in TTP. Both MDSC phenotypes pre-ASCT but not post-ASCT similarly suppressed in vitro autologous T and natural killer T cell proliferation. Importantly, pre-ASCT M-MDSCs more strongly inhibited the in vitro cytotoxic effect of melphalan compared with pre-ASCT E-MDSCs. Transcriptome analysis of each isolated MDSC subtype showed that expression of osteoclastic differentiation factors, particularly colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), was significantly increased in M-MDSCs pre-ASCT. Finally, blockade of CSF1R substantially recovered the melphalan-induced cytotoxicity reduced by pre-ASCT M-MDSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that pre-ASCT M-MDSCs are correlated with poor clinical outcomes after ASCT through reduced cytotoxicity of melphalan. We propose that targeting CSF1R on these cells may improve the results of ASCT in MM.","['Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Lim, Ji-Young', 'Kim, Tae Woo', 'Ryu, Da-Bin', 'Park, Sung Soo', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Lee, Seok', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Min, Chang-Ki']","['Lee SE', 'Lim JY', 'Kim TW', 'Ryu DB', 'Park SS', 'Jeon YW', 'Yoon JH', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee S', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min CK']","[""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpodae-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Korea. ckmin@catholic.ac.kr."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. ckmin@catholic.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190207,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,PMC6367772,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-018-0491-y [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-018-0491-y [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2019 Feb 7;7(1):35. doi: 10.1186/s40425-018-0491-y.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autologous stem cell transplantation', '*Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor', '*Multiple myeloma', '*Myeloid-derived suppressor cells']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1940-0392'],,,20200331,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/*therapy', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (CSF1R protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were divided into low and high group according to the cutoff value of 3.775 g/L obtained by analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of fibrinogen at diagnosis. Importantly, overall survival (OS) was markedly better in low fibrinogen group (p=.006) as well as disease-free survival (DFS) (p= .045). Furthermore, when patients achieved complete remission (CR), the median plasma fibrinogen levels were dramatically decreased in high fibrinogen group but increased in low fibrinogen group. In conclusion, our data suggest that initial plasma FBG levels can be used as an independent prognostic biomarker affecting OS and DFS, as well as a potential parameter reflecting the treatment outcome in patients with non-M3 AML.","['Dai, Kanchun', 'Zhang, Qianying', 'Li, Yingying', 'Wu, Luyi', 'Zhang, Shenghui', 'Yu, Kang']","['Dai K', 'Zhang Q', 'Li Y', 'Wu L', 'Zhang S', 'Yu K']","['a Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China.', ""b Department of Hematology/Oncology , Wenzhou People's Hospital , Wenzhou , China."", 'a Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China.', 'c Division of Clinical Research , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190208,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,2019/02/09 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1535116 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Jun;60(6):1503-1511. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1535116.

The 2nd patient was a 17-year-old female who presented with nasal obstruction and voice change for a month. DIAGNOSES: In the 1st patient, sinonasal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 2.9-cm sized, polypoid mass in the nasal cavity. In the 2nd patient, CT scans revealed a large enhancing nasopharyngeal mass involving adenoid and several small indeterminate lymph nodes at the neck. Cutaneous examination was unremarkable for either patient. Biopsy of these 2 masses and bone marrow biopsy were performed. Histologic diagnosis of the 2 cases was BPDCN. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients were treated with induction chemotherapy and received allogenic peripheral blood stem-cell transplant. OUTCOMES: No relapse was observed in the 2 patients for 14 and 11 months, respectively, after transplantation. Interestingly, they had no skin lesions at initial diagnosis or during the course of their illness. LESSONS: We 1st identified nasal cavity as an unusual site of BPDCN. BPDCN should be considered in differential diagnosis of blastic leukemia with an undifferentiated and ambiguous immunophenotype despite the absence of skin lesions.","['Lee, Seung Eun', 'Park, Ha Young', 'Kwon, Dohee', 'Jeon, Yoon Kyung', 'Kim, Wook Youn']","['Lee SE', 'Park HY', 'Kwon D', 'Jeon YK', 'Kim WY']","['Department of Pathology, Konkuk University Medical Center, Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Pathology, Busan Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University.', 'Department of Pathology, Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC6380774,,2019/02/09 06:00,2019/02/27 06:00,['2019/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000014344 [doi]', '00005792-201902080-00043 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Feb;98(6):e14344. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000014344.,,,,,,,,20190226,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Nasopharyngeal Diseases/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety-six trees were tested, 20 of cv. Williams, 4 of Abate Fetel, 30 of D'Anjou, and 38 of Packhamn, that showed no symptoms of PBCVd, plus four trees of cv. Red Bartlett that exhibited symptoms of bark pustules and rounded, scaly cankers varying from 2 to 6 cm in diameter on the stems. Purified dsRNA from leaves of 96 trees were analyzed by dot-blot hybridization with a specific probe for PBCVd (2). Of the plants tested, 18 were positive for PBCVd. Three of the positive dsRNAs, with a higher dot-blot signal, were analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide and a second denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A band, in the portion of viroids migration, was detected with ethidium bromide. The segment corresponding to the three bands was excised and electroeluted. Two-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using Moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse-transcriptase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI), retrotranscriptase, and PBCVd primers F-5'-GCGGGACAGAAGACGAGGCTCAGGCAGGAAGCAAC-3' and R-5'-TATAAAAGAAAAAAGCGCTTCGGCGGTGCTCGGG-3' (3). The product was legated into pUC 19 vector (Fermentas Inc., Glen Burnie, MD) and cloned following the manufacturer's instructions. Four clones were sequenced by the Unidad de Genomica, Instituto de Biotecnologia (Argentina) and the sequences were analyzed with the Lasergene Biocomputing Software for Windows (version 8.0.2; DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The four partial sequences of 296 nucleotides from the local sequences were identical to each other and had the highest nucleotide identity (99.7%) with the Spanish PBCVd (GenBank Accession No. D12823). The local sequence was submitted to GenBank (Accession No. HQ606079). PBCVd is a member of the genus Apscaviroid within the family Pospiviroidae. PBCVd is a 316-nucleotide viroid responsible for pear blister canker disease. It causes pustules, cankers, and/or bark symptoms on the pear indicators A 20 and Fieud 37, whereas infections on most commercial pear cultivars remain symptomless (1). These lesions are entry points for other pathogens to infect the plant. This research indicates the need to test pear propagation material in Argentina, since this is the primary way of spreading this pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PBCVd in Argentina. References: (1) J. Desvignes et al. Plant Dis. 83:419, 1999. (2) R. Flores et al. J. Gen. Virol. 72:1199, 1991. (3) C.

In this study, the mechanism of miR-486-5p in leukemia cells was pointed out and its possible target genes were analyzed for the purpose of providing new therapeutic strategies for treating leukemia patients. METHODS: MiRNA expression of Leukemia cells (K562, Kasumi-1, and THP-1) and primary leukocytes was detected by Real-time Quantitative polymerase chain reaction(qPCR). The activity of the cells was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Apoptotic cells were analyzed by a fl ow cytometer (FCM). Caspase-3 activation in leukemia cells was determined by Western blot. Targetscan 7.2 was used to predict the potential targets of miR-486-5p and further confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULT: miR-486-5p was significantly down-regulated in leukemia cells. The over-expression of miR-486-5p notably increased the apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in leukemia cells. There was a predicted interaction site for miR-486-5p in the FOXO1 3'-UTR. Furthermore, this study showed that FOXO1 was significantly up-regulated in leukemia cells, the growth of which was depressed by the up-regulation of miR-486-5p. CONCLUSION: miR-486-5p may inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells and induce apoptosis through targeting FOXO1.","['Liu, Hui', 'Ni, Zengfeng', 'Shi, Lili', 'Ma, Lijie', 'Zhao, Jianqiang']","['Liu H', 'Ni Z', 'Shi L', 'Ma L', 'Zhao J']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, China.

The structural protein Gag, found in all retroviruses, is a polyprotein comprising three major functional domains: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC). Previous studies have shown that both mature BLV MA and NC are able to bind to nucleic acids; however, the viral assembly process and packaging of viral genomic RNA requires full-length Gag to produce infectious particles. Compared to lentiviruses, little is known about the structure of the Gag polyprotein of deltaretroviruses. In this work, structural models of full-length BLV Gag and Gag lacking the MA domain were generated based on previous structural data of individual domains, homology modeling, and flexible fitting to SAXS data using molecular dynamics. The models were used in molecular dynamic simulations to determine the relative mobility of the protein backbone. Functional annealing assays revealed the role of MA in the nucleic acid chaperone activity of BLV Gag. Our results show that full-length BLV Gag has an elongated rod-shaped structure that is relatively rigid, with the exception of the linker between the MA and CA domains. Deletion of the MA domain maintains the elongated structure but alters the rate of BLV Gag-facilitated annealing of two complementary nucleic acids. These data are consistent with a role for the MA domain of retroviral Gag proteins in modulating nucleic acid binding and chaperone activity. IMPORTANCE: BLV is a retrovirus that is found worldwide in domestic cattle. Since BLV infection has serious implications for agriculture, and given its similarities to human retroviruses such as HTLV-1, the development of an effective treatment would have numerous benefits. The Gag polyprotein exists in all retroviruses and is a key player in viral assembly. However, the full-length structure of Gag from any virus has yet to be elucidated at high resolution. This study provides structural data for BLV Gag and could be a starting point for modeling Gag-small molecule interactions with the ultimate goal of developing of a new class of pharmaceuticals.","['Qualley, Dominic F', 'Cooper, Sarah E', 'Ross, James L', 'Olson, Erik D', 'Cantara, William A', 'Musier-Forsyth, Karin']","['Qualley DF', 'Cooper SE', 'Ross JL', 'Olson ED', 'Cantara WA', 'Musier-Forsyth K']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Center for One Health Studies, Berry College, Mt.

Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often arises from kinase mutations-however, ""off-target"" resistance occurs but is poorly understood. Previously, we established cell line resistance models for three TKIs used in chronic myeloid leukemia treatment, and found that resistance was not attributed entirely to failure of kinase inhibition. Here, we performed global, integrated proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of these cell lines to describe mechanisms of resistance at the protein and gene expression level. We used whole transcriptome sequencing and SWATH-based data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS), which does not require isotopic labels and provides quantitative measurements of proteins in a comprehensive, unbiased fashion. The proteomic and transcriptional data were correlated to generate an integrated understanding of the gene expression and protein alterations associated with TKI resistance. We defined mechanisms of resistance and two novel markers, CA1 and alpha-synuclein, that were common to all TKIs tested. Resistance to all of the TKIs was associated with oxidative stress responses, hypoxia signatures, and apparent metabolic reprogramming of the cells. Metabolite profiling and glucose-dependence experiments showed that resistant cells had routed their metabolism through glycolysis (particularly through the pentose phosphate pathway) and exhibited disruptions in mitochondrial metabolism. These experiments are the first to report a global, integrated proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolic analysis of TKI resistance. These data suggest that although the mechanisms are complex, targeting metabolic pathways along with TKI treatment may overcome pan-TKI resistance.","['Noel, Brett M', 'Ouellette, Steven B', 'Marholz, Laura', 'Dickey, Deborah', 'Navis, Connor', 'Yang, Tzu-Yi', 'Nguyen, Vinh', 'Parker, Sarah J', 'Bernlohr, David', 'Sachs, Zohar', 'Parker, Laurie L']","['Noel BM', 'Ouellette SB', 'Marholz L', 'Dickey D', 'Navis C', 'Yang TY', 'Nguyen V', 'Parker SJ', 'Bernlohr D', 'Sachs Z', 'Parker LL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Smidt Heart Institute , Cedars Sinai , Los Angeles , California 90048 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Department of Medicine , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190221,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,PMC7250065,,2019/02/08 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00028 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2019 Apr 5;18(4):1842-1856. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00028.

Olaparib inhibits enzymes involved in DNA repair. It is claimed to have an antitumour effect, especially in the presence of deleterious BRCA muta- tions. Olaparib has been authorised in the EU for continuous single-agent therapy after the end of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with ""plati- num-sensitive"" BRCA-positive ovarian cancer who have already received at least two lines of platinum-based che- motherapy and entered complete or partial remission after the last course of treatment. Clinical evaluation of olaparib is based on a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 265 patients who were recruited regardless of their BRCA status. After a median follow-up of 37 months, patients treated with olaparib showed no survival advan- tage, whether or not their tumour harboured BRCA mutations. The time to radiological progression was pro- longed by several months. An inher- ently unreliable post hoc analysis suggested that olaparib delayed the need for further chemotherapy. Olaparib exposes these patients in remission to frequent adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, and impaired haematopoiesis. Olaparib can also cause life-threatening myelo- dysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukaemia, and haemorrhage. Olaparib is metabolised in the liver, mainly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is also a P-glycoprotein substrate and is likely to inhibit CYP3A4, P-glycopro- tein and other carrier proteins. Multiple pharmacokinetic interactions are also likely. Treatment with olaparib requires patients to take eight capsules twice a day, between meals.

The purpose of this study was to propose flow cytometric (FCM) scoring systems (SSs) for predicting t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(11q23), and t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) translocations. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the FCM immunophenotype of 377 patients with B-ALL with regard to the major cytogenetic findings revealed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (i-FISH). Comparing descriptive data on the expression of each antigen and performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, we identified the most reliable predictive markers for each translocation and sought to establish a specific SS for each translocation, based on specific antibody panels. RESULTS: CD27, CD9, CD66c, CD10, CD25, and CD34 were employed for the prediction of t(12;21), CD25, CD38, CD34, and CD66c for t(9;22), NG2, CD10, CD15, CD34, and CD20 for t(11q23), and CD34, cmu, CD123, and CD66c for t(1;19). The sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of each predictive score were 89.29% and 96.15% for t(12;21), 75.00% and 88.19% for t(9;22), 84.21% and 99.04% for t(11q23), and 85.71% and 92.71% for t(1;19). CONCLUSION: Four highly specific and significantly sensitive FCM-obtained SSs are proposed for the prediction of the four major translocations observed in patients with B-ALL. Prospective evaluation of the proposed SSs could lead to a better targeted cytogenetic investigation and therefore to more cost-effective laboratory practice.","['Tsagarakis, Nikolaos J', 'Papadhimitriou, Stefanos I', 'Pavlidis, Dimitris', 'Marinakis, Theodoros', 'Kostopoulos, Ioannis V', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Polychronopoulou, Sofia', 'Paterakis, George']","['Tsagarakis NJ', 'Papadhimitriou SI', 'Pavlidis D', 'Marinakis T', 'Kostopoulos IV', 'Stiakaki E', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Paterakis G']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, Athens Regional General Hospital ""G.

There are not enough data to support for the best approach to diagnosis of HSFI in children, nor for the best treatment. PROCEDURE: In this multicentric study, we assessed the demographic data, clinical and radiologic features, treatment, and outcome of 40 children with leukemia and HSFI from 12 centers. RESULTS: All cases were radiologically diagnosed with abdominal ultrasound, which was performed at a median of 7 days, of the febrile neutropenic episode. Mucor was identified by histopathology in 1, and Candida was identified in blood cultures in 8 patients. Twenty-two had fungal infection in additional sites, mostly lungs. Nine patients died. Four received a single agent, and 36 a combination of antifungals. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of HSFI is challenging because signs and symptoms are usually nonspecific. In neutropenic children, persistent fever, back pain extending to the shoulder, widespread muscle pain, and increased serum galactomannan levels should alert clinicians. Abdominal imaging, particularly an abdominal ultrasound, which is easy to perform and available even in most resource-limited countries, should be recommended in children with prolonged neutropenic fever, even in the absence of localizing signs and symptoms.","['Celkan, Tiraje', 'Kizilocak, Hande', 'Evim, Melike', 'Meral Gunes, Adalet', 'Ozbek, Namik Y', 'Yarali, Nese', 'Unal, Ekrem', 'Patiroglu, Turkan', 'Yilmaz Karapinar, Deniz', 'Sarper, Nazan', 'Zengin, Emine', 'Karaman, Serap', 'Kocak, Ulker', 'Kurekci, Emin', 'Ozdemir, Canan', 'Tugcu, Deniz', 'Uysalol, Ezgi', 'Dikme, Gurcan', 'Adaletli, Ibrahim', 'Kuruoglu, Sebuh', 'Kebudi, Rejin']","['Celkan T', 'Kizilocak H', 'Evim M', 'Meral Gunes A', 'Ozbek NY', 'Yarali N', 'Unal E', 'Patiroglu T', 'Yilmaz Karapinar D', 'Sarper N', 'Zengin E', 'Karaman S', 'Kocak U', 'Kurekci E', 'Ozdemir C', 'Tugcu D', 'Uysalol E', 'Dikme G', 'Adaletli I', 'Kuruoglu S', 'Kebudi R']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Uludag University, Bursa.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Uludag University, Bursa.', 'Ankara Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Training and Research Hospital.', 'Ankara Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Training and Research Hospital.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Erciyes University, Kayseri.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Erciyes University, Kayseri.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Bornova.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli University, Izmit.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli University, Izmit.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University.', 'Losante Pediatric Hematology Hospital, Ankara.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa.', 'Division of Pediatric Radiology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine.', 'Division of Pediatric Radiology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Oncology Institute, Istanbul University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001431 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 May;41(4):256-260. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001431.,,,,,,,,20191213,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*immunology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications/immunology', 'Liver Diseases/drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenic Diseases/drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology']",['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the therapeutic efficacy of current JAK2 inhibitors is limited. We investigated the role of MEK/ERK signaling in MPN cell survival in the setting of JAK inhibition. Type I and II JAK2 inhibition suppressed MEK/ERK activation in MPN cell lines in vitro, but not in Jak2V617F and MPLW515L mouse models in vivo. JAK2 inhibition ex vivo inhibited MEK/ERK signaling, suggesting that cell-extrinsic factors maintain ERK activation in vivo. We identified PDGFRalpha as an activated kinase that remains activated upon JAK2 inhibition in vivo, and PDGF-AA/PDGF-BB production persisted in the setting of JAK inhibition. PDGF-BB maintained ERK activation in the presence of ruxolitinib, consistent with its function as a ligand-induced bypass for ERK activation. Combined JAK/MEK inhibition suppressed MEK/ERK activation in Jak2V617F and MPLW515L mice with increased efficacy and reversal of fibrosis to an extent not seen with JAK inhibitors. This demonstrates that compensatory ERK activation limits the efficacy of JAK2 inhibition and dual JAK/MEK inhibition provides an opportunity for improved therapeutic efficacy in MPNs and in other malignancies driven by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling.","['Stivala, Simona', 'Codilupi, Tamara', 'Brkic, Sime', 'Baerenwaldt, Anne', 'Ghosh, Nilabh', 'Hao-Shen, Hui', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Dettmer, Matthias S', 'Simillion, Cedric', 'Kaufmann, Beat A', 'Chiu, Sophia', 'Keller, Matthew', 'Kleppe, Maria', 'Hilpert, Morgane', 'Buser, Andreas S', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Radimerski, Thomas', 'Skoda, Radek C', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Meyer, Sara C']","['Stivala S', 'Codilupi T', 'Brkic S', 'Baerenwaldt A', 'Ghosh N', 'Hao-Shen H', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Dettmer MS', 'Simillion C', 'Kaufmann BA', 'Chiu S', 'Keller M', 'Kleppe M', 'Hilpert M', 'Buser AS', 'Passweg JR', 'Radimerski T', 'Skoda RC', 'Levine RL', 'Meyer SC']","['Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of BioMedical Research, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190304,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC6436863,,2019/02/08 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2017/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['98785 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI98785 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Invest. 2019 Mar 4;129(4):1596-1611. doi: 10.1172/JCI98785. eCollection 2019 Mar 4.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']","['K99 HL122503/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,20200615,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Becaplermin/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics/metabolism']","['0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (platelet-derived growth factor A)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,['J Clin Invest. 2019 Mar 4;129(4):1519-1521.

We hereby describe the case of a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. An asymptomatic 40-year-old female was diagnosed with primary lung leiomyosarcoma (T3N0), adenocarcinoma (T1aN0), and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, which were surgically removed without further treatment. Twenty months later she underwent surgery for retroperitoneal liposarcoma and even though she received adjuvant chemotherapy, deceased shortly after. Due to family history, the patient underwent TP53 mutation testing, using peripheral blood genomic DNA, which identified a heterozygous, likely pathogenic missense mutation (c.722C>G p.Ser241Cys) in case of the mother and her son. Three years after the patient's death, her 17-year-old son was diagnosed with a 3.5 cm osteosarcoma of the right second rib, which was surgically removed, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, despite treatment, he deceased after two years. Throughout four generations of the patient's family, 10 malignant tumors (stomach-, breast-, 2 lung-, and colon cancer, leukemia, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma and 2 osteosarcoma) were diagnosed with a mean age of 43.2 (13-70 years) years. The simultaneous appearance of primary lung leiomyosarcoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and adenocarcinoma in the same organ is extremely rare. When possible, surgical resection should be carried out. Genetic testing for TP53 is recommended when family history is suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Prognosis remains poor.

The main challenge lies in the subtle differences in morphologic characteristics among these classes, which requires a refined segmentation. A new efficient segmentation framework has been developed, which uses the image color information through fuzzy clustering of different color components and the application of the watershed transformation with markers. The final result is the separation of three regions of interest: nucleus, entire cell, and peripheral zone around the cell. Segmentation of this zone is crucial to extract a new feature to identify cells with hair-like projections. The segmentation is validated, using a database of 4758 cell images with normal, reactive lymphocytes and five types of malignant lymphoid cells from blood smears of 105 patients, in two ways: (1) the efficiency in the accurate separation of the regions of interest, which is 92.24%, and (2) the accuracy of a classification system implemented over the segmented cells, which is 91.54%. In conclusion, the proposed segmentation framework is suitable to distinguish among abnormal blood cells with subtile color and spatial similarities. Graphical Abstract The segmentation framework uses the image color information through fuzzy clustering of different color components and the application of the watershed transformation with markers (Top). The final result is the separation of three regions of interest: nucleus, entire cell, and peripheral zone around the cell.

Some decolonized patients later develop recurrent growth of VRE from surveillance or clinical cultures (ie, ""recolonized""), although that finding may represent recrudescence or new acquisition of VRE. We describe the dynamics of VRE colonization and infection and their relationship to receipt of antibiotics. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of patients at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, baseline characteristics were collected via chart review. Antibiotic exposure and hospital days were calculated as proportions of VRE decolonized days. Using survival analysis, we assessed the relationship between antibiotic exposure and time to VRE recolonization in a subcohort analysis of 72 decolonized patients. RESULTS: In total, 350 patients were either colonized or infected with VRE. Among polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive, culture (Cx)-negative (PCR+/Cx-) patients, PCR had a 39% positive predictive value for colonization. Colonization with VRE was significantly associated with VRE infection. Among 72 patients who met decolonization criteria, 21 (29%) subsequently became recolonized. VRE recolonization was 4.3 (P = .001) and 2.0 (P = .22) times higher in patients with proportions of antibiotic days and antianaerobic antibiotic days above the median, respectively. CONCLUSION: Colonization is associated with clinical VRE infection and increased mortality. Despite negative perirectal cultures, re-exposure to antibiotics increases the risk of VRE recolonization.","['Hughes, Heather Y', 'Odom, Robin T', 'Michelin, Angela V', 'Snitkin, Evan S', 'Sinaii, Ninet', 'Milstone, Aaron M', 'Henderson, David K', 'Palmore, Tara N']","['Hughes HY', 'Odom RT', 'Michelin AV', 'Snitkin ES', 'Sinaii N', 'Milstone AM', 'Henderson DK', 'Palmore TN']","['The Ralph H.

We asked survivors if they had been told they had been cured and investigated associated factors. PROCEDURE: We used nationwide registry data and a questionnaire survey for >/=five-year survivors of childhood cancer (n = 301), followed by online focus groups with a purposive sample of Swiss pediatric oncologists (n = 17). Discussions were coded by investigators using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 235 among 301 survivors (78%; 95% confidence interval, 73%-83%) reported having been told they were cured. The proportion was 89% (81%-97%) among lymphoma and 84% (77%-91%) among leukemia survivors, but only 49% (33%-65%) among central nervous system tumor survivors. Pediatric oncologists acknowledged that telling survivors they are cured may reassure them that their cancer lies behind them. However, many refrained from telling all patients. Reasons included the possibility of late effects (cure disrupted by a continued need for follow-up care) or late relapse (uncertainty of biological cure), case-by-case strategies (use of ""cure"" according to individual factors), and reluctance (substitution of noncommittal terms for ""cure""; waiting for the patient to raise the topic). CONCLUSIONS: Not all physicians tell survivors they have been cured; their choices depend on the cancer type and risk of late effects.","['Essig, Stefan', 'Michel, Gisela', 'Dupont, Carole', 'Kiss, Alexander', 'Bergstraesser, Eva', 'Tinner, Eva Maria', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Essig S', 'Michel G', 'Dupont C', 'Kiss A', 'Bergstraesser E', 'Tinner EM', 'Kuehni CE']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Primary and Community Care, Lucerne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Health Policy, University of Lucerne, Lucerne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland."", 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190207,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27661 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27661. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27661.

We investigated L-selectin expression on CLL cells and explored the mechanisms that lead to their shedding. METHODS: Surface and soluble L-selectin expression levels were studied by flow cytometry and immunoassay, respectively. Magnetically isolated B-cells from patients and controls were investigated for total and protein phosphatase-2A activities. Flow cytometry of permeabilized cells was utilized for the determination of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (pp38MAPK) and surface tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme expression (TACE). RESULTS: In CLL patients elevated absolute lymphocyte cell counts, high soluble and low surface L-selectin expression were observed. Similarly, TACE surface expression was significantly lower on B-CLL cells compared to normal B-cells. Both total phosphatase and protein phosphatase-2A activities were also significantly lower in B-CLL cells compared to normal B-cells and we found a consequently higher level of pp38 MAPK in B-CLL cells. Based on in vitro experiments a MAPK inhibitor could attenuate the phosphatase inhibitor's effect on L-selectin shedding. CONCLUSIONS: The lower phosphatase activity detectable in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, results in a downstream signaling cascade with subsequent reduction of surface L-selectin expression and this effect is mediated by enhanced phosphorylation of p38MAPK and an altered TACE expression.

We examined the relationship between nutritional status (NS), assessed by arm anthropometry, and socioeconomic status (SES) in children diagnosed with cancer at Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica (UNOP) in Guatemala over a three-year period. METHOD: Patients aged 0 to 18 years of age diagnosed between January 2015 and December 2017 were included. NS was evaluated by mid-upper arm circumference, triceps skin fold thickness, and serum albumin level, and subjects were classified as adequately nourished, moderately depleted, and severely depleted nutritionally. SES was measured by a 15-item instrument developed at UNOP. RESULTS: Of 1365 patients diagnosed in the study period, 1060 (78%) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Only 6% of patients were classified as medium to high, the remainder as medium-low to extremely low SES. Almost 47% were severely depleted at diagnosis, 19% moderately depleted, and 34% adequately nourished. SES was shown to be a determinant of NS; with progressively lower SES, the probability of a decline in NS increased by a factor of 1.04 points (P < 0.0001). Leukemia and lymphoma were also important predictors of nutritional depletion with odds ratios of 6.08 (95% CI, 1.74-28.28; P = 0.008) for leukemias and 4.83 (95% CI, 1.33-23.03; P = 0.03) for lymphomas. CONCLUSION: Both low SES and a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma are strong predictors of poor NS at diagnosis in children with cancer in Guatemala.","['Villanueva, Gabriela', 'Blanco, Jessica', 'Rivas, Silvia', 'Molina, Ana Lucia', 'Lopez, Nidia', 'Fuentes, Ana Lucia', 'Muller, Leslie', 'Caceres, Annie', 'Antillon, Federico', 'Ladas, Elena', 'Barr, Ronald D']","['Villanueva G', 'Blanco J', 'Rivas S', 'Molina AL', 'Lopez N', 'Fuentes AL', 'Muller L', 'Caceres A', 'Antillon F', 'Ladas E', 'Barr RD']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois."", 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'School of Medicine, Francisco Marroquin University, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Pathology and Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190207,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27647 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27647. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27647.

We evaluated determinants of low lymphocyte collection efficiency (CE) and the rate of successful CAR T-cell manufacture in middle-aged and older adults with advanced B-cell malignancies. STUDY DESIGNS AND METHODS: Mononuclear cell collections using two apheresis platforms (COBE Spectra and Spectra Optia, Terumo BCT) from patients participating in a CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy trial were reviewed. Patient- and disease-specific factors, peripheral blood counts, apheresis parameters, and product cell counts were analyzed to determine effects on lymphocyte CE. RESULTS: Ninety-two apheresis events from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n = 28), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 18), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 46) were available for analysis. Forty-one collections (45%) had a lymphocyte CE of <40%. On multivariable analysis, age (every 10-year increase, odds ratio [OR] = 1.51; p = 0.034), disease type (chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs. ALL, OR = 0.24; p = 0.052; non-Hodgkin lymphoma vs. ALL, OR = 0.20; p = 0.009) and precollection platelets (every 10 x 10(3) /muL increase, OR = 1.07; p = 0.005) were appreciably associated with a lymphocyte CE of <40%. No major apheresis complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte collection at our center was well tolerated and 100% successful in manufacturing CD19-directed CAR T cells from adult patients with B-cell malignancies despite low CE in some patients. A diagnosis of ALL, advancing age, and higher preapheresis platelet counts were observed to be associated with low CE.","['Tuazon, Sherilyn A', 'Li, Ang', 'Gooley, Theodore', 'Eunson, Thomas W', 'Maloney, David G', 'Turtle, Cameron J', 'Linenberger, Michael L', 'Connelly-Smith, Laura S']","['Tuazon SA', 'Li A', 'Gooley T', 'Eunson TW', 'Maloney DG', 'Turtle CJ', 'Linenberger ML', 'Connelly-Smith LS']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190206,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,PMC6499685,,2019/02/08 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15178 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2019 May;59(5):1773-1780. doi: 10.1111/trf.15178.

METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with CML using nilotinib participated in this multicenter observational study. Patients were asked to perform blood sampling by means of the DBS method at home just before drug intake (trough level) and to complete a questionnaire including demographics and five questions on their experience with DBS self-sampling. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (57.5 +/- 15.0 years, 49% female) provided 178 DBS samples of which 137 (77%) proved useful in clinical practice. Twenty percent of the samples were rejected because the spot size was too small for analysis. A further 3% were taken at the wrong time. Unsuitable DBS samples were provided by 23 patients. Their educational level was significantly lower than that of patients whose samples were all suitable (p = 0.041). Patients considered DBS self-sampling easy and not painful, and three quarters of the patients performed DBS sampling without additional assistance. Patients' belief in the reliability of DBS self-sampling was moderate to high. It was preferred over venous sampling by 37% of the patients, whereas 39% had no preference. CONCLUSION: DBS self-sampling by CML patients is feasible in clinical practice provided that patients, particularly those with a lower educational level, are adequately instructed about sample collection with emphasis on timing and volume of sample collection.","['Boons, Christel C L M', 'Timmers, Lonneke', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Swart, Eleonora L', 'Hugtenburg, Jacqueline G', 'Hendrikse, N Harry']","['Boons CCLM', 'Timmers L', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Swart EL', 'Hugtenburg JG', 'Hendrikse NH']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. c.boons@vumc.nl.', 'Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. c.boons@vumc.nl.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20190207,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00228-019-02640-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00228-019-02640-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Jun;75(6):825-829. doi: 10.1007/s00228-019-02640-1.

In this study, we conducted a retrospective study in adult AML patients with newly diagnosed with de novo AML who did not undergo HSCT, to study long term relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after consolidation chemotherapy. Methods: We recruited 141 consecutive AML patients during January 2010-June 2017, the patients received induction chemotherapy with standard dose Ara-C and Idarubicin (7 + 3 or 5 + 2 regimen) followed by intermediate (IDAC) or high dose Ara-c (HiDAC) consolidation therapy. Results: Normal karyotype, complex, favorable, intermediate and adverse chromosomal aberrations were found in 59%, 16%, 5%, 14% and 6%, respectively. Mutated NPM1, FLT3-ITD and CEBPA genes in CN-AML were seen in 33%, 18% and 19%, respectively. A 5 year follow up, 5y-RFS was 16% and 5y-OS was 14% in the whole study population. 5y-RFS and 5y-OS in patients completed 4 cycles of consolidation therapy were 25% and 40%, respectively. Adverse cytogenetic risk and mutated FLT3-ITD were significantly associated with poor RFS (9 and 15 months, respectively) and OS (14 and 16 months, respectively), whereas patients with mutant NPM1 had favorable outcomes (RFS/OS = 51/63 months). Patients receiving 4 cycles of consolidation therapy had significantly impacts on median RFS and OS compared with those treated with 1 or 2 cycles; 15 versus 11 months (p = 0.006) and 31 versus 15 months (p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: Cytogenetic and mutation tests for FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and CEBPA genes were meaningful for predicting outcomes in adult AML patients. Adverse cytogenetic abnormalities and FLT3-ITD mutation showed dismal RFS and OS.","['Niparuck, Pimjai', 'Limsuwanachot, Nittaya', 'Pukiat, Sulada', 'Chantrathammachart, Pichika', 'Rerkamnuaychoke, Budsaba', 'Magmuang, Sutada', 'Phusanti, Sithakom', 'Boonyawat, Kochawan', 'Puavilai, Teeraya', 'Angchaisuksiri, Pantep', 'Ungkanont, Artit', 'Chuncharunee, Suporn']","['Niparuck P', 'Limsuwanachot N', 'Pukiat S', 'Chantrathammachart P', 'Rerkamnuaychoke B', 'Magmuang S', 'Phusanti S', 'Boonyawat K', 'Puavilai T', 'Angchaisuksiri P', 'Ungkanont A', 'Chuncharunee S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Human Genetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Human Genetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Human Genetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '3Department of Medicine, Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.0000 0004 1937 0490grid.10223.32', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '3Department of Medicine, Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.0000 0004 1937 0490grid.10223.32', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190130,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,PMC6354374,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/02/08 06:01,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-019-0127-z [doi]', '127 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2019 Jan 30;8:3. doi: 10.1186/s40164-019-0127-z. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CEBPA', 'Cytogenetics', 'FLT3-ITD', 'NPM1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The microwave process was compared to a conventional thermal treatment with similar temperature set points. Both processes were deeply analysed in terms of the thermal kinetics and operating conditions. The pepsin hydrolysates obtained by the continuous microwave treatment and conventional heating were characterized by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The allergenicity of the whey protein hydrolysates was explored using a human IgE sensitized rat basophil leukaemia cell assay. The results indicate that extensively hydrolysed whey protein hydrolysates were obtained by microwave only at 65 degrees C and in a shorter time compared with the conventional thermal treatment. In the same temperature conditions under conventional heating, beta-lactoglobulin was resistant to pepsinolysis, and 37% of it remained intact. As demonstrated by an in vitro degranulation assay using specific human IgE-sensitized rat basophils, the extensively hydrolysed whey protein obtained by microwave showed maximum degranulation values of 6.53% compared to those of the native whey protein isolate (45.97%) and hence elicited no more allergenic reactions in basophils. This work emphasizes the potential industrial use of microwave heating specific to milk protein processing to reduce their allergenicity and improve their end-use properties.","['El Mecherfi, Kamel Eddine', 'Curet, Sebastien', 'Lupi, Roberta', 'Larre, Colette', 'Rouaud, Olivier', 'Choiset, Yvan', 'Rabesona, Hanitra', 'Haertle, Thomas']","['El Mecherfi KE', 'Curet S', 'Lupi R', 'Larre C', 'Rouaud O', 'Choiset Y', 'Rabesona H', 'Haertle T']","['UR 1268 Biopolymeres Interactions Assemblages, Equipe Fonctions et Interactions des Proteines, INRA, 44316 Nantes Cedex 03, France.', '2CNRS, GEPEA, UMR 6144, Site de la Geraudiere, ONIRIS, 44322 Nantes, France.0000 0001 2175 3974grid.418682.1', ""3Laboratoire de Physiologie de la Nutrition et de Securite Alimentaire, Universite d'Oran 1, Ahmed Benbella, Algeria.0000 0001 2347 0804grid.440479.a"", 'UR 1268 Biopolymeres Interactions Assemblages, Equipe Allergie, INRA, 44316 Nantes Cedex 03, France.', '2CNRS, GEPEA, UMR 6144, Site de la Geraudiere, ONIRIS, 44322 Nantes, France.0000 0001 2175 3974grid.418682.1', 'UR 1268 Biopolymeres Interactions Assemblages, Equipe Allergie, INRA, 44316 Nantes Cedex 03, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymeres Interactions Assemblages, Equipe Allergie, INRA, 44316 Nantes Cedex 03, France.', '2CNRS, GEPEA, UMR 6144, Site de la Geraudiere, ONIRIS, 44322 Nantes, France.0000 0001 2175 3974grid.418682.1', 'UR 1268 Biopolymeres Interactions Assemblages, Equipe Fonctions et Interactions des Proteines, INRA, 44316 Nantes Cedex 03, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymeres Interactions Assemblages, Equipe Fonctions et Interactions des Proteines, INRA, 44316 Nantes Cedex 03, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymeres Interactions Assemblages, Equipe Fonctions et Interactions des Proteines, INRA, 44316 Nantes Cedex 03, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181108,India,J Food Sci Technol,Journal of food science and technology,0056471,PMC6342792,"['Compliance with ethical standardsThe authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",2019/02/08 06:00,2019/02/08 06:01,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13197-018-3471-9 [doi]', '3471 [pii]']",ppublish,J Food Sci Technol. 2019 Jan;56(1):177-186. doi: 10.1007/s13197-018-3471-9.

30728528,NLM,MEDLINE,20210212,1530-0366 (Electronic) 1098-3600 (Linking),21,9,2019 Sep,Impact of NUDT15 genetics on severe thiopurine-related hematotoxicity in patients with European ancestry.,2145-2150,10.1038/s41436-019-0448-7 [doi],"PURPOSE: Severe hematotoxicity in patients with thiopurine therapy has been associated with genetic polymorphisms in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). While TPMT genetic testing is clinically implemented for dose individualization, alterations in the nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) emerged as independent determinant of thiopurine-related hematotoxicity. Because data for European patients are limited, we investigated the relevance of NUDT15 in Europeans. METHODS: Additionally to TPMT phenotyping/genotyping, we performed in-depth Sanger sequencing analyses of NUDT15 coding region in 107 European patients who developed severe thiopurine-related hematotoxicity as extreme phenotype. Moreover, genotyping for NUDT15 variants in 689 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients was performed. RESULTS: As expected TPMT was the main cause of severe hematotoxicity in 31% of patients, who were either TPMT deficient (10%) or heterozygous carriers of TPMT variants (21%). By comparison, NUDT15 genetic polymorphism was identified in 14 (13%) patients including one novel variant (p.Met1Ile). Six percent of patients with severe toxicity carried variants in both TPMT and NUDT15. Among patients who developed toxicity within 3 months of treatment, 13% were found to be carriers of NUDT15 variants. CONCLUSION: Taken together, NUDT15 and TPMT genetics explain ~50% of severe thiopurine-related hematotoxicity, providing a compelling rationale for additional preemptive testing of NUDT15 genetics not only in Asians, but also in Europeans.","['Schaeffeler, Elke', 'Jaeger, Simon U', 'Klumpp, Verena', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Igel, Svitlana', 'Hinze, Laura', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schwab, Matthias']","['Schaeffeler E', 'Jaeger SU', 'Klumpp V', 'Yang JJ', 'Igel S', 'Hinze L', 'Stanulla M', 'Schwab M']","['Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Hematological Malignancies Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, St. Jude Children's Research, Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany. matthias.schwab@ikp-stuttgart.de.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. matthias.schwab@ikp-stuttgart.de.', 'Departments of Clinical Pharmacology and Biochemistry, Yerevan State Medical University, Yerevan, Armenia. matthias.schwab@ikp-stuttgart.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190207,United States,Genet Med,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,9815831,PMC6752748,,2019/02/08 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41436-019-0448-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41436-019-0448-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Genet Med. 2019 Sep;21(9):2145-2150. doi: 10.1038/s41436-019-0448-7.

RNA within single cells can be analyzed using unbiased sequencing protocols or through more targeted approaches using in situ hybridization (ISH). The proximity ligation assay for RNA (PLAYR) approach is a sensitive and high-throughput technique that relies on in situ and proximal ligation to measure at least 27 specific RNAs by flow or mass cytometry. We provide detailed instructions for combining this technique with antibody-based detection of surface/internal protein, allowing simultaneous highly multiplexed profiling of RNA and protein expression at single-cell resolution. PLAYR overcomes limitations on multiplexing seen in previous branching DNA-based RNA detection techniques by integration of a transcript-specific oligonucleotide sequence within a rolling-circle amplification (RCA). This unique transcript-associated sequence can then be detected by heavy metal (for mass cytometry)- or fluorophore (for flow cytometry)-conjugated complementary detection oligonucleotides. Included in this protocol is methodology to label oligonucleotides with lanthanide metals for use in mass cytometry. When analyzed by mass cytometry, up to 40 variables (with scope for future expansion) can be measured simultaneously. We used the described protocol to demonstrate intraclonal heterogeneity within primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, but it can be adapted to other primary cells or cell lines in suspension. This robust, reliable and reproducible protocol can be completed in 2-3 d and can be paused at several stages for convenience.","['Duckworth, Andrew D', 'Gherardini, Pier Federico', 'Sykorova, Martina', 'Yasin, Faten', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh']","['Duckworth AD', 'Gherardini PF', 'Sykorova M', 'Yasin F', 'Nolan GP', 'Slupsky JR', 'Kalakonda N']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Baxter Laboratory in Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Baxter Laboratory in Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. nageshk@liverpool.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190206,England,Nat Protoc,Nature protocols,101284307,PMC7075472,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41596-018-0120-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41596-018-0120-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Protoc. 2019 Mar;14(3):901-920. doi: 10.1038/s41596-018-0120-8.

Patients were randomized to four induction schedules for two cycles: STANDARD (idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide); and azacitidine given prior (PRIOR), concurrently (CONCURRENT), or after (AFTER) therapy with idarubicin and etoposide. Consolidation therapy consisted of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation or three courses of high-dose cytarabine followed by 2-year maintenance therapy with azacitidine in the azacitidine-arms. AML with CBFB-MYH11, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, mutated NPM1, and FLT3-ITD were excluded and accrued to genotype-specific trials. The primary end point was response to induction therapy. The statistical design was based on an optimal two-stage design applied for each arm separately. During the first stage, 104 patients (median age 62.6, range 18-82 years) were randomized; the study arms PRIOR and CONCURRENT were terminated early due to inefficacy.

Together, these agents offer a mutation-directed treatment approach for up to 45% of de novo adult AML cases, a welcome deluge after a prolonged drought. At the same time, a number of computational tools have recently been developed that promise to further accelerate progress in mutation-specific therapy for AML and other cancers. Technical advances together with comprehensively annotated AML tissue banks have resulted in the availability of large and complex data sets for exploration by the end-user, including (i) microarray gene expression, (ii) exome sequencing, (iii) deep sequencing data of sub-clone heterogeneity, (iv) RNA sequencing of gene expression (bulk and single cell), (v) DNA methylation and chromatin, (vi) and germline quantitative trait loci. Yet few clinicians or experimental hematologists have the time or the training to access or analyze these repositories. This review summarizes the data sets and bioinformatic tools currently available to further the discovery of mutation-specific targets with an emphasis on web-based applications that are open, accessible, user-friendly, and do not require coding experience to navigate. We show examples of how available data can be mined to identify potential targets using synthetic lethality, drug repurposing, epigenetic sub-grouping, and proteomic networks while also highlighting strengths and limitations and the need for superior models for validation.","['Benard, Brooks', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Kohnke, Thomas', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Thomas, Daniel']","['Benard B', 'Gentles AJ', 'Kohnke T', 'Majeti R', 'Thomas D']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine (Biomedical Informatics), and Biomedical Data Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. rmajeti@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. dthomas3@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190206,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC7250137,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0387-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0387-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Apr;33(4):826-843. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0387-y.

Anti apoptosis is one of the main mechanisms to mediate drug resistance. Studies have shown that MCL-1 plays a key role in the growth of cancer cells ""escaping"" drug attacks, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that lncRNA H19 was highly expressed in the serum of MM patients. Bioinformatics predicts that miR-29b-3p is the downstream target gene, and MCL-1 is the downstream target protein of miR-29b-3p. Therefore, we speculated that MCL-1 may be involved in the occurrence of drug resistance through epigenetics. On the basis of these previous findings, the present study was intended to explore the biological function of H19, interactions between the downstream target genes, and the effect of H19 on BTZ resistance of myeloma cells. In addition, in vivo experiments we have also confirmed that H19 promoted tumor growth and may develop resistance to bortezomib partly. It was found that H19 reduced cell sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug BTZ by working as a miRNA sponge to inhibit the expression of miR-29b-3p, enhance MCL-1 transcriptional translation and inhibit apoptosis. These findings may help gain insights into the molecular mechanism of acquired BTZ resistance and develop new drug targets for the clinical treatment of MM.","['Pan, Yafang', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Liu, Wenwen', 'Huang, Yan', 'Shen, Xianjuan', 'Jing, Rongrong', 'Pu, Jiang', 'Wang, Xudong', 'Ju, Shaoqing', 'Cong, Hui', 'Chen, Hongmei']","['Pan Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu W', 'Huang Y', 'Shen X', 'Jing R', 'Pu J', 'Wang X', 'Ju S', 'Cong H', 'Chen H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China. huicjs@163.com.', 'Department of General Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China. chm1923@163.com.', 'Vip ward, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China. chm1923@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190206,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC6365572,,2019/02/08 06:00,2020/06/05 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-1219-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-1219-0 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Feb 6;10(2):106. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-1219-0.,,,,,,,,20200604,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (H19 long non-coding RNA)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated physician use of orally administered cancer drugs for four cancers: prostate (abiraterone, enzalutamide), renal cell (axitinib, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib), lung (afatinib, erlotinib), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib). Separate physician cohorts were defined for each cancer type by prescribing history. The primary exposure was the number of calendar years during 2013-2015 in which a physician received payments from the manufacturer of one of the studied drugs; the outcome was relative prescribing of that drug in 2015, compared with the other drugs for that cancer. We evaluated whether practice setting at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, receipt of payments for purposes other than education or research (compensation payments), maximum annual dollar value received, and institutional conflict-of-interest policies were associated with the strength of the payment-prescribing association. We used modified Poisson regression to control confounding by other physician characteristics. RESULTS: Physicians who received payments for a drug in all 3 years had increased prescribing of that drug (compared with 0 years), for renal cell (relative risk [RR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-2.07), CML (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.39), and lung (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.58-1.82), but not prostate (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1.02). Physicians who received compensation payments or >$100 annually had increased prescribing compared with those who did not, but NCI setting and institutional conflict-of-interest policies were not consistently associated with the direction of prescribing change. CONCLUSION: The association between industry payments and cancer drug prescribing was greatest among physicians who received payments consistently (within each calendar year). Receipt of payments for compensation purposes, such as for consulting or travel, and higher dollar value of payments were also associated with increased prescribing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Financial payments from pharmaceutical companies are common among oncologists. It is known from prior work that oncologists tend to prescribe more of the drugs made by companies that have given them money. By combining records of industry gifts with prescribing records, this study identifies the consistency of payments over time, the dollar value of payments, and payments for compensation as factors that may strengthen the association between receiving payments and increased prescribing of that company's drug.","['Mitchell, Aaron P', 'Winn, Aaron N', 'Lund, Jennifer L', 'Dusetzina, Stacie B']","['Mitchell AP', 'Winn AN', 'Lund JL', 'Dusetzina SB']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York New York, USA mitchea2@mskcc.org.', 'School of Pharmacy, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20190206,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,PMC6516135,"['Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest may be found at the end of this', 'article.']",2019/02/08 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2018-0423 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0423 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2019 May;24(5):632-639. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0423.

When driven by MLL-AF9, leukemia cells in the adult microenvironment sustained a myeloid phenotype, whereas the neonatal microenvironment supported genesis of mixed early B cell/myeloid leukemia. In MLL-ENL leukemia, the neonatal microenvironment potentiated B-lymphoid differentiation compared with the adult.

However, the factors associated with durable remissions after CAR T-cell therapy have not been fully elucidated. We studied patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL enrolled in a phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by CD19 CAR T-cell therapy at our institution. Forty-five (85%) of 53 patients who received CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and were evaluable for response achieved MRD-negative CR by high-resolution flow cytometry. With a median follow-up of 30.9 months, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly better in the patients who achieved MRD-negative CR compared with those who did not (median EFS, 7.6 vs 0.8 months; P < .0001; median OS, 20.0 vs 5.0 months; P = .014). In patients who achieved MRD-negative CR by flow cytometry, absence of the index malignant clone by IGH deep sequencing was associated with better EFS (P = .034). Stepwise multivariable modeling in patients achieving MRD-negative CR showed that lower prelymphodepletion lactate dehydrogenase concentration (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38 per 100 U/L increment increase), higher prelymphodepletion platelet count (HR, 0.74 per 50 000/muL increment increase), incorporation of fludarabine into the lymphodepletion regimen (HR, 0.25), and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after CAR T-cell therapy (HR, 0.39) were associated with better EFS. These data allow identification of patients at higher risk of relapse after CAR T-cell immunotherapy who might benefit from consolidation strategies such as allogeneic HCT.

Considering TdT potential as a target in cancer therapy, the present study aimed to investigate splicing alteration of TdT pre-mRNA in Molt-4 cells using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) octaarginine and cholic acid conjugates. METHOD: We examined 16 mer PNAs targeting 5' and 3' junctions of intron 7 and addressed their mRNA splicing modulation effects using RT-PCR analysis. We also tested corresponding 2-base mismatch PNAs to confirm the sequence specificity. In addition, protien level of TdT, apoptosis induction and cell viability rate were analysed. RESULTS: PCR analysis showed that full match PNAs could modulate the splicing process, thereby producing a longer mRNA still including intron 7. PCR results also implied exon 7 skipping. In addition, reduced level of TdT protein in Molt-4 cells was observed. Downregulation of TdT level in PNA treated cells was accompanied by an increased rate of apoptosis and decreased the level of cell survival. CONCLUSION: PNA-mediated splicing modulation can specifically downregulate TdT expression. TdT dowregulation results in apoptosis induction and reduced cell survival in Molt-4 cells. These observations could draw more attentions to develop PNA based strategies for TdT suppression and consequent apoptosis induction in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Montazersaheb, Soheila', 'Kazemi, Masoumeh', 'Nabat, Elahe', 'Nielsen, Peter E', 'Hejazi, Mohammad S']","['Montazersaheb S', 'Kazemi M', 'Nabat E', 'Nielsen PE', 'Hejazi MS']","['Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, The Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Health and Medical Science, Blegdamsvej 3, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,,,2019/02/08 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2019/02/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPB-EPUB-96440 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201020666190206202650 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2019;20(2):168-178. doi: 10.2174/1389201020666190206202650.,['NOTNLM'],"['Antisense', 'PNA (peptide nucleic acid)', 'TdT', 'exon skipping', 'intron retention', 'splicing inhibition.']",,,,,,20190812,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/*pharmacology', '*RNA Splicing']","['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDGFRB-rearranged MLN sensitive to imatinib were described in adult patients. We report the first pediatric patient with PDGFRB-rearranged myeloproliferative disorder associated with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma bearing the t(5; 14)(q33;q32) translocation who was successfully treated with imatinib only. Methods/Aims: Analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization identified the PDGFRB partner as CCDC88C. Whole genome sequencing of the patient's DNA identified the exact junction site, confirmed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was designed to quantify the fused CCDC88C-PDGFRB product. RESULTS: A 2.5-year-old boy was diagnosed with myeloproliferative disorder and eosinophilia associated with lymphoblastic lymphoma both bearing the CCDC88C-PDGFRB fusion.

A 71-year-old previously healthy man complained of physical fatigue and exhibited anemia (hemoglobin, 10.5 g/dl) with lymphocytosis (76%) showing LGL. The LGL cells expressed CD3, CD7, CD8, and T-cell receptor (TCR) -alpha/beta. TCR-beta/gamma gene rearrangement was positive. He was thus diagnosed with CD8() T-LGL leukemia. Anemia progressed with low reticulocyte count (0.11%), and the patient became blood transfusion-dependent, but no distinct abnormality caused the anemia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed an increase in lymphocytes (33.6%) and a decrease in erythroblasts (M/E ratio, 6.1). He was thus diagnosed with T-LGL-associated PRCA. Oral cyclosporin A administration resulted in prompt improvement of anemia, suggesting its high sensitivity. Whole-exome sequencing of his peripheral blood DNA revealed somatic mutations in 33 genes, including the STAT3 gene, implying their roles in T-LGL leukemia.","['Adachi, Masaaki', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Ogawa, Seishi']","['Adachi M', 'Yoshida K', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Chiba K', 'Miyano S', 'Ogawa S']","['Hematology Division, JCHO Sapporo Hokushin Hospital.', 'Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University.', 'Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.', 'Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.', 'Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.', 'Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/08/15 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.60.39 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2019;60(1):39-45. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.60.39.,['NOTNLM'],"['Exome sequencing', 'Large granular lymphocyte', 'Pure red cell aplasia', 'STAT3 mutation']",,,,,,20190814,,"['Aged', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*complications', 'Lymphocytosis', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*drug therapy', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics']","['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DAS was increased to 100 mg/day because only minimum cytogenetic response was evident even after 9 months, but CML progressed to the accelerated phase after 18 months. The ABL kinase domain mutations T315I and F317L were detected. Ponatinib (PON) was not yet approved, and he declined allogeneic stem cell transplantation therapy. He commenced interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in addition to DAS, and the F317L mutation (only) disappeared after 7 months; the patient achieved a major cytogenetic response. In January 20XX4, he commenced PON monotherapy (the drug was approved by this time) and achieved a major molecular response after 8 months. The T315I mutation disappeared during PON therapy.

POSTN deletion significantly decreases leukemia burden in mice; however, the underlying mechanisms by which POSTN promotes B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) progression remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) express higher levels of POSTN when co-cultured with B-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. POSTN deficiency in BM-MSCs significantly decreases CCL2 expression in co-cultured B-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, POSTN treatment increases expression of CCL2 in B-ALL cells by activating the integrin-ILK-NF-kappaB pathway. Conversely, CCL2 treatment upregulates expression of POSTN in BM-MSCs via STAT3 activation. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between POSTN expression and CCL2 level in the BM of mice and patients with B-ALL. These findings suggest that B-ALL cell-derived CCL2 contributes to the increased leukemia burden promoted by BM-MSC-derived POSTN.","['Ma, Zhenling', 'Zhao, Xueli', 'Deng, Mingjiao', 'Huang, Zhengjie', 'Wang, Jing', 'Wu, Yi', 'Cui, Dan', 'Liu, Yingfu', 'Liu, Rushi', 'Ouyang, Gaoliang']","['Ma Z', 'Zhao X', 'Deng M', 'Huang Z', 'Wang J', 'Wu Y', 'Cui D', 'Liu Y', 'Liu R', 'Ouyang G']","['State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China; Cancer Research Center of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China; College of Life Sciences, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450002, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China; Cancer Research Center of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China; Cancer Research Center of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China; Cancer Research Center of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan 410005, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China; Cancer Research Center of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'Laboratory of Medical Molecular and Immunological Diagnostics, School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, China.

Though there are several ongoing studies underscoring the role of the splicing regulator polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (PTBP2) in neuronal cells, we unveil the role of PTBP2 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Different RNA binding proteins (RBP's) earlier reported in chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis (CML-BC) cases (n=28) from Radich Oncomine leukemia dataset, were compared. We observed increased expression of MSI2 followed by PTBP2 in BC cases and increased PTBP2 expression in relapsed cases (n=10) from the same dataset compared to other RBPs. We also observed increased PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion in KCL22, a granulocytic lineage CML cell line when compared to other CML cell lines of different lineages. As PTBP2 protein expression is associated with PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion, we observed in cell lines and in a set of progressed cases (n=4) that increased BCR-ABL1 expression potentiates PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion and thus confers the existence of a functional protein. Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 with imatinib not only blocks the inclusion of exon 10 but also deregulates PTBP2 expression in CML cells. Knockdown of PTBP2 in KCL22 cells leads to reduced cell proliferation, increased G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Taken together our study portrays PTBP2 as a new possible target for CML and progressive inclusion/exclusion of PTBP2 exon 10 might play an important role in CML progression.","['Nandagopalan, S Rajashree', 'Agatheeswaran, Subramaniam', 'Vadlamudi, Yellamandayya', 'Biswas, Sutapa', 'Biswas, Ghanshyam', 'Pattnayak, Naresh Chandra', 'Chakraborty, Soumen']","['Nandagopalan SR', 'Agatheeswaran S', 'Vadlamudi Y', 'Biswas S', 'Biswas G', 'Pattnayak NC', 'Chakraborty S']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Bhubaneswar 751023, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Bhubaneswar 751023, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Bhubaneswar 751023, India.', 'Sparsh Hospital and Critical Care, Bhubaneswar 751007, India.', 'Sparsh Hospital and Critical Care, Bhubaneswar 751007, India.', 'Lab Care and Diagnostics, Cuttack 753007, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Bhubaneswar 751023, India.

30725925,,Publisher,,,,,2022 Jan,ITP-Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura,,,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune pathology characterized by a low platelet count, purpura, and hemorrhagic episodes caused by antiplatelet autoantibodies. The diagnosis is typically made by the exclusion of the known causes of thrombocytopenia. IgG autoantibodies sensitize the circulating platelets. It leads to accelerated removal of these cells by antigen-presenting cells (macrophages) of the spleen, and sometimes the liver or other components of the monocyte-macrophage system. Bone marrow compensates the platelet destruction by increasing platelet production. ITP most often occurs in healthy children and young adults within a few weeks following a viral infection. ITP is usually manageable with immunosuppressive therapy.[1][2] An identical form of autoimmune thrombocytopenia can also be associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, SLE, infectious mononucleosis, and other bacterial and viral infections. Certain drugs can also cause immune thrombocytopenia indistinguishable from ITP. Most children have spontaneous remission within a few weeks or months, and splenectomy is rarely needed. However, young adults rarely have spontaneous remissions necessitating splenectomy within the first few months after diagnosis.","['Justiz Vaillant, Angel A.', 'Gupta, Nagendra']","['Justiz Vaillant AA', 'Gupta N']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,2019/02/07 06:01,2019/02/07 06:01,,,['NBK537240 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,20190207,['20211205'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2019/02/07 06:01'],

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder of B or T cell origin. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2017 classification system categorizes these disease entities under precursor lymphoid neoplasm. The WHO 2017 classification of precursor lymphoid neoplasm includes 4 distinct entities: B-ALL/LBL not otherwise specified (NOS); B-ALL/LBL with recurrent genetic abnormalities; T-ALL/LBL; and NK-ALL/LBL. Lymphoblasts are the characteristic cells of this disease entity. The lymphoblasts are usually small to medium-sized with scant cytoplasm, moderately condensed to dispersed chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. The lymphoblasts traditionally involve the bone marrow (BM) and/or blood in ALL and involve the lymph nodes in LBL. The diagnosis is of ALL is rendered when the blast count exceeds 20%. Occasionally, patients present with primary lymph node involvement of nodal or extranodal sites (LBL). Sometimes, there is an overlap between ALL and LBL, and it has been widely accepted to render a combined diagnosis. NK-ALL/LBL is currently a provisional entity in the WHO 2017 classification. It is a rare entity, and diagnosis often overlaps with T-ALL/LBL. ALL is one of the earliest neoplasms where chemotherapeutic treatment showed a favorable outcome. It has also been one of the earliest neoplastic disease entities where the understanding of biology has led to direct changes in the management of patients.[1][2]","['Kaseb, Hatem', 'Tariq, Muhammad Ali', 'Gupta, Gunjan']","['Kaseb H', 'Tariq MA', 'Gupta G']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,2019/02/07 06:01,2019/02/07 06:01,,,['NBK537237 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,20190207,['20210824'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2019/02/07 06:01'],

These diseases often occur in immunocompromised individuals. There are two subsets of lymphocytes: T and B cells that regenerate uncontrollably to produce immunoproliferative disorders, which are prone to immunodeficiency, a dysfunctional immune system, and lymphocyte dysregulation. Several gene mutations have been described as causes of LPD that can be iatrogenic or acquired. The X-linked LPD is characterized by a mutation in the X chromosome that predisposes to natural killer cell LPD and T-cell LPD. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a type of LPD caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for a Fas protein which is located in the long arm of chromosome 10. Males with X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome are susceptible to LPD and at risk for acquiring EBV and further development of lymphoma. Individuals with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Chediak-Higashi syndrome and viral infections including HIV, are also prone to LPD. Others at risk include patients undergoing tissue transplantation and the use of immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin, sirolimus, and tacrolimus. Invasive fungal infections have also been linked to this pathology.[3] Chronic lymphoproliferative disorders are immuno-morphologically and clinically heterogeneous. Common features of these processes include various immunophenotypes (T, B, and NK cells) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase negativity. The B-cell lymphocytic disorders include B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including mantle cell lymphoma) in leukemic phase, hairy cell leukemia and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes. The T-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders include Sezary syndrome, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, and large granulated lymphocyte leukemia.[4]","['Justiz Vaillant, Angel A.', 'Stang, Christopher M.']","['Justiz Vaillant AA', 'Stang CM']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,2019/02/07 06:01,2019/02/07 06:01,,,['NBK537162 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,20190207,['20211015'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2019/02/07 06:01'],

30725636,,Publisher,,,,,2022 Jan,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,,,"Bone marrow transplant (hematopoietic stem cell transplant) (HPSCT) involves the administration of healthy hematopoietic stem cells in patients with dysfunctional or depleted bone marrow. This helps to augment bone marrow function and allows, depending on the disease being treated, to either destroy tumor cells with malignancy or to generate functional cells that can replace the dysfunctional ones in cases like immune deficiency syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, and other diseases. History and Evolution Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was first explored in humans in the 1950s and was based on observational studies in mice models which showed that infusion of healthy bone marrow components into a myelosuppressed bone marrow could induce recovery of its function in the recipient.[1] These animal-based studies soon found their clinical application into humans when the first successful bone marrow transplant was performed in monozygotic twins in New York in 1957 (syngeneic transplant) in a patient with acute leukemia.[2] As a result, the physician Dr. Thomas who performed the procedure continued his research on the development of bone marrow transplantation and later received the Nobel Prize of physiology and medicine in appreciation of his work. The first successful allogeneic bone marrow transplant was reported in Minnesota in 1968 for a pediatric patient with severe, combined immunodeficiency syndrome.[3] Since then, allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplant has increased in the United States and worldwide. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) reported over 8000 allogenic transplants performed in the United States in 2016 with a higher number of autologous transplants with a steady and higher increase of autologous compared to allogenic.[4] Definitions Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) The group of genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 (p6) that encodes human leukocyte antigens (HLA) which are considered being highly polymorphic leading to a large difference in the resultant expressed proteins on human cells. They are divided into MHC I and MHC II Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) These are the proteins expressed on the cellular surface and play an important role in alloimmunity. HLA can be divided into (HLA-A, B, and C) which are encoded by class I MHC and are expressed on all cell types and present peptides derived from the cytoplasm and are recognized by CD8+ T cells. The other HLA type is classified as (HLA- DP, DQ, and DR) which are encoded by MHC II and can be found on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and this class is recognized by CD4+ T cells. Syngeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation The donor and the recipient are identical twins. The advantages include no graft versus host disease (GVHD) and no graft failure. However, only a tiny number of transplant patients will have the ability to have an identical twin for transplantation. Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation The bone marrow products are collected from the patient and are reinfused after purification methods. The advantages include no GVHD. The disadvantage is that the bone marrow products may contain abnormal cells that can cause relapse in the case of malignancy hence; theoretically, this method cannot be used in all cases of abnormal bone marrow diseases. Allogenic Transplantation The donor is an HLA matched family member, unrelated matched donor or mismatched family donors (haploidentical). Engraftment The process of which infused transplanted hematopoietic stem cells produce mature progeny in the peripheral circulation Preparative Regimen This is a regimen that comprises high-dose chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation (TBI) which are administered to the recipient prior to stem cell infusion to eliminate the largest number of malignant cells and to allow for immunosuppression in the recipient so that engraftment can occur.","['Khaddour, Karam', 'Hana, Caroline K.', 'Mewawalla, Prerna']","['Khaddour K', 'Hana CK', 'Mewawalla P']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,2019/02/07 06:01,2019/02/07 06:01,,,['NBK536951 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,20190207,['20210725'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2019/02/07 06:01'],

The labs are based on the use of the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line, a model system that is exceptionally amenable to an undergraduate cell biology lab course due to its ease of maintenance and propagation and usefulness for studies of growth, death, and differentiation. The sequence of labs is conducted over a 6-week period, following a series of weekly cell biology labs covering basic cell and molecular biology techniques. Together, the lab series has four primary objectives 1) to teach students how to culture and maintain mammalian cells; 2) to build student competency in standard cell biology techniques; 3) to demonstrate the role of growth factors on cell proliferation and viability; and 4) to provide students with an opportunity to use these cells in an independent investigation on cell differentiation. We provide examples of student data and offer a range of experimental measurements depending on institutional capacity and facilities. Our assessment data suggest that students find great value in this lab series, enhancing their comprehension of key concepts, acquisition of important lab skills, and depth of understanding of the research process.

The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax demonstrated activity as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy or HMA in AML. In this case series, patients with secondary AML (sAML) not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and refractory to HMA were treated with venetoclax within a named patient program at our tertiary cancer center in Salzburg, Austria. Between April 2017 and September 2018, seven patients with sAML received venetoclax therapy. Two out of seven patients achieved a complete remission upon venetoclax initiation with a PFS of 505 days and 352 days and another patient achieved complete peripheral blood blast clearing within nine days after start of venetoclax. Among the venetoclax responders, primary refractory disease to prior HMA therapy was documented, 2 patients harbored IDH1/IDH2 mutations and one patient had an antecedent myeloproliferative neoplasm. High BCL-2 and/or BIM expression in myeloblasts was found in venetoclax responders and response was significantly associated with overall survival (responders: 364 days versus non-responders: 24 days, P = 0.018).

Fludarabine enhances the efficacy of Ara-C (cytarabine) by increasing intracellular Ara-C-triphosphate. The FLAG (fludarabine, high-dose Ara-C, supported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) regimen has been tested for use in AML patients by other investigators. In the phase II study reported here, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of FLAGM therapy (FLAG with mitoxantrone), further intensified by adding mitoxantrone, based on the results of a phase I study by our group. The major endpoints were complete remission (CR) rate and early death. From June 2004 to February 2008, 41 patients (median age 52 years; range 18-64 years) were enrolled. Thirty (73% 95% CI 58-84%) patients achieved CR, which met the primary endpoint; there was a single case of early death from pneumonia. Two-year overall survival was 39.4% (95% CI 25.2-55.6%). Of those who achieved CR, 27 underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), and 12 SCT recipients showed long-term survival. Grade 3/4 non-hematological adverse events included infection (59%), nausea/vomiting (15%), diarrhea (7%), and elevated liver enzymes (7%). In conclusion, FLAGM is an effective and safe salvage therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory AML, and facilitated SCT for a large proportion of patients.","['Hatsumi, Nahoko', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Usui, Noriko', 'Arai, Yukihiro', 'Ishida, Fumihiro', 'Morii, Takeshi', 'Kano, Yasuhiko', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Machida, Shinichiro', 'Nishii, Kazuhiro', 'Honda, Sumihisa', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Hatsumi N', 'Miyawaki S', 'Yamauchi T', 'Takeshita A', 'Komatsu N', 'Usui N', 'Arai Y', 'Ishida F', 'Morii T', 'Kano Y', 'Ogura M', 'Machida S', 'Nishii K', 'Honda S', 'Ohnishi K', 'Naoe T']","['Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan. miyawaki@mail.wind.ne.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minamiohtsuka Toshima-ku, Tokyo, 170-8476, Japan. miyawaki@mail.wind.ne.jp.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Mibu, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nara Medical University, Nara, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tochigi Cancer Center, Utsunomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya Daini Red Cross Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kasugai Municipal Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Public Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Oncology Center, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190206,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02606-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02606-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Apr;109(4):418-425. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02606-0.

However, complement exhaustion and overexpression of complement inhibitors by cancer cells diminish their therapeutic potential. The strategies of targeting membrane complement inhibitors by function-blocking antibodies and the supplementation with fresh frozen plasma have been proposed to overcome tumour cell resistance. We present a novel approach, which utilizes gain-of-function variants of complement factor B (FB), a component of alternative C3/C5 convertases, which augment mAb-activated reactions through a positive feedback mechanism called an amplification loop. If complement concentration is limited, an addition of quadruple gain-of-function FB mutant p.D279G p.F286L p.K323E p.Y363A (or selected single mutants) results in significantly increased complement-mediated lysis of ofatumumab-resistant tumour cells, as well as the complete lysis of moderately sensitive cells. Importantly, this effect cannot be achieved by further increasing ofatumumab concentration. Potentiation of cytotoxic effect towards moderately sensitive cells was less apparent at physiological serum concentration. However, an addition of hyperactive FB could compensate the loss of cytotoxic potential of serum collected from the NHL and CLL patients after infusion of rituximab. Residual levels of rituximab in such sera, in combination with added FB, were able to efficiently lyse tumour cells. We suggest that the administration of gain-of-function variants of FB can restore cytotoxic potential of complement-exhausted serum and maximize the therapeutic effect of circulating anti-CD20 mAbs.","['Felberg, Anna', 'Urban, Aleksandra', 'Borowska, Anna', 'Stasilojc, Grzegorz', 'Taszner, Michal', 'Hellmann, Andrzej', 'Blom, Anna Maria', 'Okroj, Marcin']","['Felberg A', 'Urban A', 'Borowska A', 'Stasilojc G', 'Taszner M', 'Hellmann A', 'Blom AM', 'Okroj M']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki 1 Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki 1 Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki 1 Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki 1 Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki 1 Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland. marcin.okroj@gumed.edu.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190206,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,PMC6447516,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-019-02304-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-019-02304-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2019 Apr;68(4):587-598. doi: 10.1007/s00262-019-02304-0.

Patients with NF1 have an increased cancer risk and mortality, but there are no population-based cohort studies specifically investigating the risk of childhood malignancies. We used the Finnish NF1 cohort to analyze the incidence, risk and prognosis of malignancies in NF1 patients <20 years of age. Persons born in 1987-2011 were included, and 524 persons were followed through the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry from birth up to age 20 years. This amounted to 8,376 person years. Fifty-three patients had cancer <20 years of age, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 35.6. The most frequent location of pediatric cancers was the central nervous system (CNS); there were 45 cases and the SIR was 115.7. Exclusion of 22 optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) gave an SIR of 59.1 for the CNS and 21.6 for all cancers. There were nine malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs); their cumulative risk was 2.7% by age 20. No cases of leukemia were observed. NF1 patients showed considerable excess mortality with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 73.1. The survival of NF1 patients with CNS tumors other than OPGs did not differ from that of non-NF1 controls (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.76). In conclusion, brain tumors in childhood and MPNSTs in adolescence are malignancies of major concern in patients with NF1. The risk for myeloid malignancies may not be as high as suggested in the literature.","['Peltonen, Sirkku', 'Kallionpaa, Roope A', 'Rantanen, Matti', 'Uusitalo, Elina', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Poyhonen, Minna', 'Pitkaniemi, Janne', 'Peltonen, Juha']","['Peltonen S', 'Kallionpaa RA', 'Rantanen M', 'Uusitalo E', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Poyhonen M', 'Pitkaniemi J', 'Peltonen J']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Dermatology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Finnish Cancer Registry - Institute for Statistical and Epidemiological Cancer Research, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, HUSLAB, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Finnish Cancer Registry - Institute for Statistical and Epidemiological Cancer Research, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190218,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,PMC6849871,,2019/02/07 06:00,2020/02/01 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32187 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Dec 1;145(11):2926-2932. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32187.

Accordingly, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy aims to reduce the progression of emphysema, as achieved by life-long weekly slow-drip infusions of plasma-derived affinity-purified human AAT. However, not all AATD patients will receive this therapy, due to either lack of medical coverage or low patient compliance. To circumvent these limitations, attempts are being made to develop lung-directed therapies, including inhaled AAT and locally-delivered AAT gene therapy. Lung transplantation is also an ultimate therapy option. Although less common, AATD patients also present with disease manifestations that extend beyond the lung, including vasculitis, diabetes and panniculitis, and appear to experience longer and more frequent hospitalization times and more frequent pneumonia bouts. In the past decade, new mechanism-based clinical indications for AAT therapy have surfaced, depicting a safe, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue-protective agent. Introduced to non-AATD individuals, AAT appears to provide relief from steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, from bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis and from autoimmune diabetes; preclinical studies show benefit also in multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury and aberrant wound healing processes. While the current augmentation therapy is targeted towards treatment of emphysema, it is suggested that AATD patients may benefit from AAT augmentation therapy geared towards extrapulmonary pathologies as well. Thus, development of mechanism-based, context-specific AAT augmentation therapy protocols is encouraged. In the current review, we will discuss extrapulmonary manifestations of AATD and the potential of AAT augmentation therapy for these conditions.","['Baranovski, Boris M', 'Schuster, Ronen', 'Nisim, Omer', 'Brami, Ido', 'Lior, Yotam', 'Lewis, Eli C']","['Baranovski BM', 'Schuster R', 'Nisim O', 'Brami I', 'Lior Y', 'Lewis EC']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180919,United States,Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Miami, Fla.)",101635411,PMC6361480,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/02/07 06:01,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15326/jcopdf.5.4.2017.0161 [doi]'],epublish,Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis. 2018 Sep 19;5(4):267-276. doi: 10.15326/jcopdf.5.4.2017.0161.,['NOTNLM'],"['autoimmunity', 'bone-marrow transplantation', 'cell survival', 'diabetes', 'immune system', 'inflammation', 'leukemia', 'organ transplantation', 'ulcerative colitis', 'wound healing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intriguingly, CLL B cells share phenotypical characteristics with regulatory B (Breg) cells suggesting that they might negatively control the T-cell activation and immune responses. We elaborated an in vitro co-culture system with T cells to evaluate the Breg capacities of CLL B cells following innate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. We demonstrated that B cells from half of the patients exhibited regulatory capacities, whilst B cells from the remaining patients were unable to develop a Breg function. The T cell sensitivities of all patients were normal suggesting that defective Breg activities were due to intrinsic CLL B cell deficiencies. Thus, TLR-dedicated gene assays highlighted differential signature of the TLR9 negative regulation pathway between the two groups of patients. Furthermore, correlations of the doubling time of lymphocytosis, the time to first treatment, the mutational status of IgVH and the Breg functions indicate that patients with efficient Breg activities have more aggressive CLL than patients with defective Breg cells. Our in vitro observations may open new approaches for adjusting therapeutic strategies targeting the Breg along with the evolution of the disease.","['Mohr, Audrey', 'Cumin, Marie', 'Bagacean, Cristina', 'Pochard, Pierre', 'Le Dantec, Christelle', 'Hillion, Sophie', 'Renaudineau, Yves', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Saad, Hussam', 'Pers, Jacques-Olivier', 'Bordron, Anne', 'Jamin, Christophe']","['Mohr A', 'Cumin M', 'Bagacean C', 'Pochard P', 'Le Dantec C', 'Hillion S', 'Renaudineau Y', 'Berthou C', 'Tempescul A', 'Saad H', 'Pers JO', 'Bordron A', 'Jamin C']","['UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Immunotherapie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France."", 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Immunotherapie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France."", 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Immunotherapie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France."", 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Immunotherapie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France."", 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France."", 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France."", 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', 'UMR1227, Lymphocytes B et Autoimmunite, Univ Brest, INSERM, Brest, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Immunotherapie, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181212,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC6350696,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/02/07 06:01,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1554968 [doi]', '1554968 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Dec 12;8(3):1554968. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1554968. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aggressiveness', '*B cells', '*CLL', '*Regulatory capacity', '*TLR9']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3354-0981', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9494-3223']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only in vitro but also in early phase clinical trials, zoledronic acid (Zol) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been successfully used to activate human gammadelta T-cells and to induce clinical anti-tumor effects. Aiming to improve the effectiveness of future gammadelta T-cell based immunotherapies against leukemia, we analyzed the impact of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) signaling, on the different phases of gammadelta T-cell activation, of proliferation, production of anti-tumor cytokines and cytotoxic function in vitro. PD-1 expression was found significantly upregulated between day 2 and day 4 following stimulation with Zol and IL-2. However, proliferation or expression of activation markers of gammadelta, alphabeta and NK-cells are not altered by additional PD-1 blockade. Pembrolizumab increases interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in gammadelta T-cells upon direct stimulation with Zol and in response to Zol treated primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells by approximately 57% and 30%, respectively. Zol sensitized primary AML cells also induce PD-1 expression in co-cultured gammadelta T-cells and such PD-1(+) cells contain more IFN-gamma. In contrast, PD-1 blockade does not have a significant effect on direct cell dependent lysis of leukemia cells by gammadelta T-cells. This study demonstrates that PD-1 blockade impacts cell dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine production in response to leukemia cells differently. While Pembrolizumab did not increase cell lysis of stimulated and expanded gammadelta T-cells, it induces significant upregulation of the potent pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor cytokine IFN-gamma, which might facilitate anti-leukemia effects.","['Hoeres, Timm', 'Holzmann, Elisabeth', 'Smetak, Manfred', 'Birkmann, Josef', 'Wilhelm, Martin']","['Hoeres T', 'Holzmann E', 'Smetak M', 'Birkmann J', 'Wilhelm M']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181214,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC6350692,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/02/07 06:01,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1550618 [doi]', '1550618 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Dec 14;8(3):1550618. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1550618. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*IL-2', '*PD-1', '*Pembrolizumab', '*T-cell', '*gamma delta', '*leukemia', '*zoledronic acid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multifactorial etiology, including immune dysregulation, infections, chronic inflammation, or genetic background, is suggested to contribute to tumor development. Here, we present the results of the first Czech nationwide study focused on epidemiology, immunology and genetic background in a cohort of CVID patients who also developed tumors Methods: The cohort consisted of 295 CVID patients followed for 3,070 patient/years. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated to determine the risk of cancer, and Risk ratio (RR) was established to evaluate the significance of comorbidities. Moreover, immunophenotyping, including immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte populations, was assessed. Finally, Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in all patients with lymphoma to investigate the genetic background. Results: Twenty-five malignancies were diagnosed in 22 patients in a cohort of 295 CVID patients. SIR was more than 6 times greater in comparison to the general population. The most common neoplasias were gastric cancers and lymphomas. History of Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was established as a potential risk factor, with over 3 times higher risk of cancer development. The B cell count at diagnosis of lymphoma was reduced in the lymphoma group; moreover, post-treatment B and T cell lymphopenia, associated with poorer outcome, was found in a majority of the patients. Intriguingly, no NK cell depression was observed after the chemotherapy. WES revealed heterogeneous genetic background among CVID patients with tumors, identifying gene variants associated with primary immunodeficiencies (such as CTLA4, PIK3CD, PMS2) and/or increased cancer susceptibility (including BRCA1, RABEP1, EP300, KDM5A). Conclusions: The incidence of malignancy in our CVID cohort was found to be more than 6 times greater compared to the general population. Gastric cancers and lymphomas were the most frequently diagnosed tumors. ITP was identified as a risk factor for malignancy in CVID patients. WES analysis confirmed a wide genetic heterogeneity among CVID patients. The identified causative or modifying gene variants pointed to errors in mechanisms contributing to both immunodeficiency and malignancy.","['Kralickova, Pavlina', 'Milota, Tomas', 'Litzman, Jiri', 'Malkusova, Ivana', 'Jilek, Dalibor', 'Petanova, Jitka', 'Vydlakova, Jana', 'Zimulova, Alena', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Svaton, Michael', 'Kanderova, Veronika', 'Bloomfield, Marketa', 'Parackova, Zuzana', 'Klocperk, Adam', 'Haviger, Jiri', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Sediva, Anna']","['Kralickova P', 'Milota T', 'Litzman J', 'Malkusova I', 'Jilek D', 'Petanova J', 'Vydlakova J', 'Zimulova A', 'Fronkova E', 'Svaton M', 'Kanderova V', 'Bloomfield M', 'Parackova Z', 'Klocperk A', 'Haviger J', 'Kalina T', 'Sediva A']","['Department of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', ""Department of Allergology nad Clinical Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University and St Anne's University Hospital in Brno, Brno, Czechia."", 'Department of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University and University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Department of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Institute of Health, Usti nad Labem, Czechia.', 'Institute of Immunology and Microbiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Pneumology, Regional Thomas Bata Hospital, Zlin, Czechia.', 'Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Informatics and Quantitative Methods, Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czechia.', 'Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czechia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC6349737,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03135 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jan 22;9:3135. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03135. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*common variable immunodeficiency', '*gastric cancer', '*lymphoma', '*malignancy', '*whole exome sequencing']",,,,,,20191017,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Common Variable Immunodeficiency/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Czech Republic/epidemiology', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Young Adult']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, clinical L-Asparaginase formulations are derived from bacterial sources such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. These formulations when administered to ALL patients lead to several immunological and hypersensitive reactions. Hence, additional purification steps are required to remove toxicity induced by the amalgamation of other enzymes like glutaminase and urease. Production of L-Asparaginase that is free of glutaminase and urease is a major area of research. In this paper, we report the screening and isolation of fungal species collected from the soil and mosses in the Schirmacher Hills, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, that produce L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. A total of 55 isolates were obtained from 33 environmental samples that were tested by conventional plate techniques using Phenol red and Bromothymol blue as indicators. Among the isolated fungi, 30 isolates showed L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. The L-Asparaginase producing strain Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1, which showed the highest zone index, was then optimized with a Taguchi design. Optimum enzyme activity of 20.57 U mL(-1) was obtained at a temperature of 30 degrees C and pH of 7.0 after 60 hours. Our work suggests that isolation of fungi from extreme environments such as Antarctica may lead to an important advancement in therapeutic applications with fewer side effects.","['Ashok, Anup', 'Doriya, Kruthi', 'Rao, Jyothi Vithal', 'Qureshi, Asif', 'Tiwari, Anoop Kumar', 'Kumar, Devarai Santhosh']","['Ashok A', 'Doriya K', 'Rao JV', 'Qureshi A', 'Tiwari AK', 'Kumar DS']","['Industrial Bioprocess and Bioprospecting Laboratory (IBBL), Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, Telangana State, 502285, India.', 'Industrial Bioprocess and Bioprospecting Laboratory (IBBL), Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, Telangana State, 502285, India.', 'Industrial Bioprocess and Bioprospecting Laboratory (IBBL), Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, Telangana State, 502285, India.', 'Emerging Contaminants Group (ECG), Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, Telangana State, 502285, India.', 'National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Vasco da Gama, Goa, 403804, India.', 'Industrial Bioprocess and Bioprospecting Laboratory (IBBL), Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, Telangana State, 502285, India. devarai@iith.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190205,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6363723,,2019/02/07 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-38094-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-38094-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Feb 5;9(1):1423. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-38094-1.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3329-0166', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9968-2758', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5298-0926']",,,20200911,IM,"['Agaricales/enzymology/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Antarctic Regions', 'Asparaginase/*biosynthesis/therapeutic use', 'Bryophyta/*microbiology', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Glutaminase/*metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Soil Microbiology', 'Trichosporon/*enzymology/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Urease/*metabolism']","['0 (DNA, Fungal)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)', 'EC 3.5.1.5 (Urease)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methylation profiling has provided a new tier of investigation to gain insight into the origin and behavior of B-cell malignancies; however, the methylation profile of HCL has not been specifically investigated. DNA methylation profiling was analyzed with the Infinium HumanMethylation27 array in 41 mature B-cell tumors, including 11 HCL, 7 splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZLs), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with an unmutated (n = 7) or mutated (n = 6) immunoglobulin gene heavy chain variable (IGHV) region or using IGHV3-21 (n = 10). Methylation profiles of nontumor B-cell subsets and gene expression profiling data were obtained from public databases. HCL had a methylation signature distinct from each B-cell tumor entity, including the closest entity, SMZL. Comparison with normal B-cell subsets revealed the strongest similarity with postgerminal center (GC) B cells and a clear separation from pre-GC and GC cellular programs. Comparison of the integrated analysis with post-GC B cells revealed significant hypomethylation and overexpression of BCR-TLR-NF-kappaB and BRAF-MAPK signaling pathways and cell adhesion, as well as hypermethylation and underexpression of cell-differentiation markers and methylated genes in cancer, suggesting regulation of the transformed hairy cells through specific components of the B-cell receptor and the BRAF signaling pathways. Our data identify a specific methylation profile of HCL, which may help to distinguish it from other mature B-cell tumors.","['Arribas, Alberto J', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Chiodin, Giorgia', 'Kwee, Ivo', 'Mensah, Afua Adjeiwaa', 'Cascione, Luciano', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Kanduri, Meena', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Johnson, Peter W', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Forconi, Francesco']","['Arribas AJ', 'Rinaldi A', 'Chiodin G', 'Kwee I', 'Mensah AA', 'Cascione L', 'Rossi D', 'Kanduri M', 'Rosenquist R', 'Zucca E', 'Johnson PW', 'Gaidano G', 'Oakes CC', 'Bertoni F', 'Forconi F']","['Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Manno, Switzerland.', 'Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery, and Neuroscience, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; and.', 'Haematology Department, Cancer Care, Southampton University Hospital Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6373742,,2019/02/07 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018024059 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024059 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Feb 12;3(3):384-396. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024059.,,,['C34999/A18087/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4606-0637', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5637-8983', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2211-1831']",,,20200203,IM,"['*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hereditary nature of these diseases often goes unrecognized, particularly when symptoms begin in adulthood. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. RESULTS: Many rare germline mutations have been identified that lead to acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. They differ from one another with respect to their penetrance, the age of onset of disease, and the clinical manifestations. In view of this heterogeneity, no uniform recommendations have yet been formulated for their diagnosis and treatment. The most common types of hematological malig- nancy with a hereditary predisposition are traceable to an underlying disturbance of DNA damage response and repair mechanisms and to mutations of hematological transcription factors. With regard to the selection of patients for testing, the con- sensus is that cytogenetic and molecular-genetic findings that are suspect for a hereditary predisposition, such as CEBPA and RUNX1 mutations, call for further investigation, as do any clinical features that are typical of tumor syndromes, or a positive family history. The knowledge that a hereditary predisposition may be present is highly stressful for patients; testing should only be carried out after the patient has received genetic counseling. The confirmation of a germline mutation always requires a comparison with healthy tissue. A fibroblast culture is recom- mended as the gold standard for this purpose. CONCLUSION: The detection of a hereditary predisposition to hematological neoplasia is often relevant to treatment and follow-up care: for example, it may motivate early allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Counseling, predictive testing, and follow-up care are available to the patients' relatives as well.","['Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Haag, Georg-Martin', 'Schott, Sarah', 'Kloor, Matthias', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Bochtler T', 'Haag GM', 'Schott S', 'Kloor M', 'Kramer A', 'Muller-Tidow C']","[""Department of Internal Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, Heidelberg University Hospital and Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Internal Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; Section Head of Translational Gynecology, University Women's Hospital Heidelberg, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Pathology, Department of Applied Tumor Biology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,PMC6375069,,2019/02/07 06:00,2019/08/15 06:00,['2019/02/07 06:00'],"['2017/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2018.0848 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2018.0848 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2018 Dec 14;115(50):848-854. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2018.0848.,,,,,,,,20190814,,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Genetic Counseling/methods', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,,,,"['Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2019 Apr 5;116(14):251.

METHODS: The study involved 35 pediatric patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), from March 2014 to December 2016. Serologic markers used for the analysis of cardiac dysfunction were troponin T, NT-proBNP and PCRhs. Also, the patients have had echocardiographic evaluation at the beginning of treatment to determine LVEF, SF and A, E, E' Doppler waves. RESULTS: Positive linear correlation was shown between NT-proBNP and leukocyte values, NT-proBNP and blast cells value, and NT-proBNP and LDH. Significant linear negative correlations between LVEF with leukocyte values, blast cells values, LDH, SF and leukocyte values, LVEF and NT-proBNP values and LVEF and troponin T values were also identified. A weak negative correlation between E/E' ratio and blast cells values has been observed. All of these correlations were statistically significant (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte value, as well as the other serological markers assessed (NT-proBNP, Troponin T), are useful tools to evaluate the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. The variation of the biological markers at the beginning of the cytotoxic treatment confirms the presence of an early myocardial dysfunction, emphasizing the importance of systematic evaluation of this particular group of patients.","['Raluca Maniu, Diana', 'Blag, Cristina', 'Popa, Gheorghe', 'Bota, Madalina', 'Vlad, Catalin', 'Cainap, Calin', 'Balacescu, Ovidiu', 'Pop, Laura', 'Cainap, Simona Sorana']","['Raluca Maniu D', 'Blag C', 'Popa G', 'Bota M', 'Vlad C', 'Cainap C', 'Balacescu O', 'Pop L', 'Cainap SS']","['Emergency County Hospital for Children, Pediatric Clinic no 2, Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2018 Dec;23(7):122-131.,,,,,,,,20190820,,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Cardiotoxicity/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Troponin T/metabolism']","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine how Mlh1 dysfunction promotes lymphoma as well as the influence of ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, we used an Mlh1-/- mouse model and whole-exome sequencing to assess genomic alterations in 23 T-cell lymphomas, including 8 spontaneous and 15 IR-associated lymphomas. Exposure to IR accelerated T-cell lymphoma induction in the Mlh1-/- mice, and whole-exome sequencing revealed that IR exposure neither increased the number of mutations nor altered the mutation spectrum of the lymphomas. Frequent mutations were evident in genes encoding transcription factors (e.g. Ikzf1, Trp53, Bcl11b), epigenetic regulators (e.g. Suv420h1, Ep300, Kmt2d), transporters (e.g. Rangap1, Kcnj16), extracellular matrix (e.g. Megf6, Lrig1), cell motility (e.g. Argef19, Dnah17), protein kinase cascade (e.g. Ptpro, Marcks) and in genes involved in NOTCH (e.g. Notch1), and PI3K/AKT (e.g. Pten, Akt2) signaling pathways in both spontaneous and IR-associated lymphomas. Frameshift mutations in mononucleotide repeat sequences within the genes Trp53, Ep300, Kmt2d, Notch1, Pten and Marcks were newly identified in the lymphomas. The lymphomas also exhibited a few chromosomal abnormalities. The results establish a landscape of genomic alterations in spontaneous and IR-associated lymphomas that occur in the context of mismatch repair dysfunction and suggest potential targets for cancer treatment.","['Daino, Kazuhiro', 'Ishikawa, Atsuko', 'Suga, Tomo', 'Amasaki, Yoshiko', 'Kodama, Yotaro', 'Shang, Yi', 'Hirano-Sakairi, Shinobu', 'Nishimura, Mayumi', 'Nakata, Akifumi', 'Yoshida, Mitsuaki', 'Imai, Takashi', 'Shimada, Yoshiya', 'Kakinuma, Shizuko']","['Daino K', 'Ishikawa A', 'Suga T', 'Amasaki Y', 'Kodama Y', 'Shang Y', 'Hirano-Sakairi S', 'Nishimura M', 'Nakata A', 'Yoshida M', 'Imai T', 'Shimada Y', 'Kakinuma S']","['Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences for Radiation Damages, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University of Science, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Emergency Medicine, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Medical Databank Section, Hospital, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'QST, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['5306484 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgz013 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2019 Apr 29;40(2):216-224. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgz013.,,,,,,,,20191206,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Frameshift Mutation/*genetics', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1/*genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']","['0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mlh1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Associations between serum OC pesticide and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common subtype of acute leukemia in adult populations, have not been evaluated prospectively in the general population. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the risk of AML in relation to pre-diagnostic serum levels of OC pesticides and PCBs in a case-control study nested within the Janus Serum Bank Cohort. METHODS: Janus is a large population-based cohort containing biologic samples collected beginning in the early 1970s from ~318,000 individuals in Norway. Serum levels of 11 OC pesticides or their metabolites and 34 PCB congeners were measured in 56 AML cases and 288 controls. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to evaluate associations between lipid-adjusted serum OC levels and risk of AML. RESULTS: Higher serum levels of total chlordane/heptachlor metabolites were associated with AML risk (3rd vs. 1st tertile odds ratio (OR)=2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.91-5.63; ptrend=0.11). Significant exposure-response associations were observed for levels of heptachlor epoxide (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR=2.85, 95% CI=1.05-7.73; ptrend=0.02) and dieldrin (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR=2.71, 95% CI=1.07-6.83; ptrend=0.03). No significant exposure-response associations with AML risk were observed for total DDT or individual isomers and derivatives. Higher serum levels of p,p'-DDT showed a non-significant increase in risk, but the exposure-response became attenuated when co-adjusting for heptachlor epoxide or dieldrin levels. Serum PCB levels were not significantly associated with AML risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that higher serum levels of dieldrin and metabolites derived from chlordane/heptachlor are associated with risk of AML in the general Norwegian population, based on samples collected on average ~17years before diagnosis. Further research in populations with historically high or recent exposure to DDT is warranted to assess the association with AML risk with body burden of specific DDT isomers and derivatives.","['Bassig, Bryan A', 'Engel, Lawrence S', 'Langseth, Hilde', 'Grimsrud, Tom K', 'Cantor, Kenneth P', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Purdue, Mark P', 'Barr, Dana Boyd', 'Wong, Jason Y Y', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Lan, Qing']","['Bassig BA', 'Engel LS', 'Langseth H', 'Grimsrud TK', 'Cantor KP', 'Vermeulen R', 'Purdue MP', 'Barr DB', 'Wong JYY', 'Blair A', 'Rothman N', 'Lan Q']","['Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.

The interaction between thiazolidine based phenanthrene 8 and serum albumins (HSA and BSA), transport proteins, has also been explored which shows quenching of fluorescence through static mechanism. The thermodynamic parameters, obtained from van't Hoff relationship indicate the prevalence of hydrogen-bonding/hydrophobic interactions for the binding phenomenon.","['Singh, Iqubal', 'Rani, Richa', 'Luxami, Vijay', 'Paul, Kamaldeep']","['Singh I', 'Rani R', 'Luxami V', 'Paul K']","['School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala 147 001, India.', 'School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala 147 001, India.', 'School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala 147 001, India.', 'School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala 147 001, India.

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to describe and supplement limited PK data in the pediatric population ranging from 2 to less than 6 years of age and ultimately inform dosing regimen. An adult Simcyp PBPK model was established and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data after a single or multiple oral doses of 400 mg nilotinib (230 mg/m(2)). The model was then applied to a pediatric PBPK model, taking account of ontogeny profiles of metabolizing enzymes and pediatric physiological parameters. The model was further verified using observed pediatric PK data in 12- to <18-year-old and from 6- to <12-year-old patients. The PBPK models were able to recover, describe, and supplement the limited nilotinib concentration-time data profile in 2- to <6-year-old patients after a single dose and Cmin,ss after BID dosing. The exposure (Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUCtau,ss) was predicted to be similar across age groups. PBPK model simulations confirmed that body surface area-normalized dosing regimen of 230 mg/m(2) is considered appropriate for pediatric patients >2 to <18 years of age.","['Heimbach, Tycho', 'Lin, Wen', 'Hourcade-Potelleret, Florence', 'Tian, Xianbin', 'Combes, Francois Pierre', 'Horvath, Nicholas', 'He, Handan']","['Heimbach T', 'Lin W', 'Hourcade-Potelleret F', 'Tian X', 'Combes FP', 'Horvath N', 'He H']","['Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, PK Sciences, East Hanover, New Jersey 07936.

Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246). Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 signalling in cells expressing FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), tyrosine kinase domain mutation FLT3-D835Y and the double mutant FLT3-ITD-D835Y, thereby inducing apoptosis. Gilteritinib also binds to and inhibits the wild-type and mutated forms of ALK, resulting in reduced tumour cell proliferation in cancer cell types that overexpress the mutation. Gilteritinib is approved in Japan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. Recently, it was also approved in the USA for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory AML with a FLT3 mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. Clinical development of gilteritinib is underway in several countries worldwide. Development for non-small cell lung cancer and solid tumours has been discontinued.","['Dhillon, Sohita']",['Dhillon S'],"['Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland, 0754, New Zealand. dru@adis.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40265-019-1062-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s40265-019-1062-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2019 Feb;79(3):331-339. doi: 10.1007/s40265-019-1062-3.,,,,,,,,20191004,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Approval', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']","['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription factor OCT-4 regulates various pathways in stem cells, but its expression can be regulated by pseudogenes. This work evaluated how OCT4-PG1 pseudogene can affect OCT-4 expression and mechanisms related to the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in FEPS cells. Considering that OCT-4 protein is a transcription factor that regulates expression of ABC transporters, level of gene expression, activity of ABC proteins and cell sensitivity to chemotherapy were evaluated after OCT4-PG1 silencing. Besides we set up a STRING network. Results showed that after OCT4-PG1 silencing, cells expressed OCT-4 gene and protein to a lesser extent than mock cells. The gene and protein expression of ABCB1, as well as its activity were reduced. On the other hand, ALOX5 and ABCC1 genes was increased even as the activity of this transporter. Moreover, the silencing cells become sensitive to two chemotherapics tested. The network structure demonstrated that OCT4-PG1 protein interacts directly with OCT-4, SOX2, and NANOG and indirectly with ABC transporters. We conclude that OCT4-PG1 pseudogene plays a key role in the regulation OCT-4 transcription factor, which alters MDR phenotype in the FEPS cell line.","['Lettnin, Aline Portantiolo', 'Wagner, Eduardo Felipe', 'Carrett-Dias, Michele', 'Dos Santos Machado, Karina', 'Werhli, Adriano', 'Canedo, Andres Delgado', 'Trindade, Gilma Santos', 'de Souza Votto, Ana Paula']","['Lettnin AP', 'Wagner EF', 'Carrett-Dias M', 'Dos Santos Machado K', 'Werhli A', 'Canedo AD', 'Trindade GS', 'de Souza Votto AP']","['Post-Graduate Program in Physiological Sciences - PPGCF, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Cell Culture, Institute of Biological Sciences - ICB, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Cell Culture, Institute of Biological Sciences - ICB, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Physiological Sciences - PPGCF, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil.', 'Center of Computational Sciences - C3, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil.', 'Center of Computational Sciences - C3, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Pampa - UNIPAMPA, Avenue Antonio Trilha, 1847, Sao Gabriel, RS, Zip Code 97300-000, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Physiological Sciences - PPGCF, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil.', 'Post-Graduate Program in Physiological Sciences - PPGCF, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil. anavotto@yahoo.com.br.', 'Laboratory of Cell Culture, Institute of Biological Sciences - ICB, Federal University of Rio Grande -FURG, Avenue Italia, Km 8, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil. anavotto@yahoo.com.br.', 'Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Avenida Italia, Km 8, s/n, Rio Grande, RS, Zip Code 96203-900, Brazil. anavotto@yahoo.com.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190205,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-019-04639-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-019-04639-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2019 Apr;46(2):1873-1884. doi: 10.1007/s11033-019-04639-4.

We evaluated CD4+ Th cell polarization among patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and confirmed that survivors had a higher percentage of circulating Th2 cells but lower frequencies of Th17 cells and neutrophils early in the course of infection. To establish the mechanism of this protection, we used a mouse model of lethal S. aureus bacteremia and found that intratracheal pretreatment with the type 2-initiating cytokine IL-33 activated pulmonary type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and promoted eosinophilia. In addition, stimulation of type 2 immunity before lethal infection suppressed the pulmonary neutrophilic response to S. aureus. Mice lacking functional ILC2s did not respond to IL-33 and were not protected from lethal bacteremia, but treatment of these mice with the type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 rescued them from death.

Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) from bone marrow stromal cells is secreted in exosomes, which are subsequently endocytosed by leukemia cells, and protect leukemia cells from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Expression of FGF2 and its receptor, FGFR1, are both increased in a subset of stromal cell lines and primary AML stroma; and increased FGF2/FGFR1 signaling is associated with increased exosome secretion. FGFR inhibition (or gene silencing) interrupts stromal autocrine growth and significantly decreases secretion of FGF2-containing exosomes, resulting in less stromal protection of leukemia cells. Likewise, Fgf2 -/- mice transplanted with retroviral BCR-ABL leukemia survive significantly longer than their +/+ counterparts when treated with TKI. Thus, inhibition of FGFR can modulate stromal function, reduce exosome secretion, and may be a therapeutic option to overcome resistance to TKIs.

The oxidized products are multifunctional. In this study, we investigated how oxidized fatty acids inhibit cell proliferation in cultured cells. We used polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5), linoleic acid (LA; 18:2), and palmitic acid (16:0). Oxidized fatty acids were produced by autoxidation of fatty acids for 2 days in the presence of a gas mixture (20% O2 and 80% N2). We found that oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (OxDHA, OxEPA and OxLA) inhibited cell proliferation much more effectively compared with unoxidized fatty acids (DHA, EPA and LA, respectively) in THP1 (a human monocytic leukemia cell line) and DLD1 (a human colorectal cancer cell line) cells. In particular, OxDHA markedly inhibited cell proliferation. DHA has the largest number of double bonds and is most susceptible to oxidation among the fatty acids. OxDHA has the largest number of highly active oxidized products. Therefore, the oxidative levels of fatty acids are associated with the antiproliferative activity. Moreover, caspase3/7 was activated in the cells treated with OxDHA, but not in those treated with DHA. A pancaspase inhibitor (zVADfmk) reduced the cell death induced by OxDHA. These results indicated that oxidized products from polyunsaturated fatty acids induced apoptosis in cultured cells. Collectively, the switch between cell survival and cell death may be regulated by the activity and/or number of oxidized products from polyunsaturated fatty acids.","['Iuchi, Katsuya', 'Ema, Mika', 'Suzuki, Moe', 'Yokoyama, Chikako', 'Hisatomi, Hisashi']","['Iuchi K', 'Ema M', 'Suzuki M', 'Yokoyama C', 'Hisatomi H']","['Department of Materials and Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Seikei University, Tokyo 1808633, Japan.', 'Department of Materials and Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Seikei University, Tokyo 1808633, Japan.', 'Department of Materials and Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Seikei University, Tokyo 1808633, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamagata University, Yonezawa, Yamagata 9928510, Japan.', 'Department of Materials and Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Seikei University, Tokyo 1808633, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190205,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,PMC6423586,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/08/02 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/mmr.2019.9940 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2019 Apr;19(4):2767-2773. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2019.9940.

Accumulating evidence has revealed that novel lncRNAs exerted critical roles in these processes. In the present study, we investigated the effects of lncRNA linc00239 (NR_026774.1), which is 662 phinucleotides (nt) in length and was found to be upregulated in AML patients, on malignant behaviours and chemosensitivity in AML cells, including KG1 and HL60. linc00239 expression was detected in KG1 and HL60 cells by quantitative PCR and northern blotting, and it was found that linc00239 is detectable by both of these assays. After knockdown or overexpression of linc00239 in AML cells, the results revealed that the presence of linc00239 promoted proliferation, colony formation and migration ability. Furthermore, the presence of linc00239 increased chemoresistance to doxorubicin in AML cells partially by preventing doxorubicininduced apoptotic cell death. It was also determined that the presence of linc00239 was related to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR using 1 microM NVPBEZ235 (BEZ) abolished the inhibitory effect of linc00239 on chemosensitivity and the preventative effect on doxorubicininduced cell death. Collectively, our data revealed that linc00239 is a novel tumour promoter in AML cells and indicated that it is a potential therapeutic target.","['Yang, Yuting', 'Dai, Wenshu', 'Sun, Yingwei', 'Zhao, Ziyi']","['Yang Y', 'Dai W', 'Sun Y', 'Zhao Z']","['Department of Scientific Research, The Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072, P.R.

However, the biological function of miR148a in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. In the present study, the expression levels of miR148a and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) were detected using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting. Methylationspecific PCR was used to detect the methylation levels in the miR148a promoter. The effects of miR148a on cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by Cell Counting kit8 or flow cytometry assays, respectively. A dualluciferase reporter assay was performed to investigate the association between miR148a and DNMT1. Patients with AML exhibited an increased expression level of miR148a, whereas the expression level of DNMT1 was identified to be decreased compared with healthy control subjects. In AML cell lines, the methylation state of miR148 promoter was significantly increased compared with normal cells. Following knockdown of DNMT1 in U937 cells, the expression level of miR148a increased significantly, whereas the methylation level of the miR148a promoter decreased. The mRNA and protein expression levels of DNMT1 decreased following transfection with miR148a mimics in U937 cells. Conversely, transfection with miR148a inhibitor in Kasumi1 cells led to an increase in the expression level of DNMT. Dualluciferase reporter assays suggested that DNMT1 was one of the direct target genes of miR148a. Overexpression of miR148a inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Inhibition of DNMT1 led to a decreased methylation level of the 5'cytosinephosphateguanine3' islands in the miR148a promoter, thus increasing the expression level of miR148a. DNMT1 was identified to be a downstream target of miR148a, and was negatively regulated by miR148a in AML cell lines, suggesting that miR148a and DNMT1 form a mutual negative feedback loop.","['Wang, Xiao-Xue', 'Zhang, Heyang', 'Li, Yan']","['Wang XX', 'Zhang H', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, P.R.

Previous studies reported that increased expression of PDIA3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a marker for poor prognosis. However, the mechanism remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to understand the role of PDIA3 in HCC development. First, immunohistochemical staining of tissues from 53 HCC cases revealed that HCC tissues with high PDIA3 expression exhibited a higher proliferation index and contained fewer apoptotic cells than those with low expression. In addition, the knockdown of PDIA3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. These results suggest that PDIA3 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis in HCC. An examination of whether PDIA3 knockdown induced apoptosis through ER stress revealed that PDIA3 knockdown did not increase ER stress marker, 78 kDa glucoseregulated protein, in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, the association between PDIA3 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed colocalization and binding, respectively, of PDIA3 and STAT3 in HCC cell lines. The knockdown of PDIA3 decreased the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 (PSTAT3; Tyr705) and downstream proteins of the STAT3 signaling pathway: The antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl2like protein 1, induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl1, survivin and Xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis protein). In addition, PDIA3 knockdown provided little inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in HCC cell lines treated with AG490, a tyrosineprotein kinase JAK/STAT3 signaling inhibitor. Finally, an association was demonstrated between PDIA3 and PSTAT3 expression following immunostaining of 35 HCC samples. Together, the present data suggest that PDIA3 promotes HCC progression through the STAT3 signaling pathway.","['Kondo, Ryota', 'Ishino, Kousuke', 'Wada, Ryuichi', 'Takata, Hideyuki', 'Peng, Wei-Xia', 'Kudo, Mitsuhiro', 'Kure, Shoko', 'Kaneya, Yohei', 'Taniai, Nobuhiko', 'Yoshida, Hiroshi', 'Naito, Zenya']","['Kondo R', 'Ishino K', 'Wada R', 'Takata H', 'Peng WX', 'Kudo M', 'Kure S', 'Kaneya Y', 'Taniai N', 'Yoshida H', 'Naito Z']","['Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal and HepatoBiliaryPancreatic Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal and HepatoBiliaryPancreatic Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal and HepatoBiliaryPancreatic Surgery, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.', 'Department of Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 1138602, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190204,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2019.4710 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2019 Apr;54(4):1409-1421. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2019.4710.

Isoforms of a protein can perform the same, similar, or even opposite biological functions. A previous study identified principal isoforms of proteins based on the extent of interactions per isoform in a functional relationship network, focusing on data from normal tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of specific isoforms of various genes associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis are frequently altered in tumors compared with those in normal tissues. In this study, we aimed to identify higher degree isoforms (HDIs) of multi-isoform genes (MIGs) in cancer by applying a meta-analytical framework to calculate co-expression between each pair of isoforms in two large datasets of RNA-seq profiles from breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and colon cancer cell lines. Then, we compared HDIs with isoforms identified by proteomic data and prognostic and predictive evidence in various cancers. In addition, we separately analyzed the associations between HDIs and non-HDIs (nHDIs) of the same genes according to transcript expression and drug responses in various cancer type cell lines. Collectively, these results indicated the complex properties of HDIs per gene identified by cancer type-based isoform-isoform co-expression networks and showed the potential of HDIs as novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.","['Ma, Jun', 'Wang, Jenny', 'Ghoraie, Laleh Soltan', 'Men, Xin', 'Haibe-Kains, Benjamin', 'Dai, Penggao']","['Ma J', 'Wang J', 'Ghoraie LS', 'Men X', 'Haibe-Kains B', 'Dai P']","[""National Engineering Research Center for Miniaturized Detection Systems, Northwest University, Xi'an, P.

Furthermore, it is currently difficult to accurately identify subset-specific SSC marker distributions due to the poor nuclear morphological characteristics associated with fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. In the present study, testicular cross-sections and whole-mount samples were Bouin fixed to optimize nuclear resolution and visualized by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). The results identified an expression pattern of PLZF(high)c-KIT(pos) in A1 spermatogonia, while A2-A4-differentiating spermatogonia were PLZF(low)c-KIT(pos). Additionally, this procedure was used to examine asymmetrically expressing GFRA1 and PLZF clones, asymmetric Apr and false clones were distinguished based on the presence or absence of TEX14, a molecular maker of intercellular bridges, despite having identical nuclear morphology and intercellular distances that were <25 mum. In conclusion, this optimized Bouin fixation procedure facilitates the accurate identification of spermatogonium subsets based on their molecular profiles and is capable of distinguishing asymmetric and false clones. Therefore, the findings presented herein will facilitate further morphological and functional analysis studies and provide further insight into spermatogonium subtypes.","['Tang, Rui-Ling', 'Fan, Li-Qing']","['Tang RL', 'Fan LQ']","['Institute of Reproduction and Stem Cell Engineering, School of Basic Medicine Science, Central South University, Changsha 410078, China.', 'Institute of Reproduction and Stem Cell Engineering, School of Basic Medicine Science, Central South University, Changsha 410078, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Asian J Androl,Asian journal of andrology,100942132,PMC6498726,,2019/02/06 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['250999 [pii]', '10.4103/aja.aja_103_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Asian J Androl. 2019 May-Jun;21(3):309-318. doi: 10.4103/aja.aja_103_18.,['NOTNLM'],"['*asymmetric division', '*cellular homolog of feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit', '*false clones', '*glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 1', '*promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger', '*spermatogonia stem cell']",,,,,,20200526,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Seminiferous Tubules/cytology', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatogonia/*metabolism', 'Testis/cytology', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']","['0 (Gfra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (TEX14 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the association between reproductive factors and the risk of lymphoid neoplasm and its subgroups. We used data from a large-scale, population-based prospective study in a Japanese cohort with 42 691 eligible women aged 40-69 years from 1990 to 1994. During a mean follow up of 18.7 years, we identified 176 cases of lymphoid neoplasm and 90 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the risk of lymphoid neoplasms and its subgroups according to self-reported reproductive factors. Parous women had an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasm compared with nulliparous women (HR = 2.51, 95% CI, 1.03-6.13). An increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms was found in women with later onset of menarche (</=13 years old; reference: 14-15; HR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.10-2.79: >/=16; HR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.17-3.19: P-trend: 0.01) and a shorter menstrual cycle (28-29 days; reference: </=27; HR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.05-2.43, P-trend = 0.81). No association was observed between lymphoid neoplasms and other reproductive factors, including age at first birth, breastfeeding, type of menopause, or exogenous hormone use. Our study suggests that ever parity, late age at menarche and a short menstrual cycle length may be associated with the development of lymphoid neoplasms. The inconsistency seen in epidemiological research to date warrants further investigation.","['Tanaka, Shiori', 'Sawada, Norie', 'Yamaji, Taiki', 'Shimazu, Taichi', 'Goto, Atsushi', 'Iwasaki, Motoki', 'Inoue, Manami', 'Tsugane, Shoichiro']","['Tanaka S', 'Sawada N', 'Yamaji T', 'Shimazu T', 'Goto A', 'Iwasaki M', 'Inoue M', 'Tsugane S']","['Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Global Health Policy, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190309,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC6447856,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13962 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Apr;110(4):1442-1452. doi: 10.1111/cas.13962.

The Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family has been reported to participate in diverse human diseases. However, little is known about their expression and prognostic values in human leukemia. Herein, we conducted a detailed cancer versus normal analysis. The mRNA expression levels of the RUNX family in various kinds of cancers, including leukemia, were analyzed via the ONCOMINE and GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) databases. We observed that the mRNA expression levels of RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3 were all increased in most cancers compared with normal tissues, especially in leukemia. Moreover, the expression levels of RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3 are also highly expressed in almost all cancer cell lines, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, analyzed by Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) databases. Further, the LinkedOmics and GEPIA databases were used to evaluate the prognostic values. In survival analyses based on LinkedOmics, higher expression of RUNX1 and RUNX2 indicated a better overall survival (OS), but with no significance, whereas increased RUNX3 revealed a poor OS in leukemia. In addition, the GEPIA dataset was also used to perform survival analyses, and results manifested that the expression of RUNX1 and RUNX2 had no remarkable correction with OS in leukemia, but it showed highly expressed RUNX3 was significantly related with poor OS in leukemia. In conclusion, the RUNX family showed significant expression differences between cancer and normal tissues, especially leukemia, and RUNX3 could be a promising prognostic biomarker for leukemia.","['Sun, Cheng-Cao', 'Li, Shu-Jun', 'Chen, Zhen-Long', 'Li, Guang', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Li, De-Jia']","['Sun CC', 'Li SJ', 'Chen ZL', 'Li G', 'Zhang Q', 'Li DJ']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, P.R.

Four out of five of our patients are dead from lymphoma or bone marrow failure, with severe infection and massive bleeding; the fifth patient is asymptomatic despite a persistent CD4+ lymphopenia. Most patients reported in the literature are microcephalic females with growth failure, sinopulmonary infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, very low B-cells, and radiosensitivity; while bone marrow failure and malignancy may develop at a later age. Dysmorphic facial features, congenital hip dysplasia, chronic liver disease, gradual pancytopenia, lymphoma or leukemia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported as well. Most mutations are compound heterozygous, and all of them are hypomorphic, with two common truncating mutations accounting for the majority of patients. Stem-cell transplantation after reduced intensity conditioning regimes may be curative.","['Staines Boone, Aide Tamara', 'Chinn, Ivan K', 'Alaez-Verson, Carmen', 'Yamazaki-Nakashimada, Marco A', 'Carrillo-Sanchez, Karol', 'Garcia-Cruz, Maria de la Luz Hortensia', 'Poli, M Cecilia', 'Gonzalez Serrano, M Edith', 'Medina Torres, Edgar A', 'Muzquiz Zermeno, David', 'Forbes, Lisa R', 'Espinosa-Rosales, Francisco J', 'Espinosa-Padilla, Sara E', 'Orange, Jordan S', 'Lugo Reyes, Saul Oswaldo']","['Staines Boone AT', 'Chinn IK', 'Alaez-Verson C', 'Yamazaki-Nakashimada MA', 'Carrillo-Sanchez K', 'Garcia-Cruz MLH', 'Poli MC', 'Gonzalez Serrano ME', 'Medina Torres EA', 'Muzquiz Zermeno D', 'Forbes LR', 'Espinosa-Rosales FJ', 'Espinosa-Padilla SE', 'Orange JS', 'Lugo Reyes SO']","['Immunology Department at Hospital de Especialidades, UMAE 25 IMSS, Monterrey, Mexico.', ""Center for Human Immunobiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Genomic Diagnostic Laboratory at the National Institute for Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Clinical Immunology Department, National Institute of Pediatrics, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Genomic Diagnostic Laboratory at the National Institute for Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Otolaryngology Department at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), Mexico City, Mexico.', ""Center for Human Immunobiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."", 'Universidad del Desarrollo, Clinica Alemana de Santiago, Santiago de Chile, Chile.', 'Immunodeficiencies Research Unit at the National Institute of Pediatrics (INP), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Immunodeficiencies Research Unit at the National Institute of Pediatrics (INP), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Immunology Department at Hospital de Especialidades, UMAE 25 IMSS, Monterrey, Mexico.', ""Center for Human Immunobiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.', 'Immunodeficiencies Research Unit at the National Institute of Pediatrics (INP), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Mexican Foundation for Girls and Boys with Primary Immunodeficiencies (FUMENI, AC), Huixquilucan, Mexico.', 'Immunodeficiencies Research Unit at the National Institute of Pediatrics (INP), Mexico City, Mexico.', ""Center for Human Immunobiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.', 'Immunodeficiencies Research Unit at the National Institute of Pediatrics (INP), Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190121,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC6348249,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/02/06 06:01,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2018.00426 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Jan 21;6:426. doi: 10.3389/fped.2018.00426. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair defects', 'case series', 'clinical spectrum', 'inborn error of immunity', 'ligase IV deficiency', 'primary immunodeficiency']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While epigenetic modifications are essential for normal cell differentiation, several driver mutations in leukemic pathogenesis have been identified in genes that affect epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Several therapeutic options to target epigenetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been successfully tested in preclinical studies and various drugs have already been approved for use in clinical practice. Among these already approved therapeutics are hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine) and isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors (ivosidenib, enasidenib). Other agents such as bromodomain-containing epigenetic reader proteins and histone methylation (e.g. DOT1L) inhibitors are currently in advanced clinical testing. As several epigenetic therapies have only limited efficacy when used as single agents, combination therapies that target AML pathogenesis at different levels and exploit synergistic mechanisms are also in clinical trials. Combinations of either epigenetic therapies with conventional chemotherapy, different forms of epigenetic therapies, or epigenetic therapies with immunotherapy are showing promising early results. In this review we summarize the underlying pathophysiology and rationale for epigenetically-based combination therapies, review current preclinical and clinical data and discuss the future directions of epigenetic therapy combinations in AML.","['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Shallis, Rory', 'Stahl, Maximilian', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Shallis R', 'Stahl M', 'Zeidan AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, PO Box 208028, New Haven, CT 06520-8055, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190111,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC6348528,"['Conflict of interest statement: A.M.Z. had a consultancy with and received', 'honoraria from AbbVie, Otsuka, Pfizer, Celgene, Ariad, Agios, Novartis,', 'Acceleron, Astellas, Daiichi Sankyo and Takeda; and received honoraria from and', 'was a speaker for Takeda.

Overexpressions of SUV39H2 at gene, mRNA and protein levels are known to be associated with a range of cancers: leukemia, lymphomas, lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer and so on. Accumulating evidence indicates that SUV39H2 acts as an oncogene and contributes to the initiation and progression of cancers. It could, therefore, be a promising target for anti-cancer treatment.

However, the prognostic and clinicopathological value of miR-155 remains unclear. Here, we performed this systemic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of miR-155 expression in hematologic malignancies. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library databases and OVID to identify eligible studies published from Jan 1, 2008 to Aug 1, 2018. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to detect the prognostic and clinicopathological role of miR-155 in hematologic malignancies. Results: A total of 18 studies including 2316 patients were enrolled in the present meta-analysis, indicating significant association between elevated miR-155 expression and poor overall survival (OS) in 2114 patients (pooled HR = 1.72, 95%CI [1.50-1.97], p<0.001). Elevated miR-155 expression level was related to shorter event free survival (EFS, pooled HR = 1.55, 95%CI [0.94-2.57], P=0.002), disease free survival (DFS, pooled HR = 1.38, 95%CI [1.13-1.68], P=0.001), progress free survival (PFS, pooled HR = 1.58, 95%CI [1.06-2.35], p<0.001) and treatment free survival (TFS, pooled HR = 1.67, 95%CI [1.16-2.39], P=0.006). Additionally, overexpression of miR-155 was found to be significantly related to FLT3/ITD presence (OR=4.751, 95%CI [3.229-6.990], P<0.001), more WT1 mutation (OR=2.090, 95%CI [1.240-3.522], P=0.006) and less CEBPA mutation (OR=0.477, 95%CI [0.286-0.794], P=0.004) in 552 AML patients. Conclusion: MiR-155 expression was found to be associated with several leukemia-related phenotype and poor prognosis in hematologic malignancies. Therefore, miR-155 overexpression might be a convinced unfavorable prognostic indicator that helps the clinical decision-making process.","['Tang, Lu', 'Peng, Yi-Zhong', 'Li, Cheng-Gong', 'Jiang, Hui-Wen', 'Mei, Heng', 'Hu, Yu']","['Tang L', 'Peng YZ', 'Li CG', 'Jiang HW', 'Mei H', 'Hu Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease.', 'Institute of Orthopedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Hubei clinical medical center of cell therapy for neoplastic disease.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190101,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,PMC6360418,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2019/02/06 06:00,2019/02/06 06:01,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.28537 [doi]', 'jcav10p0654 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2019 Jan 1;10(3):654-664. doi: 10.7150/jca.28537. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarker', 'Hematologic malignancies', 'Meta-analysis', 'MiR-155', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective analysis aimed to describe the outcomes and risk factors in such children. Data were collected through the nation-wide registry program in Japan. A total of 417 AML (median age: 13 years) patients 20 years or younger at HSCT, between January 2001 and December 2015, were included. A total of 314 patients died, and the median follow-up duration of the survivors was 1052 days. The most frequent cause of death was leukemia progression (58%). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19-28%). Chronic GVHD was associated with improved 3-year OS (47%, 95% CI, 36-57%, hazard ratio: 0.603, p = 0.001).

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) may provide cure in this scenario. We compared outcomes of HSCT from HLA-identical (HLA-id, n = 1654) sibling or haploidentical (Haplo, n = 389) donors in patients with R/R-AML, performed during the period 2007-2015. The Haplo group included patients receiving an unmanipulated graft (post-transplant cyclophosphamide, n = 278; in vivo T-cell depletion, n = 95; or both, n = 16). Median age at HSCT was 52 (range 18-74) years. Median follow-up was 16 and 22 months for HLA-id sibling and Haplo recipients, respectively (p = 0.11). Compared to MSD, Haplo HSCT were performed more recently (2013 vs 2011, p < 0.01), at longer interval from diagnosis (7 vs 5 months, p < 0.01), more frequently using bone marrow as stem cell source (47% vs 8%, p < 0.01) and with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (50% vs 43%, p = 0.03). Engraftment was higher (93% vs 83%, p < 0.01) in HLA-id sibling. In multivariate analysis, Haplo HSCT was associated with lower GVHD/relapse-free survival, inferior LFS and OS and higher NRM, mainly due to a higher rate of infections (41% vs 25%, p < 0.01). For R/R-AML, HLA-id sibling donors remain the gold standard, when available, due to higher mortality in Haplo without significant gain in disease control.","['Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Boumendil, Ariane', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Eder, Matthias', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Battipaglia G', 'Boumendil A', 'Labopin M', 'Ciceri F', 'Tischer J', 'Stelljes M', 'Ehninger G', 'Beelen D', 'Finke J', 'Van Lint MT', 'Eder M', 'Afanasyev B', 'Fanin R', 'Mohty M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Nagler A']","[""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France. giorgia.battipaglia@aphp.fr."", 'Hematology Department, Federico II University, Naples, Italy. giorgia.battipaglia@aphp.fr.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', ""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris University UPMC, INSERM U938, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; University Vita-Salute San, Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Munich-Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine / Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Universitaetsklinikum Dresden, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'University of Freiburg, Dept. of Medicine -Hematology, Oncology, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Ospedale San Martino, Department of Haematology II Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Haematology, Hemostasis, Oncologyand Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'First State Pavlov Medical University of St. Petersburg, Lev Tolstoy St Petersburg, Russia.', 'Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria di Udine, Division of Hematology, Udine, Italy.', ""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris University UPMC, INSERM U938, Paris, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Roma, Italy."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190204,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,2019/02/06 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-019-0459-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-019-0459-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Sep;54(9):1499-1510. doi: 10.1038/s41409-019-0459-7.

Circulating cytokine levels are elevated in MF patients; a subset of which have been shown to be poor prognostic indicators. In this study, cytokine overproduction was examined in MF patient plasma and in MF blood cells ex vivo using mass cytometry. Plasma cytokines measured following treatment with ruxolitinib remained markedly abnormal, indicating that aberrant cytokine production persists despite therapeutic JAK2 inhibition. In MF patient samples, 14/15 cytokines measured by mass cytometry were found to be constitutively overproduced, with the principal cellular source for most cytokines being monocytes, implicating a non-cell-autonomous role for monocyte-derived cytokines impacting disease-propagating stem/progenitor cells in MF. The majority of cytokines elevated in MF exhibited ex vivo hypersensitivity to thrombopoietin (TPO), toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). A subset of this group (including TNF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) was minimally sensitive to ruxolitinib. All TPO/TLR/TNF-sensitive cytokines, however, were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of NFkappaB and/or MAP kinase signaling. These results indicate that NFkappaB and MAP kinase signaling maintain cytokine overproduction in MF, and that inhibition of these pathways may provide optimal control of inflammatory pathophysiology in MF.","['Fisher, Daniel A C', 'Miner, Cathrine A', 'Engle, Elizabeth K', 'Hu, Hengrui', 'Collins, Taylor B', 'Zhou, Amy', 'Allen, Maggie J', 'Malkova, Olga N', 'Oh, Stephen T']","['Fisher DAC', 'Miner CA', 'Engle EK', 'Hu H', 'Collins TB', 'Zhou A', 'Allen MJ', 'Malkova ON', 'Oh ST']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Immunomonitoring Laboratory, Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Program in Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Immunomonitoring Laboratory, Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA. stoh@wustl.edu.', 'Immunomonitoring Laboratory, Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA. stoh@wustl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190204,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6813809,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0379-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0379-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):1978-1995. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0379-y.

MCL1 is an antiapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family that has been found to play an essential role in advancing chemoresistance and could be a promising target for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Here, we found that deubiquitinating enzyme 3 (DUB3) interacts with and deubiquitinates MCL1 in the cytoplasm of ovarian cancer cells, which protects MCL1 from degradation. Furthermore, we identified that O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a key activator of DUB3 transcription, and that the MGMT inhibitor PaTrin-2 effectively suppresses ovarian cancer cells with elevated MGMT-DUB3-MCL1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Most interestingly, we found that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) could significantly activate MGMT/DUB3 expression; the combined administration of HDACis and PaTrin-2 led to the ideal therapeutic effect.

METHODS: Using data from the 13 National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries we identified women diagnosed with a primary endometrial cancer between 1992 and 2014. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for second primary cancer risk (all anatomical sites combined and for individual anatomical sites) among patients with endometrial cancer compared with the general population, in the overall study population and according to histological subtype. RESULTS: Among 96 256 women diagnosed with endometrial cancer, 8.4% (n=8083) developed a second primary cancer. The risk of second primary cancer was higher among patients with endometrial cancer than in the general population (SIR=1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.07). We observed significantly higher second primary cancer risk among women with high grade endometrioid (SIR=1.12, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.19), serous (SIR=1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.38), carcinosarcoma (SIR=1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.35), mixed epithelial (SIR=1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40), and sarcoma (SIR=1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.45) compared with the general population, but not for women with low grade endometrioid (SIR=1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.03) or clear cell (SIR=1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33) endometrial cancer. Women with low grade endometrioid endometrial cancer had significantly lower second primary cancer risks in the gum and other mouth (SIR=0.57, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97), lung and bronchus (SIR=0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77), and lymphocytic leukemia (SIR=0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93) while women with high risk endometrial cancer histological subtypes experienced significantly higher second primary cancer risk at several anatomical sites. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of developing second primary cancersat all anatomic sites combined and at individual anatomical sites varied according to histological subtype.

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in PCa chemoresistance could improve treatment of patients with PCa. In the present study, using immune histochemical, chemistry, and precipitation assays with cells from individuals with benign or malignant prostate cancer or established PCa cell lines, we found that the oncogenic transcription factor pre-B cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) promotes PCa cell proliferation and confers to resistance against common anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin. We observed that genetic PBX1 knockdown abrogates this resistance, and further experiments revealed that PBX1 stability was modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. To directly probe the impact of this pathway on PBX1 activity, we screened for PBX1-specific deubiquitinases (Dubs) and found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9x) interacted with and stabilized the PBX1 protein by attenuating its Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination. Moreover, the USP9x inhibitor WP1130 markedly induced PBX1 degradation and promoted PCa cell apoptosis. The results in this study indicate that PBX1 confers to PCa chemoresistance and identify USP9x as a Dub of PBX1. We concluded that targeting the USP9x/PBX1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for managing advanced prostate cancer.","['Liu, Yan', 'Xu, Xiaofeng', 'Lin, Peng', 'He, Yuanming', 'Zhang, Yawen', 'Cao, Biyin', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Liu, Jinbao', 'Zhou, Xiumin', 'Mao, Xinliang']","['Liu Y', 'Xu X', 'Lin P', 'He Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Cao B', 'Zhang Z', 'Sethi G', 'Liu J', 'Zhou X', 'Mao X']","['From the Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan 610071, China.', 'the Department of Urology, Nanjing Jinling Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 21002, China.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'From the Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 117600 Singapore.', 'From the Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.', 'the Department of Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, China, and alice-xm@163.com.', 'From the Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China, xinliangmao@gzhmu.edu.cn.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190204,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC6433065,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2018/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)39027-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA118.006057 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Mar 22;294(12):4572-4582. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.006057.

METHODS: Study participants include 14 adolescents who visited a hospital for follow-up care following treatment for leukemia at a university hospital in Seoul. We investigated difficulties in returning to school using in-depth interviews. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, the researchers investigated ""difficulties after termination of leukemia treatment,"" ""difficulties in school life,"" ""difficulties in relationships with family,"" and ""causes of stress."" RESULTS: Through interviews, we identified five categories of difficulties among adolescent leukemia survivors including ""feelings of alienation from friends,"" ""difficulty in studying,"" ""Stuck being different from others"", ""apologetic feelings for family,"" and ""feelings of having an uncertain future."" CONCLUSION: Most adolescent leukemia survivors in the study sample complained about difficulties in friendships and academic difficulties. Changes in appearance following treatment and the focus of others on their appearance following treatment hurt their feelings, and they felt apologetic toward members of their families. Worries about incomplete recovery following treatment and the fear of recurrence tended to interfere with the feelings of adolescent leukemia survivors about their future.","['An, Hyeran', 'Lee, Sunhee']","['An H', 'Lee S']","['Department of Nursing Science, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, South Korea.', 'College of Nursing, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.

METHOD: A multi-center retrospective cohort study including 205 children who died from incurable cancer between June 2008 and September 2013 were analyzed. RESULTS: An incurable diagnosis was confirmed between 0 and 1726 (median, 279) days from initial diagnosis with death occurring between 1 and 239(median, 83) days. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (93.7%), pain (87.3%), and poor appetite (76.1%). The earliest symptoms were pain and fatigue. Children with leukemia and lymphoma also complained early of nausea/vomiting, and children with solid tumors complained early of disturbed sleep. Later in the palliative phase, altered consciousness and seizures were found in children with central nervous system tumors and solid tumors, while children with leukemia and lymphoma were found to have fever, diarrhea, and bleeding. However, these symptoms only persisted for a short time. DNR discussions were held in 89 cases (43.4%) at a median of 37 (range, 4-178) days before death.

A panoply of biological processes is involved as the cause of these diseases. In order to unveil the mechanistic details of these diseased states, we analyzed protein families relevant to these diseases. RESULTS: Our present study pivots around four apparently unrelated cancer types among which two are commonly occurring viz. Prostate Cancer, Breast Cancer and two relatively less frequent viz. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Lymphoma. Eight protein families were found to have implications for these cancer types. Our results strikingly reveal that some of the proteins with implications in the cancerous cellular states were showing the structural organization disparate from the signature of the family it constitutes. The sequences were further mapped onto respective structures and compared with the entropic profile. The structures reveal that entropic scores were able to reveal the inherent structural bias of these proteins with quantitative precision, otherwise unseen from other analysis. Subsequently, the betweenness centrality scoring of each residue from the structure network models was resorted to explore the changes in dependencies on residue owing to structural disorder. CONCLUSION: These observations help to obtain the mechanistic changes resulting from the structural orchestration of protein structures. Finally, the hydropathy indexes were obtained to validate the sequence space observations using Shannon entropy and in-turn establishing the compatibility.","['Sen, Sagnik', 'Dey, Ashmita', 'Chowdhury, Sourav', 'Maulik, Ujjwal', 'Chattopadhyay, Krishnananda']","['Sen S', 'Dey A', 'Chowdhury S', 'Maulik U', 'Chattopadhyay K']","['Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India. sagnik.sen2008@gmail.com.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India.', 'CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Raja S.C.

Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens could have different clinical outcomes. This purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcome of MAC versus RIC regimens in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively compared long-term outcomes with MAC and RIC regimens in patients with AML who underwent allo-HSCT at our tertiary transplantation center. Results: We analyzed survival outcomes after MAC-HSCT versus RICHSCT among 107 adult patients with AML diagnosed from 2001 through 2017. Of those, 44 patients underwent a MAC regimen, whereas 63 patients received a RIC regimen. The median follow-up time was 37 months (range: 6-210) for the entire group. The 3-year overall survival (OS) for RIC and MAC patients was 67% and 60%, respectively (p>0.05). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) for RIC and MAC patients was 88% and 77%. In multivariate analysis, the type of conditioning regimen (RIC vs. MAC) did not influence PFS (p=0.24). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was seen in five of the RIC patients and 9 of the MAC patients. Chronic GVHD was seen in 16 of the RIC patients and 6 of the MAC patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of acute GVHD (p=0.089), but there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of chronic GVHD (p=0.03). Conclusion: This retrospective analysis confirmed that MAC and RIC regimens had a consistently equivalent rate of OS and PFS in AML patients who underwent allo-HSCT. The choice of MAC versus RIC conditioning regimen might be decided on the basis of patient and disease characteristics.","['Ciftciler, Rafiye', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Aladag, Elifcan', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Ozcebe, Osman', 'Tekin, Fatma', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Ciftciler R', 'Goker H', 'Demiroglu H', 'Aladag E', 'Aksu S', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Sayinalp N', 'Ozcebe O', 'Tekin F', 'Buyukasik Y']","['Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190205,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,PMC6516104,,2019/02/06 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2019/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2018.0220 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2019 May 3;36(2):88-96. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2018.0220.

Salvianolic acid A (Sal A) is a major effective component in treating ATO-induced cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the objective of our study was to assess whether Sal A had protective effects by the regulation of calcium homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. For the in vivo study, BALB/c mice were treated with ATO and/or Sal A via daily tail vein injections for two weeks. For the in vitro study, we detected the effects of ATO and/or Sal A in real time using adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) and an IonOptix MyoCam system. Our results showed that Sal A pretreatment alleviated cardiac dysfunction and Ca(2+) overload induced by ATO in vivo and vitro. Moreover, Sal A increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity and expression, alleviated [Ca(2+)]ER depletion, and decreased ER stress-related protein expression. Sal A protects the heart from ATO-induced injury and its administration correlates with the modulation of SERCA, the recovery of Ca(2+) homeostasis, and the down-regulation of ER stress-mediated apoptosis.","['Wang, Ruiying', 'Zhang, Jingyi', 'Wang, Shan', 'Wang, Min', 'Ye, Tianyuan', 'Du, Yuyang', 'Xie, Xueheng', 'Ye, Jingxue', 'Sun, Guibo', 'Sun, Xiaobo']","['Wang R', 'Zhang J', 'Wang S',

We substituted amino-acid residues 216 and 218 on RRV-E2-envelope glycoprotein with basic amino-acid residues, because these mutations confer affinity for HS upon RRV. However, T216R-RRV- and N218R-RRV-pseudotyped viruses possessed lower transduction titers, and we demonstrated that HS-affinity impeded release of pseudotyped virus from producer cells. Addition of heparinase to HS-expressing target cells reduces the transduction efficiency of the T216R-RRV- and N218R-RRV-pseudotyped viruses, whereas no such effect is seen in cells lacking HS. Under appropriate conditions, these T216R-RRV- and N218R-RRV-pseudotyped viruses have enhanced capacities for transducing HS-expressing cells. General principles concerning viral adaptation to the use of attachment factors and design of pseudotyped viral vectors are discussed.","['Kesari, Aditi S', 'Sharkey, C Matthew', 'Sanders, David Avram']","['Kesari AS', 'Sharkey CM', 'Sanders DA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.

As kind of extracellular vesicles, exosomes consist of proteins and RNAs and regulate communication among cells. MAIN METHODS: The BMSCs, HS5 cells, and AML cells were co-cultivated with transwell membranes, and treated with different doses of AML chemotherapy drug, etoposide. KEY FINDINGS: Findings of our research proved that co-cultivation of BMSCs with AML cells defended AML against cell death triggered via etoposide, without having an impact on cell growth. An increase in the expression of the 70kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) as well as lysosomal associated membrane protein 3 (CD63) was observed in the exosomes from BMSC and AML, co-cultivated in conditioned media. Exosome repression in BMSC and AML co-cultivating system rebuilt the sensitivity of the KG1A cells to apoptosis triggered via etoposide, indicating that exosome modulated drug resistance in AML. Our study proved that exosomes arising from KG1A cells could propel BMSCs to generate IL-8, which could regulate the effect of etoposide treatment. Furthermore, IL-8 inhibition by its antibody increased the sensitivity of AML cells to cell death triggered via etoposide. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggested that exosomes secreted by AML cells is an essential communicator for the interaction of BMSCs and AML, which can protect AML cells from chemotherapy drug induced apoptosis.","['Chen, Tongtong', 'Zhang, Guozhen', 'Kong, Lingzhen', 'Xu, Shujuan', 'Wang, Yue', 'Dong, Min']","['Chen T', 'Zhang G', 'Kong L', 'Xu S', 'Wang Y', 'Dong M']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Gulin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Gulin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Gulin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Gulin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Gulin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Gulin Medical University, Guilin, China.

METHODS: A prospective FCM DNA ploidy analysis using FxCycle Violet (assay sensitivity 0.01%) was done in 125 consecutive new cases of BCP-ALL (90 cases <15 years of age) and compared with corresponding cytogenetic ploidy (karyotyping and/or FISH) data wherever available. This assay was also subsequently evaluated for detection of residual aneuploid clone in few BCP-ALL cases. RESULTS: Of the total 125 BCP-ALL cases evaluated, flow ploidy analysis revealed diploidy (DI 0.96-1.05) in 44.8% (n = 56), low-hyperdiploidy (DI 1.06 to 1.15) in 13.6% (n = 17), high-hyperdiploidy (DI 1.16-1.39) in 32.8% (n = 41) and near-tetraploidy (DI >/= 1.80) in 2.4% (n = 3) cases. The high risk sub-group of low-hypodiploidy (DI 0.70 to 0.88)/near-triploidy (DI 1.40 to 1.79) constituted 5.6% (n = 7) cases while there was only one case with haploidy (DI 0.58). Overall, high concordance of 90.4% (n = 113) was noted between the combined cytogenetics ploidy and FCM ploidy. Of the total discordant cases (n = 12), the maximum discordance was seen in the low-hyperdiploid DI subgroup (n = 10), which included seven cases with low DNA index high hyperdiploidy (LDI-HHD). FCM DNA ploidy assay was able to detect the residual clone in all six MRD positive aneuploid cases evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: FxCycle based DNA ploidy ascertains strong correlation with cytogenetic profiles and yields complementary information that can be used by the cytogenetics laboratories or otherwise.

This study aimed to identify the predisposing factors of DASA-PAH to stratify high-risk patients for dasatinib-induced PAH (DASA-PAH). METHODS: Sixty consecutive adult patients who received dasatinib were enrolled in this case-control study. We defined DASA-PAH when at least one of the following four criteria was met: (1) recent electrocardiographic changes indicating right ventricular pressure overload, (2) estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure > 40 mmHg measured by Doppler echocardiography; (3) computed tomography (CT)-measured pulmonary artery to aorta diameter (PaD/AoD) ratio > 1; and (4) mean pulmonary arterial pressure > 25 mmHg and pulmonary artery wedge pressure < 15 mmHg measured by right heart catheterization. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients with DASA-PAH among 59 patients analyzed. Baseline PaD/AoD ratios of patients who developed DASA-PAH (PH group) were significantly larger than those who did not (NPH group). A dramatic rise in PaD/AoD ratio after dasatinib treatment was observed. Interestingly, the EUTOS score and spleen size were significantly smaller in the PH than in the NPH group. CONCLUSION: High baseline PaD/AoD ratio and low EUTOS score were associated with DASA-PAH development. The spleen might play a protective role against DASA-PAH.","['Toya, Takumi', 'Nagatomo, Yuji', 'Kagami, Kazuki', 'Yukino, Midori', 'Yasuda, Risako', 'Namba, Takayuki', 'Ido, Yasuo', 'Kobayashi, Shinichi', 'Masaki, Nobuyuki', 'Yada, Hirotaka', 'Kimura, Fumihiko', 'Adachi, Takeshi']","['Toya T', 'Nagatomo Y', 'Kagami K', 'Yukino M', 'Yasuda R', 'Namba T', 'Ido Y', 'Kobayashi S', 'Masaki N', 'Yada H', 'Kimura F', 'Adachi T']","['Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan. tyt0725@gmail.com.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, 359-8513, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190204,United States,Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,100969716,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10554-019-01548-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10554-019-01548-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Cardiovasc Imaging. 2019 Aug;35(8):1435-1442. doi: 10.1007/s10554-019-01548-2.

We review relevant data that have led to recent approval of new targeted therapies in AML and discuss the most promising drugs currently in development in this disease. RECENT FINDINGS: New formulations of cytotoxic agents, namely CPX-351 and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, improve the outcome of defined subgroup of patients. Midostaurin added to intensive chemotherapy is approved in FLT3-mutated AML. More selective FLT3 inhibitors and the IDH inhibitors enasidenib and ivosidenib have shown significant single agent activity in the relapsed setting, and preliminary results of combination strategies are encouraging. The addition of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax appears to markedly improve the results of hypomethylating agents. The therapeutic armamentarium of AML now includes novel cytotoxic drugs, drugs targeting recurrent oncogenes, or functional vulnerabilities of leukemic cells. Further work is required to optimize their integration to the current framework of AML management, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Cerrano, Marco', 'Itzykson, Raphael']","['Cerrano M', 'Itzykson R']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Universita degli studi di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France. raphael.itzykson@aphp.fr.', 'INSERM/CNRS UMR 944/7212, Paris Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), Paris, France. raphael.itzykson@aphp.fr.', 'INSERM/CNRS UMR 944/7212, Hematology Department, Hopital Saint-Louis, Hopitaux de Paris, Universite Paris Diderot, Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010, Paris, France. raphael.itzykson@aphp.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190204,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-019-0764-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-019-0764-8 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2019 Feb 4;21(2):16. doi: 10.1007/s11912-019-0764-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*BCL2 inhibitors', '*FLT3 inhibitors', '*Hypomethylating agents', '*IDH inhibitors', '*Targeted therapy']",,,,,,20200622,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']","['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, the standard approach for eligible patients has been high-dose induction chemotherapy preferably with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-based regimens followed by consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Unfortunately, many patients with this disease are elderly and/or frail and cannot tolerate this therapy, and the low-dose regimens being used in this population are generally not as effective. However, this paradigm may be changing with the advent of newer targeted therapies, particularly the exploitation of CD123. SL-401 has shown very promising results with manageable toxicities and durable responses and appears to be a viable option for elderly or frail patients who are not eligible for transplant. The other CD123-directed therapies, especially chimeric antigen receptor-therapy (CAR-T), may also give promising results in trials that are currently underway. CAR-T has shown promise in a number of other hematologic malignancies, and toxicities have become more manageable as its use is becoming more widespread. While SL-401 has shown potential to provide durable responses even without transplant, we do not yet know whether it will be effective as a means to avoid transplant in patients who are otherwise eligible. All transplant-eligible patients should undergo alloHSCT consolidation given the current available data indicating this is the optimal approach to achieve a long-term remission. Once the CD123-directed therapies are established as standard regimens, future studies may be designed to investigate whether these therapies can be utilized without the use of transplant. Furthermore, combination therapy using anti-CD123 agents with high-dose induction chemotherapy or other low-dose regimens for elderly/frail patients should be investigated. Given the promising results in early clinical trials, it appears CD123 is the most viable target for BPDCN, and future studies should continue to exploit its expression on BPDCN cells.","['Kerr, Daniel 2nd', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Sokol, Lubomir']","['Kerr D 2nd', 'Zhang L', 'Sokol L']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center/University of South Florida, 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL, 33612, USA.

RECENT FINDINGS: Bispecific antibodies are molecules able to target two different antigen-binding sites: one towards a tumor antigen and another to activate a cytotoxic cell. Phase II/III trials on blinatumomab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have demonstrated its efficacy for treating minimal residual disease (MRD+) and relapsed refractory (r/r) Philadelphia positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph-) ALL in adults and children. Currently, the only bispecific antibody (bsAb) approved for its use in hematologic malignancies is blinatumomab. However, multiple trials are under development not only to explore blinatumomab's clinical activity in other neoplasia, such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma, but also to develop new molecules against different antigens.","['Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta', 'Perez-Samano, Daniela', 'Bourlon, Christianne']","['Demichelis-Gomez R', 'Perez-Samano D', 'Bourlon C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga No. 15, Belisario Dominguez Seccion XVI, Tlalpan, 14080, Mexico City, Mexico. robertademichelis@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga No. 15, Belisario Dominguez Seccion XVI, Tlalpan, 14080, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga No. 15, Belisario Dominguez Seccion XVI, Tlalpan, 14080, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190204,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-019-0759-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-019-0759-5 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2019 Feb 4;21(2):17. doi: 10.1007/s11912-019-0759-5.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Antibodies', '*Antineoplastic agents', '*Bispecific antibodies', '*Immunotherapy', '*T-lymphocytes']",,,,,,20200622,IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']","['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adipocytes prevent the production of normal HSCs via secretion of inflammatory factors, and adipocyte-derived free fatty acids may contribute to the development and progression of leukemia via providing energy for leukemic cells. In addition, adipocytes are able to metabolize and inactivate therapeutic agents, reducing the concentrations of active drugs in adipocyte-rich microenvironments. The aim of this study was to detect the role of adipocytes in the progression and treatment of leukemia. Relevant literature was identified through a PubMed search (2000-2018) of English-language papers using the following terms: leukemia, adipocyte, leukemic stem cell, chemotherapy, and bone marrow. Findings suggest the striking interplay between leukemic cells and adipocytes to create a unique microenvironment supporting the metabolic demands and survival of leukemic cells. Based on these findings, targeting lipid metabolism of leukemic cells and adipocytes in combination with standard therapeutic agents might present novel treatment options.","['Samimi, Azin', 'Ghanavat, Majid', 'Shahrabi, Saeid', 'Azizidoost, Shirin', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Samimi A', 'Ghanavat M', 'Shahrabi S', 'Azizidoost S', 'Saki N']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Child Growth and Development Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Research Institute of Health, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. najmaldinsaki@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190204,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/07/06 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00018-019-03031-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00018-019-03031-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2019 Jul;76(13):2489-2497. doi: 10.1007/s00018-019-03031-6.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Overall, ART-conceived children do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Despite the increasing use of ART, i.e. IVF or ICSI worldwide, information about possible long-term health risks for children conceived by these techniques is scarce. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A nationwide historical cohort study with prospective follow-up (median 21 years), including all live-born offspring from women treated with subfertility treatments between 1980 and 2001. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All offspring of a nationwide cohort of subfertile women (OMEGA study) treated in one of the 12 Dutch IVF clinics or two fertility clinics. Of 47 690 live-born children, 24 269 were ART-conceived, 13 761 naturally conceived and 9660 were conceived naturally or through fertility drugs, but not by ART. Information on the conception method of each child and potential confounders were collected through the mothers' questionnaires and medical records. Cancer incidence was ascertained through linkage with The Netherlands Cancer Registry from 1 January 1989 until 1 November 2016. Cancer risk in ART-conceived children was compared with risks in naturally conceived children from subfertile women (hazard ratios [HRs]) and with the general population (standardized incidence ratios [SIRs]). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median follow-up was 21 years (interquartile range (IQR): 17-25) and was shorter in ART-conceived children (20 years, IQR: 17-23) compared with naturally conceived children (24 years, IQR: 20-30). In total, 231 cancers were observed. Overall cancer risk was not increased in ART-conceived children, neither compared with naturally conceived children from subfertile women (HR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.72-1.38) nor compared with the general population (SIR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.90-1.36). From 18 years of age onwards, the HR of cancer in ART-conceived versus naturally conceived individuals was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.73-2.13). Slightly but non-significantly increased risks were observed in children conceived by ICSI or cryopreservation (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 0.81-2.85; 1.80, 95% CI: 0.65-4.95, respectively). Risks of lymphoblastic leukemia (HR = 2.44, 95% CI: 0.81-7.37) and melanoma (HR = 1.86, 95% CI: 0.66-5.27) were non-significantly increased for ART-conceived compared with naturally conceived children. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Despite the large size and long follow-up of the cohort, the number of cancers was rather small for subgroup analyses as cancer in children and young adults is rare. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Overall, ART-conceived children do not appear to have an increased cancer risk after a median follow-up of 21 years. This large study provides important results, enabling physicians to better inform couples considering ART about the long-term safety of ART for their children. However, larger studies with prolonged follow-up are needed to investigate cancer risk in adults and in children conceived by ICSI and/or from cryopreserved embryos.

It is important to examine how epidemiological characteristics, clinical and treatment factors, cytogenetic and genetic data affect survival and differ between APL and non-APL AML patients. We analyzed population data from the New York State Cancer Registry to characterize AML including APL incidence rates by demographics. APL incidence rates were higher among Hispanics than non-Hispanics [incidence rate ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.43]; and among foreign-born than USA-born persons. APL incidence rates increased more rapidly through 1995-2014 than non-APL AML; and its frequency increased faster among foreign-born persons. In a hospital cohort of 390 AML patients, the risk of death was significantly higher among APL patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplications than those without [hazard ratio (HR) = 11.74; 95% CI = 1.03-134.5]; and among APL patients with secondary versus de novo disease (HR = 17.32; 95% CI = 1.56-192.1). Among non-APL AML patients, risk of death was significantly associated with prior chemotherapy with antitubulin agents after adjusting for age, gender and ethnicity (adjusted HR = 3.30; 95% CI = 1.49-7.32); and separately with older age, unfavorable cytogenetics and complex karyotype. This study highlights FLT3-internal tandem duplications as a prognostic factor in APL and proposes consideration of prior antitubulin therapy as a prognostic factor in non-APL AML.","['Kamath, Geetanjali R', 'Tremblay, Douglas', 'Coltoff, Alexander', 'Caro, Jessica', 'Lancman, Guido', 'Bhalla, Sheena', 'Najfeld, Vesna', 'Mascarenhas, John', 'Taioli, Emanuela']","['Kamath GR', 'Tremblay D', 'Coltoff A', 'Caro J', 'Lancman G', 'Bhalla S', 'Najfeld V', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Taioli E']","['The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Institute for Translational Epidemiology and Department of Population Health Science and Policy, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Institute for Translational Epidemiology and Department of Population Health Science and Policy, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,PMC6610162,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['5306143 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgz014 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2019 Jul 4;40(5):651-660. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgz014.,,,['P30 CA196521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,20200320,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Ethnicity/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

A newly described antibody was recently used to distinguish normal peripheral blood T cells from malignant T-cell clones. Here, we evaluate this antibody as a new diagnostic tool for detecting T-cell clonality in mature peripheral T-cell lymphomas. METHODS: Immunostaining for the T-cell receptor beta chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) along with routine T-cell markers was performed on 51 peripheral blood and two bone marrow samples submitted to the flow cytometry laboratory for suspected T-cell malignancy. RESULTS: TRBC immunophenotyping identified malignant T-cell clones with 97% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Findings correlated with molecular T-cell clonality testing. In cases with equivocal molecular results, TRBC1 immunophenotyping provided additional diagnostic information. CONCLUSIONS: TRBC1 flow cytometric immunophenotyping is a robust and inexpensive method for identifying T-cell clonality that could easily be incorporated into routine flow cytometric practice.","['Novikov, Natasha D', 'Griffin, Gabriel K', 'Dudley, Graham', 'Drew, Mai', 'Rojas-Rudilla, Vanesa', 'Lindeman, Neal I', 'Dorfman, David M']","['Novikov ND', 'Griffin GK', 'Dudley G', 'Drew M', 'Rojas-Rudilla V', 'Lindeman NI', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/02/13 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['5304721 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqy173 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Apr 2;151(5):494-503. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqy173.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Sezary syndrome', '*T-LGL leukemia', '*T-cell receptor beta chain', '*TRBC1']",,,,,,20200212,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/analysis', 'Reference Values']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Classically, fludarabine (Flu) is an effective drug used as a first-line therapy for CLL; however, Flu resistance limits its clinical effect. Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex components 2-7 exert important functions in maintaining genomic stability. Replication stress occurs upon dysregulation of MCM7, which potentiates malignant phenotypes. In this study, primary CLL cells and CLL-derived cell lines displayed elevated MCM7 expression. In CD40-stimulated primary CLL cells, MCM7 inhibition resulted in increased Flu-induced apoptosis and delayed repair of DNA damage. In the MEC-1 and EHEB cell lines, knockdown of MCM7 with lentivirus significantly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell cycle arrest at S phase. Moreover, MCM7 silencing sensitized both cell lines to Flu by increasing replication stress.

Of the three case patients, case 1 relapsed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After being treated with anti-CD19 CAR-T, the patient showed minimal residual disease (MRD), and his fusion genes turned negative. Case 2, who suffered refractory leukemia, received anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment in an attempt to remove the MRD before transplantation. She showed MRD, and her fusion genes turned negative. Case 3 received anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment because of relapse after allo-SCT at the molecular level. After infusion, she developed severe pneumonia accompanied with the indication that the leukemia had progressed. Our findings suggest that anti-CD19 CAR-T cells therapy with a remarkable MRD eradicating ability might be an effective option for patients with relapsed and refractory E2A-PBX1 positive B-ALL.","['Zhang, Jian', 'Yang, Fei', 'Qiu, Hui-Ying', 'Wu, Qian', 'Kong, Dan-Qing', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Han, Yue', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Zhang J', 'Yang F', 'Qiu HY', 'Wu Q', 'Kong DQ', 'Zhou J', 'Han Y', 'Wu DP']","['a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190204,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1533127 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Jun;60(6):1454-1461. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1533127.

Here, we investigated monozygotic twins with the same de novo mutation in GATA2 but different phenotypes. The patient suffering a bleeding tendency was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and her monozygotic twin showed dysmegakaryopoietic features in the bone marrow. Targeted sequencing revealed the same germline mutation in GATA2, c.1192C > T, in both sisters and different somatic mutations in 14 genes between the sisters. The GATA2 mutation was absent in both parents, and their hemograms were normal. The methylation profile of the GATA2 promoter region was different between the twins, showing denser promoter methylation in the patient, correlated with MDS. Thus, we concluded that the twins had acquired a de novo GATA2 mutation but showed different phenotypes, possibly due to the critical role of epigenetic changes.","['Kim, Namhee', 'Choi, Seongmin', 'Kim, Sung-Min', 'Lee, Amos Chungwon', 'Im, Kyongok', 'Park, Hee Sue', 'Kim, Jung-Ah', 'Kim, Kwangsoo', 'Kim, Inho', 'Chang, Yoon Hwan', 'Lee, Dong Soon']","['Kim N', 'Choi S', 'Kim SM', 'Lee AC', 'Im K', 'Park HS', 'Kim JA', 'Kim K', 'Kim I', 'Chang YH', 'Lee DS']","['a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'b Division of Clinical Bioinformatics Biomedical Research Institute , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'c Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'd Interdisciplinary program of Bioengineering , Seoul National University , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'c Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'b Division of Clinical Bioinformatics Biomedical Research Institute , Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'e Department of Internal Medicine , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'f Department of Laboratory Medicine , Korea Cancer Center Hospital , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.', 'c Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190204,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1516039 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Apr;60(4):1053-1061. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1516039.

These cells reside within the CD34(+) /CD38( horizontal line ) /Lin( horizontal line ) fraction and score positive for CD26 (dipeptidylpeptidase IV) a marker, expressed in both bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples, that discriminates CML cells from normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or from LSCs of other myeloid neoplasms. CD26 evaluation could be a useful tool to improve the identification of CML LCSs by using flow-cytometry assay. METHODS: CD26(+) LSCs have been isolated from EDTA PB and BM samples of patients with leucocytosis suspected for CML. Analysis of LSCs CML has been performed by using custom-made lyophilized pre-titrated antibody mixture test and control tube and a CD45(+) /CD34(+) /CD38(-) /CD26(+) panel as a strict flow cytometric gating strategy. RESULTS: The expression of CD26 on CD34(+) /CD38(-) population was detectable in 211/211 PB and 84/84 BM samples of subsequently confirmed BCR-ABL(+) CP-CML patients. None of the 32 samples suspicious for CML but scoring negative for circulating CD26(+) LSCs were diagnosed as CML after conventional cytogenetic and molecular testing. To validate our results, we checked for PB CD26(+) LSCs in patients affected by other hematological disorders and they all scored negative for CD26 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We propose flow cytometry evaluation of CD26 expression on PB CD34(+) /CD38(-) population as a new rapid, reproducible, and powerful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of CML.

Some reports suggested that ovarian function may be better preserved in females undergoing HSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) than with conventional myeloablative conditioning (MAC). However, the impact of HSCT after 8-Gy TBI-based reduced-toxicity MAC (RTMAC), whose efficacy is between those of conventional MAC and RIC, on ovarian function remains unclear. PROCEDURE: A single-center retrospective analysis of data derived from patient information for all the children who underwent transplantation at the Shinshu University Hospital was carried out. Patients who underwent 8-Gy total body irradiation (TBI)-based RTMAC before HSCT were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 36% (five of 14) of the patients developed primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) during the observation period, but serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels reduced to normal range with spontaneous menstruation in two, implying the reversal of POI. Furthermore, only one (10%) of the 10 prepubertal patients (71%; 10/14) at the time of HSCT suffered from POI at the last observation, but all three post-pubertal patients developed POI (100%), and two (67%) continued to suffer from POI at the last observation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, 8-Gy TBI-based RTMAC before HSCT may decrease the possibility of POI compared with conventional MAC, especially in prepubertal patients. A longer follow-up will be required to ascertain whether a normal pregnancy and delivery can occur in such patients.","['Komori, Kazutoshi', 'Hirabayashi, Koichi', 'Morita, Daisuke', 'Hara, Yosuke', 'Kurata, Takashi', 'Saito, Shoji', 'Tanaka, Miyuki', 'Yanagisawa, Ryu', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Nakazawa, Yozo']","['Komori K', 'Hirabayashi K', 'Morita D', 'Hara Y', 'Kurata T', 'Saito S', 'Tanaka M', 'Yanagisawa R', 'Sakashita K', 'Koike K', 'Nakazawa Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190203,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/03/26 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13372 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2019 May;23(3):e13372. doi: 10.1111/petr.13372.

Specific subgroups, such as high hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes or DNA Index >/=1.16) and hypodiploidy (<45 chromosomes), predict outcome of patients after primary treatment. Whether aneuploidy has a prognostic value for relapsed disease is yet to be determined. Using DNA index and centromere screening by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we investigated aneuploidy in 413 children treated for first relapse of B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol. Ten-year event-free survival of patients with high hyperdiploid relapses approached 70%, whereas it was only 40% in low hyperdiploid relapses. Three patients with apparent hyperdiploid relapse had TP53 mutations. In these cases, array-based allelotyping revealed a hypodiploid origin with absence of the hypodiploid founder clone (masked hypodiploidy). Collectively, patients with evident or masked hypodiploid relapses showed an extremely low event-free survival rate of 9%. Importantly, the current relapse risk stratification did not identify cases with masked hypodiploidy as high-risk patients, due to their favourable clinical presentation. In multivariate analysis, hypodiploidy proved to be an independent prognostic factor. This finding supports stratification of relapses with hypodiploid origin into high-risk arms in future trials or allocation of patients to alternative treatment approaches.","['Groeneveld-Krentz, Stefanie', 'Schroeder, Michael P', 'Reiter, Michael', 'Pogodzinski, Malwine J', 'Pimentel-Gutierrez, Helia J', 'Vagkopoulou, Renia', 'Hof, Jana', 'Chen-Santel, Christiane', 'Nebral, Karin', 'Bradtke, Jutta', 'Turkmen, Seval', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Gattenlohner, Stefan', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Kirschner-Schwabe, Renate']","['Groeneveld-Krentz S', 'Schroeder MP', 'Reiter M', 'Pogodzinski MJ', 'Pimentel-Gutierrez HJ', 'Vagkopoulou R', 'Hof J', 'Chen-Santel C', 'Nebral K', 'Bradtke J', 'Turkmen S', 'Baldus CD', 'Gattenlohner S', 'Haas OA', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Karawajew L', 'Eckert C', 'Kirschner-Schwabe R']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology/Oncology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Visual Computing & Human-Centered Technology, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany.', 'Labor Berlin Charite Vivantes, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Human Genetics, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology/Oncology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), and German Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), and German Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190203,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15770 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Apr;185(2):266-283. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15770.

Previously we showed that Pomalidomide (Pom) increases surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-infected latent and lytic cells and restores ICAM-1 and B7-2 in latent cells. We explored the ability of Pom to increase immune surface marker expression in cells infected by other chronic viruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papilloma virus (HPV), Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCV), and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Pom increased MHC-1, ICAM-1, and B7-2/CD86 in immortalized T-cell lines productively infected with HTLV-1 and also significantly increased their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Pom enhancement of MHC-I and ICAM-1 in primary cells infected with HTLV-1 was abrogated by knockout of HTLV-1 orf-1. Pom increased expression of ICAM-1, B7-2 and MHC class I polypeptide related sequence A (MICA) surface expression in the EBV-infected Daudi cells and increased their T-cell activation and susceptibility to NK cells. Moreover, Pom increased expression of certain of these surface markers on Akata, Raji, and EBV lymphoblastic cell lines. The increased expression of immune surface markers in these virus-infected lines was generally associated with a decrease in IRF4 expression. By contrast, Pom treatment of HPV, MCV and HIV-1 infected cells did not increase these immune surface markers. Pom and related drugs may be clinically beneficial for the treatment of HTLV-1 and EBV-induced tumors by rendering infected cells more susceptible to both innate and adaptive host immune responses.","['Davis, David A', 'Shrestha, Prabha', 'Aisabor, Ashley I', 'Stream, Alexandra', 'Galli, Veronica', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Tagawa, Takanobu', 'Ziegelbauer, Joseph M', 'Franchini, Genoveffa', 'Yarchoan, Robert']","['Davis DA', 'Shrestha P', 'Aisabor AI', 'Stream A', 'Galli V', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Tagawa T', 'Ziegelbauer JM', 'Franchini G', 'Yarchoan R']","['HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181205,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC6343774,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/02/05 06:01,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1546544 [doi]', '1546544 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Dec 5;8(2):e1546544. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1546544. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD86', '*ICAM-1', '*Natural killer (NK) cells', '*T cells', '*epstein barr virus (EBV)', '*human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', '*ikaros (IKZF1).', '*interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)', '*major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)', '*pomalidomide']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3057-1395'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their activation using the glycolipid alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) triggers innate and adaptive immune responses. The use of alpha-GalCer in preclinical models as a single antitumor treatment showed moderate effect, but its efficacy in cancer patients was less effective. In addition, this glycolipid induces long-term iNKT-cell anergy precluding the possibility of retreatment. Recently, the first murine iNKT-cell agonistic antibody, NKT14m, has been developed. Here, we analyzed, for the first time, the antitumor efficacy of NKT14m in a B-cell lymphoma model. In a therapeutic setting, a single dose of NKT14m had a moderate antitumor efficacy that was associated with an increase of IFN-gamma producing iNKT cells even after a second dose of the NKT14m antibody. Importantly, the combination of a single dose of NKT14m with cyclophosphamide had a potent antitumor efficacy and long-lasting immunity in vivo. Our findings provide the first evidence of the in vivo antitumor efficacy of NKT14m antibody, showing that, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, induces an effective antitumor response. These results open new opportunities for iNKT-cell mediated immunotherapy to treat B-cell lymphoma.","['Escriba-Garcia, Laura', 'Alvarez-Fernandez, Carmen', 'Caballero, Ana Carolina', 'Schaub, Robert', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Briones, Javier']","['Escriba-Garcia L', 'Alvarez-Fernandez C', 'Caballero AC', 'Schaub R', 'Sierra J', 'Briones J']","['Hematology Service, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology-IIB, Institut Recerca Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology-IIB, Institut Recerca Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology-IIB, Institut Recerca Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'NKT Therapeutics Inc, Sharon, MA (USA).', 'Hematology Service, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Autonomous University, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology-IIB, Institut Recerca Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Autonomous University, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181126,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC6343796,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/02/05 06:01,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1546543 [doi]', '1546543 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Nov 26;8(2):e1546543. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1546543. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell lymphoma', '*Inkt cells', '*NKT14m', '*antibody', '*immunotherapy']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4950-5259', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6375-596X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, almost half of the patients fail to respond due to immune evasive mechanism. A known mechanism is the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression, which prevents T cell recognition of the tumor. This study determined the relationship between natural killer (NK) cell numbers and clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma. Experimental Design: Twenty-five anti-PD-1 treated metastatic melanoma patients were categorized into responders (complete response (CR)/partial response (PR)/stable disease (SD) >/= 6 mo, n = 13) and non-responders (SD < 6 days/progressive disease (PD), n = 12) based on RECIST response. Whole transcriptome sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescent staining were performed on pre-treatment and on a subset of early during treatment tumor samples. Spatial distribution analysis was performed on multiplex immunofluorescent images to determine the proximity of NK cells to tumor cells. Flow cytometry was used to confirm NK phenotypes in lymph node metastases of treatment naive melanoma patients (n = 5). Cytotoxic assay was performed using NK cells treated with anti-PD-1 or with isotype control and co-cultured with 3 different melanoma cell lines and with K562 cells (leukemia cell line). Results: Differential expression analysis identified nine upregulated NK cell specific genes (adjusted p < 0.05) in responding (n = 11) versus non-responding patients (n = 10). Immunofluorescent staining of biopsies confirmed a significantly higher density of intra- and peri-tumoral CD16+ and granzyme B + NK cells in responding patients (p < 0.05). Interestingly, NK cells were in closer proximity to tumor cells in responding PD-1 treated patients compared to non-responding patients. Patients who responded to anti-PD-1 therapy, despite MHC class I loss had higher NK cell densities than patients with low MHC class I expression. Lastly, functional assays demonstrated PD-1 blockade induces an increase in NK cells' cytotoxicity. Conclusions: A higher density of tumoral NK cells is associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. NK cells may play an important role in mediating response to anti-PD-1 therapy, including in a subset of tumors downregulating MHC class I expression.","['Lee, Hansol', 'Quek, Camelia', 'Silva, Ines', 'Tasker, Annie', 'Batten, Marcel', 'Rizos, Helen', 'Lim, Su Yin', 'Nur Gide, Tuba', 'Shang, Ping', 'Attrill, Grace H', 'Madore, Jason', 'Edwards, Jarem', 'Carlino, Matteo S', 'Guminski, Alexander', 'Saw, Robyn P M', 'Thompson, John F', 'Ferguson, Peter M', 'Palendira, Umaimainthan', 'Menzies, Alexander M', 'Long, Georgina V', 'Scolyer, Richard A', 'Wilmott, James S']","['Lee H', 'Quek C', 'Silva I', 'Tasker A', 'Batten M', 'Rizos H', 'Lim SY', 'Nur Gide T', 'Shang P', 'Attrill GH', 'Madore J', 'Edwards J', 'Carlino MS', 'Guminski A', 'Saw RPM', 'Thompson JF', 'Ferguson PM', 'Palendira U', 'Menzies AM', 'Long GV', 'Scolyer RA', 'Wilmott JS']","['Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Crown Princess Mary Cancer Centre, Westmead and Blacktown Hospitals, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Northern Sydney Cancer Centre, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Tissue Pathology and Diagnostic Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Tissue Pathology and Diagnostic Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Tissue Pathology and Diagnostic Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Discipline of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Northern Sydney Cancer Centre, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Northern Sydney Cancer Centre, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Tissue Pathology and Diagnostic Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney Central Clinical School, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181031,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC6343795,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/02/05 06:01,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1537581 [doi]', '1537581 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Oct 31;8(2):e1537581. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1537581. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['*MHC class I', '*Melanoma', '*NK cells', '*anti-PD-1 therapy']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6270-1203', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8894-3545', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6750-5244']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though patients with UM IGHV have a poor prognosis and generally require earlier treatment, not all UM IGHV patients experience more rapid disease progression with some remaining treatment free for many years. This observation suggests biologic characteristics other than known prognostic factors influence disease progression. Alterations in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression levels have been implicated in diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers, however, their role in disease progression of early Rai stage UM CLL is unknown. Here we use microarray analysis to compare lncRNA and mRNA profiles of Rai 0/I UM IGHV patients who progressed in <2 years relative to patients who had not progressed for >5 years. Over 1,300 lncRNAs and 940 mRNAs were differentially expressed (fold change >/= 2.0; p-value </= 0.05). Of interest, the differentially expressed lncRNAs T204050, NR_002947, and uc.436+, have known associated genes that have been linked to CLL. Thus, our study reveals differentially expressed lncRNAs in progressive early stage CLL requiring therapy versus indolent early Rai stage UM CLL. These lncRNAs have the potential to impact relevant biological processes and pathways that influence clinical outcome in CLL.","['Tschumper, Renee C', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Jelinek, Diane F']","['Tschumper RC', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190101,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6343752,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],2019/02/05 06:00,2019/02/05 06:01,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26538 [doi]', '26538 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Jan 1;10(1):60-75. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26538. eCollection 2019 Jan 1.,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'early Rai stage', 'long non-coding RNA', 'progression', 'unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region']",['R21 CA191380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib inhibits BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase produced due to reciprocal translocation t(9;22) in neoplastic CML cells. It reduces hyperproliferation of myeloid precursors and has been found to affect bone marrow fibrosis and angiogenesis. This study was done to assess the effect of imatinib on bone marrow morphology and angiogenesis in CML. Methods: 31 newly diagnosed CML patients were evaluated before and after 3 months of imatinib therapy. A marrow morphological response (MMR) score was used to assess marrow cytological and histological features including grade of fibrosis. Mean microvessel density (MVD) was also assessed. Hematological parameters and BCR-ABL transcript levels were assessed in the peripheral blood. Results: 86.21% of patients showed decrease in marrow cellularity with normalization of M:E ratio. 72.42% of patients had decrease in grade of fibrosis and 17.24% showed no change while 10.34% of patients showed progression of fibrosis grade. Patients with MMR score >/= 2 (n=4) and those with progression of fibrosis grade (n=3) showed suboptimal molecular response (BCR-ABL transcripts > 10%). Pretherapy mean MVD of patients (14.69 +/- 5.28) was higher than that of controls (6.32 +/- 1.64). A significant reduction of 66.51% was observed in posttherapy mean MVD (4.98 +/- 2.77) of CML patients (p<0.001). Conclusion: Imatinib therapy in CML not only decreases marrow cellularity, but also helps towards normalization of bone marrow microenvironment by reducing fibrosis and angiogenesis.","['Pandey, Neetu', 'Yadav, Geeta', 'Kushwaha, Rashmi', 'Verma, Shailendra Prasad', 'Singh, Uma Shankar', 'Kumar, Ashutosh', 'Mishra, Prabhaker']","['Pandey N', 'Yadav G', 'Kushwaha R', 'Verma SP', 'Singh US', 'Kumar A', 'Mishra P']","[""Department of Pathology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, U.P. 226003, India."", ""Department of Pathology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, U.P. 226003, India."", ""Department of Pathology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, U.P. 226003, India."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, U.P. 226003, India."", ""Department of Pathology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, U.P. 226003, India."", ""Department of Pathology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, U.P. 226003, India."", 'Department of Biostatistics & Health Informatics, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate of Medical Sciences, Raebareli Road, Lucknow, U.P. 226014, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190101,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,PMC6332991,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/02/05 06:01,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1835091 [doi]'],epublish,Adv Hematol. 2019 Jan 1;2019:1835091. doi: 10.1155/2019/1835091. eCollection 2019.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4471-7762', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8193-8436']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While CAR T cells are considered as major breakthrough in the field of cancer immunotherapy, the regulation of CAR T cells remains poorly understood. In this review we will discuss the strategies that regulate the CAR T cells efficacy and persistence with focus on roles of different structural component of CAR construct. Different domains of CAR construct, for example, antigen binding domain, hinge, transmembrane, and signaling domain as well as immune-regulatory cytokines have significant impact on CAR T cell efficacy.

Therefore, new therapeutics are much needed. Here, we present a novel therapeutic strategy targeting PR1, an HLA-A2 restricted myeloid leukemia antigen. Previously, we have developed and characterized a novel T-cell receptor-like monoclonal antibody (8F4) that targets PR1/HLA-A2 and eliminates AML xenografts by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). To improve the potency of 8F4, we adopted a strategy to link T-cell cytotoxicity with a bi-specific T-cell-engaging antibody that binds PR1/HLA-A2 on leukemia and CD3 on neighboring T-cells. The 8F4 bi-specific antibody maintained high affinity and specific binding to PR1/HLA-A2 comparable to parent 8F4 antibody, shown by flow cytometry and Bio-Layer Interferometry. In addition, 8F4 bi-specific antibody activated donor T-cells in the presence of HLA-A2(+) primary AML blasts and cell lines in a dose dependent manner. Importantly, activated T-cells lysed HLA-A2(+) primary AML blasts and cell lines after addition of 8F4 bi-specific antibody. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a novel bi-specific antibody targeting the PR1/HLA-A2 leukemia-associated antigen, justifying further clinical development of this strategy.","['Herrmann, Amanda C', 'Im, Jin S', 'Pareek, Sumedha', 'Ruiz-Vasquez, Wilfredo', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Sergeeva, Anna', 'Mehrens, Jennifer', 'He, Hong', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Sukhumalchandra, Pariya', 'St John, Lisa', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Zha, Dongxing', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Herrmann AC', 'Im JS', 'Pareek S', 'Ruiz-Vasquez W', 'Lu S', 'Sergeeva A', 'Mehrens J', 'He H', 'Alatrash G', 'Sukhumalchandra P', 'St John L', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Zha D', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Oncology Research for Biologics and Immunotherapy Translation Platform, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Oncology Research for Biologics and Immunotherapy Translation Platform, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190118,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC6345694,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/10/15 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03153 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jan 18;9:3153. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03153. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*PR1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*bi-specific antibody', '*cancer immunotherapy', '*re-directed cytotoxicity']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,20191014,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetulus', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']","['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated whether RNA-binding to cationic domains influences the immunogenicity of endogenously expressed antigens delivered by DNA vaccination. We initially evaluated induction of HBV-C (K(b)/C93)-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in C57BL/6J (B6) and 1.4HBV-S(mut) transgenic (tg) mice that harbor a replicating HBV genome in hepatocytes by DNA immunization. RNA-binding HBV-C and HBV-C149tat antigens moderately enhanced K(b)/C93-specific CD8(+) T cells in B6 mice as compared with RNA-free HBV-C149 antigen (lacking cationic domains). However, only the RNA-binding antigens elicited K(b)/C93-specific CD8(+) T cells that inhibited HBV replication in 1.4HBV-S(mut) tg mice. Moreover, RNA-binding to designer antigens, which express a K(b)/p15E epitope from an endogenous murine leukemia virus-derived tumor-specific gp70 protein, was crucial to prime tumor-rejecting effector CD8(+) T cells in B6 mice. Antigen-bound endogenous RNAs function as a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) ligand and stimulated priming of K(b)/p15E-specific CD8(+) T cells in B6, but not TLR-7(-/-), mice. Antigen-bound cellular RNAs thus function as an endogenous natural adjuvant in in vivo vector-transfected cells, and thus are an attractive tool to induce and/or enhance effector CD8(+) T cell responses directed against chronic viral infections or tumor self-antigens by DNA vaccination.","['Krieger, Jana', 'Riedl, Petra', 'Stifter, Katja', 'Roman-Sosa, Gleyder', 'Seufferlein, Thomas', 'Wagner, Martin', 'Schirmbeck, Reinhold']","['Krieger J', 'Riedl P', 'Stifter K', 'Roman-Sosa G', 'Seufferlein T', 'Wagner M', 'Schirmbeck R']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Hospital, Albert Einstein Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Hospital, Albert Einstein Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Hospital, Albert Einstein Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Hospital, Albert Einstein Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Hospital, Albert Einstein Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Hospital, Albert Einstein Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Hospital, Albert Einstein Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.

Although BLV is widespread in Chinese cows with the positive rate of 49.1% at the individual level, very little is known about the BLV genotype in dairy cattle in China. To determine BLV genetic variability in cows in China, 112 BLV-positive samples from 5 cities in China were used for BLV molecular characterization in this study. Phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method on partial env sequence encoding gp51 obtained from 5 Chinese cities and those available in GenBank (n = 53, representing BLV genotype 1-10) revealed the Chinese strains belonged to genotype 6. Seven unique SNP were identified among Yancheng, Shanghai, and Bengbu strains out of the total 12 SNP identified in Chinese strains. The genotyping coupled with SNP analysis of BLV can serve as a useful molecular epidemiological tool for tracing the source of pathogens. This study highlights the importance of genetic analysis of geographically diverse BLV strains to understand BLV global genetic diversity.","['Yang, Y', 'Chu, S', 'Shang, S', 'Yang, Z', 'Wang, C']","['Yang Y', 'Chu S', 'Shang S', 'Yang Z', 'Wang C']","['Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China; International Corporation Laboratory of Agriculture and Agricultural Products Safety, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China.

Here, we show that conditional expression of Sf3b1-K700E mutation in mouse B cells disrupts pre-mRNA splicing, alters cell development, and induces a state of cellular senescence. Combination with Atm deletion leads to the overcoming of cellular senescence and the development of CLL-like disease in elderly mice. These CLL-like cells show genome instability and dysregulation of multiple CLL-associated cellular processes, including deregulated B cell receptor signaling, which we also identified in human CLL cases. Notably, human CLLs harboring SF3B1 mutations exhibit altered response to BTK inhibition. Our murine model of CLL thus provides insights into human CLL disease mechanisms and treatment.","['Yin, Shanye', 'Gambe, Rutendo G', 'Sun, Jing', 'Martinez, Aina Zurita', 'Cartun, Zachary J', 'Regis, Fara Faye D', 'Wan, Youzhong', 'Fan, Jean', 'Brooks, Angela N', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Taylor-Weiner, Amaro', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Obeng, Esther A', 'Cibulskis, Carrie L', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Campagna, Dean R', 'Fleming, Mark D', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Leshchiner, Ignaty', 'DeCaprio, James A', 'Getz, Gad', 'Reed, Robin', 'Carrasco, Ruben D', 'Wu, Catherine J', 'Wang, Lili']","['Yin S', 'Gambe RG', 'Sun J', 'Martinez AZ', 'Cartun ZJ', 'Regis FFD', 'Wan Y', 'Fan J', 'Brooks AN', 'Herman SEM', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Taylor-Weiner A', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Ghia EM', 'Kipps TJ', 'Obeng EA', 'Cibulskis CL', 'Neuberg D', 'Campagna DR', 'Fleming MD', 'Ebert BL', 'Wiestner A', 'Leshchiner I', 'DeCaprio JA', 'Getz G', 'Reed R', 'Carrasco RD', 'Wu CJ', 'Wang L']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

For example, the Top Scoring Pair (TSP) method seeks to find pairs of genes so that the probability of the reversal of the relative ranking of the expression levels of the genes in the two classes is maximized. The computational cost of finding a q-tuple of genes that scores highest under a given metric is O(G(q)), where G is the total number of genes. This cost is often problematic or prohibitive in practice (even for q=2), as the number of genes G is often in the order of tens of thousands. METHODS: In this paper, we show that this computational cost can be significantly reduced by excluding from consideration genes whose behavior is almost identical in the two classes and therefore their inclusion in any q-tuple is rather non-informative. Our criterion for the exclusion of genes is supported by a statistically robust metric, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. By filtering out genes whose AUC value is below a user-chosen threshold, as determined by a procedure that we describe in the paper, dramatic reductions in the run times are obtained while maintaining the same classification accuracy. RESULTS: We have experimentally verified the gains of this approach on several case studies involving ovarian, colon, leukemia, breast and prostate cancers, and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is not only faster (for example, we observed an average 78.65% reduction over the run time of TSP) while maintaining the same classification accuracy, but it can even result in better classification accuracy due to its inherent ability to avoid the so-called ""pivot"" (non-informative) genes that may intrude in q-tuples chosen otherwise.","['Khamesipour, Alireza', 'Kagaris, Dimitri']","['Khamesipour A', 'Kagaris D']","['ECE Dept., Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA.', 'ECE Dept., Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA.

Although meta-analyses have estimated cancer incidence in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, results have been inconclusive. Hence, we aimed to assess malignancy risk in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, compared to the risk in the general population. METHODS: Systemic lupus erythematosus patients ( n = 21,016; mean age 41.67 +/- 13.14 years; female 90.22%) were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2008 and 2014. Age- and sex-matched controls were randomly sampled in a 5:1 ratio ( n = 105,080). RESULTS: During the 7 years of follow up, malignancy was detected in 763 (3.63%) systemic lupus erythematosus patients and 2667 (2.54%) controls. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients had a higher risk of malignancy than controls (odds ratio 1.44; 95% confidence interval 1.327-1.559), after multivariate adjustment. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients had a higher odds ratio for developing cervical, thyroid, ovarian, and oral cancer, as well as lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma than controls. Based on subgroup analysis, male systemic lupus erythematosus patients and patients younger than 40 years showed the highest lymphoma risk. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic lupus erythematosus might be an independent risk factor for cancer. Therefore, the importance of cancer screening programs should be emphasized in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Our study is the first large nationwide cohort study for evaluating the risk of cancer in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.","['Bae, E H', 'Lim, S Y', 'Han, K-D', 'Jung, J-Hy', 'Choi, H S', 'Kim, C S', 'Ma, S K', 'Kim, S W']","['Bae EH', 'Lim SY', 'Han KD', 'Jung JH', 'Choi HS', 'Kim CS', 'Ma SK', 'Kim SW']","['1 Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju.', '2 Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, Korea.', '3 Department of Medical Statistics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', '3 Department of Medical Statistics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', '1 Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju.', '1 Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju.', '1 Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju.', '1 Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190202,England,Lupus,Lupus,9204265,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0961203319826672 [doi]'],ppublish,Lupus. 2019 Mar;28(3):317-323. doi: 10.1177/0961203319826672.

However, the tumorigenicity, metastatic potential, gene expression profile and chromatin accessibility of acidosis-adapted colorectal cancer cells remain unknown. The colorectal cancer cell SW620 was cultured in acidic medium (pH 6.5) for more than 3 months to be acidosis-adapted (SW620-AA). In comparison to parental cells, SW620-AA cells exhibit enhanced tumorigenicity and liver metastatic potential in vivo. Following mRNA and lncRNA expression profiling, we validated that OLMF1, NFIB, SMAD9, DGKB are upregulated, while SESN2, MAP1B, UTRN, PCDH19, IL18, LMO2, CNKSR3, GXYLT2 are downregulated in SW620-AA cells. The differentially expressed mRNAs were significantly enriched in DNA remodeling-associated pathways including HDACs deacetylate histones, SIRT1 pathway, DNA methylation, DNA bending complex, and RNA polymerase 1 chain elongation. Finally, chromatin accessibility evaluation by ATAC-sequencing revealed that the differentially opened peaks were enriched in pathways such as small cell lung cancer, pathways in cancer, ErbB signaling, endometrial cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, which were mainly distributed in intergenic regions and introns. These results suggest that the chromatin accessibility changes are correlated with enhanced growth and liver metastasis capacity of acid-adapted colorectal cancer cells.","['Zhou, Zhi-Hang', 'Wang, Qing-Liang', 'Mao, Lin-Hong', 'Li, Xiao-Qin', 'Liu, Peng', 'Song, Jin-Wen', 'Liu, Xue', 'Xu, Feng', 'Lei, Jing', 'He, Song']","['Zhou ZH', 'Wang QL', 'Mao LH', 'Li XQ', 'Liu P', 'Song JW', 'Liu X', 'Xu F', 'Lei J', 'He S']","['a Department of Gastroenterology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'b Department of Pathology , the 309th hospital of PLA , Beijing , China.', 'c Department of Pathology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Department of Gastroenterology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Department of Gastroenterology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'd Department of Emergency , Chest Pain Center, General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command , Guangzhou , China.', 'e Treatment and Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The 302nd hosptital of PLA , Beijing , China.', 'f Department of Pathology , Basic Science School, Jining Medical University , Jining , Shandong , China.', 'a Department of Gastroenterology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Department of Gastroenterology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Department of Gastroenterology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190211,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC6422493,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2019.1578145 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2019 Feb;18(4):511-522. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2019.1578145.

METHODS: We used data from the Adelphi AML Disease Specific Programme, a real-world, cross-sectional survey conducted in 2015. Physicians completed patient record forms providing patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: In total, 61 academic, non-academic, and office-based hematologists and hematology/oncology specialists provided data on 457 patients with AML; 284 had >/=20% blasts (World Health Organization defined AML) and were included in the analysis. In the front-line setting, 60% of patients received high-intensity therapy, most commonly cytarabine plus anthracycline; the most common low-intensity treatments were hypomethylating agents. Primary drivers for selecting high-intensity versus low-intensity treatment were age, performance status and comorbidities; 67%, 64% and 61% of physicians stated they would prescribe high-intensity treatment to patients aged <65 years, with good performance status or no comorbidities, respectively. In practice, patients aged <60 years were more likely to receive high-intensity induction treatment (high vs. low intensity by age p < .0001). In a selected cohort of relapsed/refractory patients, 69% of patients received high-intensity therapy (78% of patients aged <60 years and 57% of patients aged >/=60 years). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in this analysis of real-world survey data received well established, front-line induction therapies. Treatment intensity was determined by age, comorbidities and performance status, as recommended by guidelines.","['Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Pandya, Bhavik J', 'Hadfield, Anna', 'Pike, James', 'Wilson, Samuel', 'Mueller, Cynthia', 'Bui, Cat N', 'Flanders, Scott C', 'Rider, Alex', 'Horvath Walsh, L Elise']","['Medeiros BC', 'Pandya BJ', 'Hadfield A', 'Pike J', 'Wilson S', 'Mueller C', 'Bui CN', 'Flanders SC', 'Rider A', 'Horvath Walsh LE']","['a Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stanford University , Stanford , CA , USA.', 'b Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Astellas Pharma, Inc. , Northbrook , IL , USA.', 'c Adelphi Real World, Adelphi Group , Cheshire , UK.', 'd Currently at Programme Excellence, Qiagen , Manchester , UK.', 'c Adelphi Real World, Adelphi Group , Cheshire , UK.', 'b Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Astellas Pharma, Inc. , Northbrook , IL , USA.', 'b Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Astellas Pharma, Inc. , Northbrook , IL , USA.', 'b Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Astellas Pharma, Inc. , Northbrook , IL , USA.', 'e Currently at Health Economics and Outcomes Research, AbbVie, Inc. , Mettawa , IL , USA.', 'b Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Astellas Pharma, Inc. , Northbrook , IL , USA.', 'f Currently at Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, LLC , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'c Adelphi Real World, Adelphi Group , Cheshire , UK.', 'b Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Astellas Pharma, Inc. , Northbrook , IL , USA.', 'g Currently at Medical Affairs, IQVIA Biotech , Columbus , OH , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190319,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,,,2019/02/05 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,['2019/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2019.1578152 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2019 May;35(5):927-935. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2019.1578152.

The multitissue DNA methylation (DNAm) age predictor combines the DNAm levels of 353 CpG dinucleotides to arrive at an age estimate referred to as DNAm age. Recent studies based on short-term observations showed that the DNAm age of reconstituted blood following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) reflects the age of the donor. However, it is not known whether the DNAm age of donor blood remains independent of the recipient's age over the long term. Importantly, long-term studies including child recipients have the potential to clearly reveal whether DNAm age is cell-intrinsic or whether it is modulated by extracellular cues in vivo. Here, we address this question by analyzing blood methylation data from HSCT donor and recipient pairs who greatly differed in chronological age (age differences between 1 and 49 years). We found that the DNAm age of the reconstituted blood was not influenced by the recipient's age, even 17 years after HSCT, in individuals without relapse of their hematologic disorder. However, the DNAm age of recipients with relapse of leukemia was unstable. These data are consistent with our previous findings concerning the abnormal DNAm age of cancer cells, and it can potentially be exploited to monitor the health of HSCT recipients. Our data demonstrate that transplanted human hematopoietic stem cells have an intrinsic DNAm age that is unaffected by the environment in a recipient of a different age.","['Soraas, Arne', 'Matsuyama, Mieko', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Wald, David', 'Buechner, Jochen', 'Gedde-Dahl, Tobias', 'Soraas, Camilla Lund', 'Chen, Brian', 'Ferrucci, Luigi', 'Dahl, John Arne', 'Horvath, Steve', 'Matsuyama, Shigemi']","['Soraas A', 'Matsuyama M', 'de Lima M', 'Wald D', 'Buechner J', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Soraas CL', 'Chen B', 'Ferrucci L', 'Dahl JA', 'Horvath S', 'Matsuyama S']","['Department of Microbiology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cardiology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'National Institute of Aging (NIA), National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'National Institute of Aging (NIA), National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Microbiology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190202,England,Aging Cell,Aging cell,101130839,PMC6413751,,2019/02/04 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/02/04 06:00'],"['2018/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/acel.12897 [doi]'],ppublish,Aging Cell. 2019 Apr;18(2):e12897. doi: 10.1111/acel.12897.

Survival of a population of quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSCs, also termed leukemia-initiating cells (LICs)) after treatment is one of the relapse reasons in Ph(+) ALL patient. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known as highly conserved 19-24 nucleotides non-protein-coding small RNAs that regulate the expression of human genes. miRNAs are often involved in the tuning of hematopoiesis. Therefore, the deregulation of miRNA expression and function in hematopoietic cells can cause cancer and promote its progression. This is the first comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression differences between CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs and CD34(+)CD38(+) leukemic progenitors (LPs) from the same Ph(+) B-ALL bone marrow samples using high-throughput sequencing technologies. We identified multiple differentially expressed miRNAs including hsa-miR-3143, hsa-miR-6503-3p, hsa-miR-744-3p, hsa-miR-1226-3p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, hsa-miR-4658 and hsa-miR-493-3p related to LSC and LP populations which have regulatory functions in stem-cell associated biological processes. The deregulation of these miRNAs could affect leukemogenesis, clonogenic and stemness capacities in these subpopulations of Ph(+) B-ALL. Therefore, identification of these LSC associated miRNAs may improve the diagnosis and management of B-ALL. These findings may also lead to future strategies to eliminate the presence of resistant LSCs, either by induction of apoptosis or by sensitizing these cells to chemotherapy.","['Valiollahi, Ehsan', 'Ribera, Josep Maria', 'Genesca, Eulalia', 'Behravan, Javad']","['Valiollahi E', 'Ribera JM', 'Genesca E', 'Behravan J']","['Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Josep Carreras Research Institute (IJC), ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Research Institute (IJC), ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain. egenesca@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. behravanj@mums.ac.ir.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Canada. behravanj@mums.ac.ir.', 'Theraphage Inc, Waterloo, ON, Canada. behravanj@mums.ac.ir.', 'Mediphage Bioceuticals, Inc, 661 University Avenue, Suite 1300, MaRS Centre, West Tower, Toronto, M5G0B7, Canada. behravanj@mums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190202,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,,,2019/02/04 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2019/02/04 06:00'],"['2018/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-019-04600-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-019-04600-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2019 Feb;46(1):1295-1306. doi: 10.1007/s11033-019-04600-5.

Treatment with ponatinib may suppress most of these mutants, including T315I, but is also associated with a high risk of clinically relevant side effects. We screened for alternative treatment options employing available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in combination. Dasatinib and bosutinib are two second-generation TKI that bind to different, albeit partially overlapping, spectra of kinase targets in CML cells. This observation prompted us to explore anti-leukemic effects of the combination dasatinib + bosutinib in highly resistant primary CML cells, various CML cell lines (K562, K562R, KU812, KCL22) and Ba/F3 cells harboring various BCR-ABL1 mutant-forms. We found that bosutinib synergizes with dasatinib in inducing growth inhibition and apoptosis in all CML cell lines and in Ba/F3 cells exhibiting BCR-ABL1(T315I). Clear synergistic effects were also observed in primary CML cells in all patients tested (n = 20), including drug-resistant cells carrying BCR-ABL1(T315I). Moreover, the drug combination produced cooperative or even synergistic apoptosis-inducing effects on CD34(+)/CD38(-) CML stem cells. Finally, we found that the drug combination is a potent approach to block the activity of major additional CML targets, including LYN, KIT and PDGFRalpha. Together, bosutinib and dasatinib synergize in producing anti-leukemic effects in drug-resistant CML cells. Whether such cooperative TKI effects also occur in vivo in patients with drug-resistant CML, remains to be determined in forthcoming studies.","['Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Sadovnik, Irina', 'Schneeweiss, Mathias', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Byrgazov, Konstantin', 'Stefanzl, Gabriele', 'Berger, Daniela', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Lion, Thomas', 'Valent, Peter']","['Gleixner KV', 'Sadovnik I', 'Schneeweiss M', 'Eisenwort G', 'Byrgazov K', 'Stefanzl G', 'Berger D', 'Herrmann H', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Lion T', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Department of Radiation Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Department/Clinic for Companion Animals and Horses, Clinic for Small Animals, Clinical Unit of Internal Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria.', ""Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria; Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

30711779,NLM,MEDLINE,20200702,1523-6536 (Electronic) 1083-8791 (Linking),25,7,2019 Jul,Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria in the Age of Eculizumab.,1331-1339,S1083-8791(19)30091-6 [pii] 10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.01.033 [doi],"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired clonal hematopoietic cell disease characterized by the destruction of hematopoietic cells through activation of the complement system with manifestations that can be life-threatening including hemolysis, thrombosis, and marrow failure. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the sole cure for PNH, but eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor of C5, has been used to prevent complement-mediated hemolysis in patients with PNH since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007. We examined outcomes of HCT in patients with PNH to evaluate the effects of disease subtype, conditioning intensity, and eculizumab use either pre-HCT or post-HCT. Fifty-five patients with a diagnosis of PNH underwent at least 1 HCT, with 4 patients requiring a second HCT for graft failure. The median age at the time of first HCT was 30.0 years (range, 4.2 to 66.9 years). Seventeen patients (30.9%) had classical PNH, and the remaining 38 patients had PNH associated with another marrow disorder (aplastic anemia in 26 of the 38). Indications for HCT included pancytopenia in 47.3% of the patients, myeloid malignancy (myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm, or acute myelogenous leukemia) in 21.8%, recurrent hemolysis in 20.0%, and thrombosis in 10.9%. Of the 55 first HCTs, 26 were performed with myeloablative conditioning, 27 were performed with reduced-intensity conditioning, and 2 sets of identical twins underwent HCT without any conditioning. Donor types included HLA-matched related in 38.2%, HLA-matched unrelated in 34.5%, single HLA-allele mismatched unrelated in 16.4%, umbilical cord blood in 5.5%, syngeneic in 3.6%, and HLA-haploidentical in 1.8%. The median duration of follow-up in surviving patients was 6.1 years (range, 2.1 to 46.1 years) after first HCT. The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 17 days and 19 days, respectively; all but 2 patients (96.3%) had sustained engraftment. Overall survival was 70% at 5 years. Neither the choice of conditioning intensity nor PNH subtype affected survival. Nineteen patients died during follow-up, including 12 patients before day +365. Six patients received treatment with eculizumab before HCT, and 2 were treated after HCT. All patients treated with eculizumab were alive at a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, .2 to 6.9 years). Both patients treated with eculizumab after HCT had minimal to no acute GVHD (aGVHD), with grade I skin aGVHD in 1 patient and no aGVHD in the other patient, and no chronic GVHD at 2.1 and 4.1 years post-HCT, respectively. With the approval of eculizumab, the indications for HCT include persistent hemolysis, persistent thrombosis, and associated marrow failure. Administration of eculizumab before and after HCT warrants further study, particularly considering our observation of minimal to no GVHD in 2 patients who received eculizumab after HCT.","['Cooper, Jason P', 'Farah, Rafic J', 'Stevenson, Philip A', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Scott, Bart L']","['Cooper JP', 'Farah RJ', 'Stevenson PA', 'Gooley TA', 'Storb R', 'Scott BL']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.

Although RANKL expression has been described in normal T cells, a potential role in T-cell leukemia remains undefined. Here, we used a model of immature T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, the TEL-JAK2 transgenic mice, to assess RANKL expression in leukemic cells and its regulatory mechanisms. We found that Rankl mRNA was significantly overexpressed in leukemic T cells when compared to wild-type thymocytes, their nonmalignant counterparts. Moreover, Rankl mRNA and RANKL surface expression in leukemic cells was induced by T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation, dependently on the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These results indicate that TCR-activated leukemic T cells express high levels of RANKL and are potential inducers of RANK signaling in microenvironmental cells.","['Fernandes, Monica T', 'Caroco, Lara S', 'Pacheco-Leyva, Ivette', 'Dos Santos, Nuno R']","['Fernandes MT', 'Caroco LS', 'Pacheco-Leyva I', 'Dos Santos NR']","['Centre for Biomedical Research (CBMR), University of Algarve, 8005-139, Faro, Portugal; PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Medicine, University of Algarve, 8005-139, Faro, Portugal.

NPM1 is an abundant multifunctional protein belonging to the nucleoplasmin family of nuclear chaperones. AML mutated protein is translocated into the cytoplasm (NPM1c+) retaining all functional domains except the loss of a unique NoLs (nucleolar localization signal) at the C-term domain (CTD) and the subsequent disruption of a three helix bundle as tertiary structure. The oligomeric state of NPM1 is of outmost importance for its biological roles and our previous studies linked an aggregation propensity of distinct regions of CTD to leukomogenic potentials of AML mutations. Here we investigated a polypeptide spanning the third and second helices of the bundle of type A mutated CTD. By a combination of several techniques, we ascertained the amyloid character of the aggregates and of fibrils resulting from a self-recognition mechanism.

This study explored miR-142-3p, which acts a critical role in sciatic nerve conditioning injury (SNCI) promoting the repair of the dorsal column injury and validated its function on primary sensory neuron(DRG). miR-142-3p expression increased greatly in the spinal cord dorsal column lesion (SDCL) group and increased slightly in the SNCI group. Subsequently, the expression of adenylate cyclase 9 (AC9), the target gene of miR-142-3p, declined sharply in the SDCL group and declined limitedly in the SNCI group. The expression trend of cAMP was opposite to that of miR-142-3p. MiR-142-3p inhibitor improved the axon length, upregulated the expression of AC9, cAMP, p-CREB, IL-6, and GAP43, and downregulated the expression of GTP-RhoA. miR-142-3p inhibitor combined with AC9 siRNA showed shorter axon length, the expression of AC9, cAMP, p-CREB, IL-6, and GAP43 was decreased, and the expression of GTP-RhoA was increased. H89 and AG490, inhibitors of cAMP/PKA pathway and IL6/STAT3/GAP43 axis, respectively, declined the enhanced axonal growth by miR-142-3p inhibitor and altered the expression level of the corresponding proteins. Thus, a substitution therapy using Sorafenib that downregulates the miR-142-3p expression for SNCI was investigated. The results showed the effect of Sorafenib was similar to that of miR-142-3p inhibitor and SNCI on both axon growth in vitro and sensory conduction function recovery in vivo. In conclusion, miR-142-3p acts a pivotal role in SNCI promoting the repair of dorsal column injury. Sorafenib mimics the treatment effect of SNCI via downregulation of miR-142-3p, subsequently, promoting sensory conduction function recovery post dorsal column injury.","['Wang, Tianyi', 'Li, Bo', 'Wang, Zhijie', 'Wang, Xin', 'Xia, Ziwei', 'Ning, Guangzhi', 'Wang, Xu', 'Zhang, Yanjun', 'Cui, Libin', 'Yu, Mei', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Yuan, Wenqi', 'Guo, Xiaoling', 'Yuan, Xin', 'Feng, Shiqing', 'Chen, Xueming']","['Wang T', 'Li B', 'Wang Z', 'Wang X', 'Xia Z', 'Ning G', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Cui L', 'Yu M', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang Z', 'Yuan W', 'Guo X', 'Yuan X', 'Feng S', 'Chen X']","[""Department of Orthopedics, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei Province, PR China."", 'Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, 067000, Hebei Province, PR China.', 'Chengde Medical University, Chengde, 067000, Hebei Province, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300211, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, PR China.', 'Department of Spine Surgery, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100000, PR China.', 'Department of Spine Surgery, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100000, PR China.', 'Leukemia Center, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Tianjin, 30020, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300211, PR China.', ""Department of Orthopedics, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei Province, PR China."", 'Department of Spinal Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750000, Ningxia, PR China.', ""Department of Neurology, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei Province, PR China.

Various heteroallelic GATA2 gene mutations are associated with a variety of hematological neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemias. Here, we report that impaired GATA2 expression induces myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasm development in elderly animals, and this neoplasm resembles chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in humans. GATA2 hypomorphic mutant (G2(f) (GN) (/) (fGN) ) mice that were generated by the germline insertion of a neocassette into the Gata2 gene locus avoided the early embryonic lethality observed in Gata2-null mice. However, adult G2(f) (GN) (/) (fGN) mice suffered from exacerbated leukocytosis concomitant with progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia and eventually developed massive granulomonocytosis accompanied by trilineage dysplasia. The reconstitution activity of G2(f) (GN) (/) (fGN) mouse stem cells was impaired. Furthermore, G2(f) (GN) (/) (fGN) progenitors showed myeloid lineage-biased proliferation and differentiation. Myeloid progenitor accumulation started at a younger age in G2(f) (GN) (/) (fGN) mice and appeared to worsen with age. G2(f) (GN) (/) (fGN) mice showed increased expression of transcripts encoding cytokine receptors, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor and interleukin-6 receptor, in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. This increased expression could be correlated with the hypersensitive granulomonocytic proliferation reaction when the mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide. Taken together, these observations indicate that GATA2 hypomorphism leads to a hyperreactive defense response to infections, and this reaction is attributed to a unique intrinsic cell defect in the regulation of myeloid expansion that increases the risk of hematological neoplasm transformation.","['Harada, Nobuhiko', 'Hasegawa, Atsushi', 'Hirano, Ikuo', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Shimizu, Ritsuko']","['Harada N', 'Hasegawa A', 'Hirano I', 'Yamamoto M', 'Shimizu R']","['Department of Molecular Hematology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Hematology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Hematology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Hematology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190223,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC6447832,,2019/02/03 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2019/02/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13959 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Apr;110(4):1183-1193. doi: 10.1111/cas.13959.

Traditionally, receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptor are regarded as its principle upstream regulators; however, recent reports have indicated that spleen tyrosine kinase, beta-arrestin2, Janus kinase, and RAS can also perform this role. Dysregulation of PI3K is common in the progression of various diseases, including, but not limited to, tumors, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute myelogenous leukemia.

To determine whether this alteration also affects outcomes after haploidentical donor (HID) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), we compared 334 consecutive FLT3-ITD-positive vs -negative patients with AML (other than acute promyelocytic leukemia) who underwent HID-HSCT. FLT3-ITD was detected in 39 of 334 patients (11.7%). The 2-year relapse rates for FLT3-ITD-positive and -negative patients were 16% and 17%, respectively (P = 0.774). The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for FLT3-ITD-positive and -negative patients were 74% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64-81) and 73% (95% CI: 70-81), respectively; P = 0.872); while the 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 72% (95% CI: 67-81) and 77% (95% CI: 72-84), respectively (P = 0.862). FLT3-ITD mutation had no influence on non-relapse mortality (NRM 15% vs 14%, P = 0.463). Multivariate analyses showed that disease status at HSCT and white blood cell count at diagnosis were independent risk factors associated with relapse, DFS, and OS. In conclusion, FLT3 mutation status has no impact on outcomes after HID-HSCT in patients with AML. HID-HSCT is therefore a valid option for AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation.","['Zhang, Yuan-Yuan', 'Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Wang, Yu', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Sun, Yu-Qian', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Zhang YY', 'Mo XD', 'Zhang XH', 'Xu LP', 'Wang Y', 'Yan CH', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Han W', 'Wang FR', 'Wang JZ', 'Sun YQ', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, P.R.

Using a high-throughput sequencing platform, we sought to analyze the TCR gamma-chain (TRG) repertoire of gammadelta T cells within donor stem cell grafts and address its potential impact on clinical response in the corresponding patients. A total of 20 peripheral blood stem cell grafts were analyzed, and donors were classified as CMV(+/-) The respective acute myeloid leukemia recipients were followed for disease relapse and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) development post-HSCT. In all samples, TRG repertoire showed a reduced diversity and displayed overrepresented clones. This was more prominent in grafts from CMV(+) donors, which presented a more private repertoire, lower diversity, skewed distribution, and reduced usage of the V9-JP pairing. Grafts given to nonrelapse patients presented a more public repertoire and increased presence of long sequence clonotypes. Variable-joining gene segment usage was not associated with aGvHD development, but a higher usage of V2-JP1 pairing and lower usage of V4-J2/V5-J2/V8-JP2 were observed in grafts given to nonrelapse patients. Our work identified five private overrepresented and one public CDR3 sequence (CATWDGPYYKKLF) associated with CMV infection, in addition to 12 highly frequent public sequences present exclusively in grafts given to nonrelapse patients. Our findings show that, despite CMV infection reshaping the TRG repertoire, TRG composition is not associated with aGvHD development, and several public sequences are associated with clinical remission.","['Arruda, Lucas C M', 'Gaballa, Ahmed', 'Uhlin, Michael']","['Arruda LCM', 'Gaballa A', 'Uhlin M']","['Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm 141 86, Sweden; lucas.arruda@ki.se.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm 141 86, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm 141 86, Sweden.', 'Department of Applied Physics, Science for Life Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm 141 86, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm 141 86, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190201,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,,2019/02/03 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2019/02/03 06:00'],"['2018/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801448 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801448 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Mar 15;202(6):1859-1870. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801448.

TLRs, particularly TLR4, and its downstream-signaling MyD88 pathway play an important role in regulating myeloid-mediated inflammation. Because an initial inflammatory phase is vital for tissue repair, we investigated the role of TLR4-regulated, myeloid-mediated inflammation in wound healing. In a cutaneous tissue injury murine model, we found that TLR4 expression is dynamic in wound myeloid cells during the course of normal wound healing. We identified that changes in myeloid TLR4 during tissue repair correlated with increased expression of the histone methyltransferase, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), which specifically trimethylates the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) position of the TLR4 promoter. Furthermore, we used a myeloid-specific Mll1 knockout (Mll1(f/f)Lyz2(Cre+) ) to determine MLL1 drives Tlr4 expression during wound healing. To understand the critical role of myeloid-specific TLR4 signaling, we used mice deficient in Tlr4 (Tlr4(-/-) ), Myd88 (Myd88 (-/-)), and myeloid-specific Tlr4 (Tlr4(f/f)Lyz2(Cre+)) to demonstrate delayed wound healing at early time points postinjury. Furthermore, in vivo wound myeloid cells isolated from Tlr4(-/-) and Myd88 (-/-) wounds demonstrated decreased inflammatory cytokine production. Importantly, adoptive transfer of monocyte/macrophages from wild-type mice trafficked to wounds with restoration of normal healing and myeloid cell function in Tlr4-deficient mice. These results define a role for myeloid-specific, MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling in the inflammatory response following cutaneous tissue injury and suggest that MLL1 regulates TLR4 expression in wound myeloid cells.","['Davis, Frank M', 'Kimball, Andrew', 'denDekker, Aaron', 'Joshi, Amrita D', 'Boniakowski, Anna E', 'Nysz, Dylan', 'Allen, Ronald M', 'Obi, Andrea', 'Singer, Kanakadurga', 'Henke, Peter K', 'Moore, Bethany B', 'Kunkel, Steven L', 'Gallagher, Katherine A']","['Davis FM', 'Kimball A', 'denDekker A', 'Joshi AD', 'Boniakowski AE', 'Nysz D', 'Allen RM', 'Obi A', 'Singer K', 'Henke PK', 'Moore BB', 'Kunkel SL', 'Gallagher KA']","['Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; kgallag@med.umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190201,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC6401313,,2019/02/03 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2019/02/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801258 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801258 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Mar 15;202(6):1777-1785. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801258.

This is challenging because by the time patients are diagnosed with cancer, early events of tumorigenesis have already taken place. Similarly, development of cancer immunotherapies is hampered by a lack of appropriate small animal models with autologous human tumor and immune system. In this article, we report the development of a mouse model of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with autologous immune system for studying early events of human leukemogenesis and testing the efficacy of immunotherapeutics. To develop such a model, human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) are transduced with lentiviruses expressing a mutated form of nucleophosmin (NPM1), referred to as NPM1c. Following engraftment into immunodeficient mice, transduced HSPCs give rise to human myeloid leukemia, whereas untransduced HSPCs give rise to human immune cells in the same mice. The de novo AML, with CD123(+) leukemic stem or initiating cells (LSC), resembles NPM1c(+) AML from patients. Transcriptional analysis of LSC and leukemic cells confirms similarity of the de novo leukemia generated in mice with patient leukemia and suggests Myc as a co-operating factor in NPM1c-driven leukemogenesis. We show that a bispecific conjugate that binds both CD3 and CD123 eliminates CD123(+) LSCs in a T cell-dependent manner both in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrate the utility of the NPM1c(+) AML model with an autologous immune system for studying early events of human leukemogenesis and for evaluating efficacy and mechanism of immunotherapeutics.","['Kaur, Mandeep', 'Drake, Adam C', 'Hu, Guangan', 'Rudnick, Stephen', 'Chen, Qingfeng', 'Phennicie, Ryan', 'Attar, Ricardo', 'Nemeth, Jeffrey', 'Gaudet, Francois', 'Chen, Jianzhu']","['Kaur M', 'Drake AC', 'Hu G', 'Rudnick S', 'Chen Q', 'Phennicie R', 'Attar R', 'Nemeth J', 'Gaudet F', 'Chen J']","['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Springhouse, PA 19477; and.', 'Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore 138673.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Springhouse, PA 19477; and.', 'Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Springhouse, PA 19477; and.', 'Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Springhouse, PA 19477; and.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139; jchen@mit.edu.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190201,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC6401260,,2019/02/03 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2019/02/03 06:00'],"['2018/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800366 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800366 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Mar 15;202(6):1885-1894. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800366.

Immunotherapy targeting inhibitory pathways to unleash the antileukemia T-cell response is a promising strategy for the treatment of leukemia, but we must first understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Eomesodermin (Eomes) and T-bet are both T-box transcription factors that regulate CD8(+) T-cell responses in a context-specific manner. Here, we examined the role of these transcription factors in CD8(+) T-cell immunity in AML patients. We report that the frequency of Eomes(+)T-bet(low) CD8(+) T cells increased in newly diagnosed AML. This cell subset produced fewer cytokines and displayed reduced killing capacity, whereas depletion of Eomes by siRNA reversed these functional defects. Furthermore, Eomes bound the promoter of T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and positively regulated the expression of this inhibitory receptor on patient-derived T cells. A high frequency of Eomes(+)T-bet(low) CD8(+) T cells was associated with poor response to induction chemotherapy and shorter overall survival in AML patients. These findings have significant clinical implications as they not only identify a predictive and prognostic biomarker for AML, but they also provide an important target for effective leukemia therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal that a high frequency of Eomes(+)T-bet(low) CD8(+) T cells predicts poor clinical outcome in AML and that targeting Eomes may provide a therapeutic benefit against AML.","['Jia, Bei', 'Zhao, Chenchen', 'Rakszawski, Kevin L', 'Claxton, David F', 'Ehmann, W Christopher', 'Rybka, Witold B', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Wang, Ming', 'Shike, Hiroko', 'Bayerl, Michael G', 'Sivik, Jeffrey M', 'Schell, Todd D', 'Drabick, Joseph J', 'Hohl, Raymond J', 'Zheng, Hong']","['Jia B', 'Zhao C', 'Rakszawski KL', 'Claxton DF', 'Ehmann WC', 'Rybka WB', 'Mineishi S', 'Wang M', 'Shike H', 'Bayerl MG', 'Sivik JM', 'Schell TD', 'Drabick JJ', 'Hohl RJ', 'Zheng H']","['Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Health Milton S.

TET2 (MT) includes mostly loss-of-function/hypomorphic hits. Impaired TET2 activity skews differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells toward proliferating myeloid precursors. This study was prompted by the observation of frequent biallelic TET2 gene inactivations (biTET2 (i) ) in CMML. We speculated that biTET2 (i) might be associated with distinct clinicohematological features. We analyzed TET2 (MT) in 1045 patients with MN. Of 82 biTET2 (i) cases, 66 were biTET2 (MT), 13 were hemizygous TET2 (MT), and 3 were homozygous TET2 (MT) (uniparental disomy); the remaining patients (denoted biTET2 (-) hereafter) were either monoallelic TET2 (MT) (n = 96) or wild-type TET2 (n = 823). Truncation mutations were found in 83% of biTET2 (i) vs 65% of biTET2 (-) cases (P = .02). TET2 hits were founder lesions in 72% of biTET2 (i) vs 38% of biTET2 (-) cases (P < .0001). In biTET2 (i) , significantly concurrent hits included SRSF2 (MT) (33%; P < .0001) and KRAS/NRAS (MT) (16%; P = .03) as compared with biTET2 (-) When the first TET2 hit was ancestral in biTET2 (i) , the most common subsequent hits affected a second TET2 (MT), followed by SRSF2 (MT), ASXL1 (MT), RAS (MT), and DNMT3A (MT) BiTET2 (i) patients without any monocytosis showed an absence of SRSF2 (MT) BiTET2 (i) patients were older and had monocytosis, CMML, normal karyotypes, and lower-risk disease compared with biTET2 (-) patients. Hence, while a second TET2 hit occurred frequently, biTET2 (i) did not portend faster progression but rather determined monocytic differentiation, consistent with its prevalence in CMML. Additionally, biTET2 (i) showed lower odds of cytopenias and marrow blasts (>/=5%) and higher odds of myeloid dysplasia and marrow hypercellularity.

In both models, RUNX1mut overexpression strongly impaired myeloid commitment. Instead, self-renewal was enhanced, as shown, by increased long-term culture-initiating cell frequencies and enhanced colony-forming cell replating capacity. Long-term suspension cultures with RUNX1mut-transduced cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells continued for more than 100 days, during which the cells displayed an immature granulocyte-macrophage progenitor-like CD34(+)/CD123(+)/CD45RA(+) phenotype. The CD34(+)/CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population most likely acted as cell of origin, as HSCs provided the best long-term proliferative potential on overexpression of RUNX1mut. CEBPA expression was reduced in RUNX1mut cells, and reexpression of CEBPA partly restored differentiation. RNA-seq analysis on CB/iPSC systems and on primary patient samples confirmed that RUNX1 mutations induce a myeloid differentiation block, and that a common set of RUNX1mut-upregulated target genes was strongly enriched for gene ontology terms associated with nucleosome assembly and chromatin structure. Interestingly, in comparison with AML1-ETO binding in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), we found significantly distinct genomic distribution and differential expression for RUNX1mut of genes such as TCF4, MEIS1, and HMGA2 that may potentially contribute to the underlying difference in clinical outcomes between RUNX1mut and AML1-ETO patients. In conclusion, RUNX1mut appears to induce a specific transcriptional program that contributes to leukemic transformation.","['Gerritsen, Mylene', 'Yi, Guoqiang', 'Tijchon, Esther', 'Kuster, Jorren', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Martens, Joost H A', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Gerritsen M', 'Yi G', 'Tijchon E', 'Kuster J', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Martens JHA', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen Cancer Research Centre, Groningen, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen Cancer Research Centre, Groningen, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen Cancer Research Centre, Groningen, The Netherlands; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6373749,,2019/02/03 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/02/03 06:00'],"['2018/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018024422 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024422 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Feb 12;3(3):320-332. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024422.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1464-9535', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8452-8555']",,,20200203,IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/biosynthesis/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Protein Binding']","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell therapies targeting common shared antigens for epithelial cancers are not yet broadly available. Here, we report the identification and characterization in one patient of T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognizing mutated p53 p.R175H, which is shared among a subset of patients with cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were screened for recognition of mutated neoantigens in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer. HLA-A*0201-restricted recognition of mutated p53 p.R175H was identified, and the minimal peptide epitope was HMTEVVRHC. Reactive T cells were isolated by tetramer sorting, and three TCRs were identified. These TCRs mediated recognition of commercially available ovarian cancer, uterine carcinoma, and myeloma cell lines, as well as an NIH patient-derived esophageal adenocarcinoma line that endogenously expressed p53 p.R175H and HLA-A*0201. They also mediated recognition of p53 p.R175H(+) colon, breast, and leukemia cell lines after transduction with a retrovirus encoding HLA-A*0201. This work demonstrates that common shared mutated epitopes such as those found in p53 can elicit immunogenic responses and that the application of ACT may be extended to patients with any cancer histology that expresses both HLA-A*0201 and the p53 p.R175H mutation.","['Lo, Winifred', 'Parkhurst, Maria', 'Robbins, Paul F', 'Tran, Eric', 'Lu, Yong-Chen', 'Jia, Li', 'Gartner, Jared J', 'Pasetto, Anna', 'Deniger, Drew', 'Malekzadeh, Parisa', 'Shelton, Thomas E', 'Prickett, Todd', 'Ray, Satyajit', 'Kivitz, Scott', 'Paria, Biman C', 'Kriley, Isaac', 'Schrump, David S', 'Rosenberg, Steven A']","['Lo W', 'Parkhurst M', 'Robbins PF', 'Tran E', 'Lu YC', 'Jia L', 'Gartner JJ', 'Pasetto A', 'Deniger D', 'Malekzadeh P', 'Shelton TE', 'Prickett T', 'Ray S', 'Kivitz S', 'Paria BC', 'Kriley I', 'Schrump DS', 'Rosenberg SA']","['Thoracic and Gastrointestinal Oncology Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Surgery Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Surgery Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.

Historically, the use of RWE has been approached with skepticism because of its often-retrospective nature compared with data from conventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This review discusses the role and function of RWE and RWD in clinical research. We summarize the types of RWE used in clinical research, outline the challenges and limitations involved with these data, and suggest how these types of analyses can supplement results from clinical trials to foster a more complete understanding of a drug or disease area of interest. In particular, we focus on the role of RWE in investigating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for CML. METHODS: We reviewed FDA guidance on the use of RWE and conducted a PubMed literature search to evaluate published data from real-world studies in CML. FINDINGS: RWE includes analysis of RWD gathered from nonconventional sources, including patient registries, observational studies, and social media, among others. Importantly, although real-world studies do not adhere to the same degree of controlled conditions and predefined patient-management strategies as do conventional clinical trials, analyses resulting from these studies can be held to a high degree of validation and standardization, making them as meaningful as those from RCTs. In CML, RWE has informed early treatment milestones and has provided a window into patient perspectives regarding treatment. These types of analyses have already informed and can continue to inform disease management. These improvements in disease management, in turn, will help clinicians to better forecast treatment challenges and allow for the optimization of future treatment paradigms. IMPLICATIONS: Real-world studies are different from conventional RCTs and therefore provide insight into distinct aspects of treatment and patient outcomes. Together with results from clinical trials, RWE can help to illustrate a more complete picture of the tolerability, effectiveness, and impact of a drug. The recently published guidelines indicate that the FDA expects a growing role for RWE.","['Webster, Jonathan', 'Smith, B Douglas']","['Webster J', 'Smith BD']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.

The aim of an extended follow-up study was the assessment of long-term outcomes, which are, in this context, scarcely reported in the literature. We report unpublished data on quality of life (QoL) from the original study and the results of a follow-up extension. METHODS: In the original open-label study, patients with acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia in first or subsequent remission, having sibling HLA-identical allogeneic peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ATLG plus standard GVHD prophylaxis with ciclosporin and short-term methotrexate (ATLG group) or standard GVHD prophylaxis without ATLG (non-ATLG group). Conditioning regimens were cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg with either total body irradiation (12 Gy) or busulfan (12.8 mg/kg intravenously or 16 mg/kg orally), with or without etoposide (30-60 mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified according to centre and disease risk. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 2 years. The primary and secondary endpoints, excluding QoL, have been published. QoL, assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HDC29 questionnaires, was an unpublished secondary endpoint, which we now report here. A follow-up extension was then done, with the primary endpoint cumulative incidence of cGVHD. Enrolment has been completed for both studies. The original trial (number, NCT00678275) and follow-up extension (number, NCT03042676) are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. FINDINGS: In the original study, from Dec 14, 2006, to Feb 2, 2012, 161 patients were enrolled and 155 were randomly assigned to either the ATLG group (n=83) or to the non-ATLG group (n=72). In the follow-up study, which started on Feb 7, 2017, and was completed on June 30, 2017, 61 patients were included in the ATLG group and 53 were included in the non-ATLG group. Global health status showed a more favourable time course in the ATLG group compared with the non-ATLG group (p=0.02; treatment by visit interaction). ATLG was descriptively superior to non-ATLG at 24 months for physical function (points estimate -14.8 [95% CI -26.4 to -3.1]; p=0.014) and social function (-19.1 [-38.0 to -0.2]; p=0.047), gastrointestinal side-effects (8.8 [2.5-15.1]; p=0.008) and effect on family (13.5 [1.2-25.8]; p=0.032). Extended follow-up (median 5.9 years [IQR 1.7-7.9]) confirmed a lower 5-year cGVHD incidence (30.0% [95% CI 21.4-41.9] vs 69.1% [59.1-80.1]; analysis for entire follow-up, p<0.001), no increase in relapses (35.4% [26.4-47.5] vs 22.5% [14.6-34.7]; p=0.09), improved cGRFS (34.3% [24.2-44.5] vs 13.9% [7.1-22.9]; p=0.005), and fewer patients still in immunosuppression (9.6% vs 28.3%; p=0.017) in the ATLG group compared with the non-ATLG group. 5-year overall survival, relapse-free survival, and non-relapse mortality did not differ significantly between groups. INTERPRETATION: The addition of ATLG to standard GVHD prophylaxis improves the probability of surviving without disease relapse and cGVHD after myeloablative peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor for patients with acute leukaemia in remission. Further additional benefits are better QoL and shorter immunosuppressive treatment compared with standard GVHD prophylaxis without ATLG. Therefore, in this setting, ATLG plus standard GVHD prophylaxis should be preferred over the standard GVHD prophylaxis alone.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of the triplet ublituximab, umbralisib, and ibrutinib in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies. METHODS: We did an open-label, phase 1 study with dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases, at five centres in the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed lymphocytic leukaemia or relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, had measurable disease, adequate organ function, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less. Patients with known CNS lymphoma, active hepatitis B or C infection, or HIV were excluded. In the dose-escalation cohort, patients were treated in cycles of 28 days with escalating doses of oral umbralisib (400, 600, or 800 mg) and fixed doses of intravenous ublituximab (900 mg) and oral ibrutinib (420 mg for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; 560 mg for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma) in a standard 3 x 3 design until disease progression or intolerance. In the dose-expansion phase, patients were given the recommended dose of the drug combination as determined from the dose-escalation phase. The primary endpoints were safety, dose-limiting toxicities, and the maximum tolerated dose of umbralisib, when given in combination with ublituximab and ibrutinib. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug; activity was assessed in all patients who had at least one post-treatment efficacy measurement. The study is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02006485. FINDINGS: Between Sept 2, 2014, and Nov 6, 2017, we enrolled 46 patients: 24 in the dose-escalation cohort (n=14 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma; n=10 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and 22 in the dose-expansion cohort (n=9 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma; n=13 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma). 46 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The maximum tolerated dose of umbralisib was not reached. The recommended dose for the dose-expansion phase was umbralisib 800 mg orally once daily plus ibrutinib orally once daily and intravenous ublituximab 900 mg administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, day 1 of cycles 2-6, and on day 1 of cycles 9 and 12. 37 (84%) of 44 patients achieved an overall response (complete or partial response). The most common any-grade adverse events were diarrhoea (n=27 [59%]), fatigue (n=23 [50%]), infusion-related reaction (n=20 [43%]), dizziness (n=17 [37%]), nausea (n=17 [37%]), and cough (n=16 [35%]). Grade 3-4 adverse events were manageable with the most common being neutropenia (n=10 [22%]) and cellulitis (n=6 [13%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (24%) of 46 patients and included rash (n=2 [4%]), pneumonia (n=2 [4%]), atrial fibrillation (n=2 [4%]), sepsis (n=2 [4%]), abdominal pain (n=1 [2%]), syncope (n=1 [2%]), cellulitis (n=1 [2%]), pneumonitis (n=1 [2%]), headache (n=1 [2%]), lung infection (n=1 [2%]), skin infection (n=1 [2%]), pleural effusion (n=1 [2%]), pericardial infusion (n=1 [2%]), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n=1 [2%]), diarrhoea (n=1 [2%]), and weakness (n=1 [2%]). No deaths related to adverse events occurred. INTERPRETATION: The combination of ublituximab, umbralisib, and ibrutinib seems to be tolerable and is associated with encouraging activity in advanced chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This triplet combination will require further investigation in future studies to improve understanding of this novel, chemotherapy-free triplet combination in the management of these cancers.

Cancer mortality was based on deaths with cause of deaths associated with malignant cancers filed with the Rhode Island Vital Records and CDC National Center for Health Statistics. We found that pediatric cancer is increasing in Rhode Island. Between 1995-2015, there were 1,090 new diagnoses of childhood cancer. Leukemia, tumors of the central nervous system, and lymphomas are the most common types of cancer in children in the state. Additionally, the overall mortality rate from childhood cancer is decreasing. In conclusion, the childhood cancer trends in Rhode Island are consistent with the national data.

Previous studies have shown that Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells could expand in the presence of phosphoantigens and IL-2 and exert antitumor functions. However, their potency was limited because sustained proliferation could not be achieved, possibly due to exhaustion caused by prolonged antigenic stimulation. In this study, we examined the proliferative response of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells to IL-21, a cytokine previously shown to promote NK cell and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity. We found that IL-21 could significantly improve the proliferation of phosphoantigen-stimulated Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the efficacy of IL-21 was significantly reduced. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells from AML patients exhibited lower expression of IL-21R, and required higher levels of IL-21 for expansion. IL-21-treated Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells from AML patients presented lower increase in STAT1 phosphorylation than Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells from healthy volunteers. Interestingly, AML Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells presented significantly higher Tim-3 expression than healthy Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. IL-21 treatment further induced Tim-3 upregulation. Blocking Tim-3 increased the proliferation and the STAT phosphorylation in Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells in response to IL-21. Together, these results demonstrated that IL-21 could significantly expand the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, but its efficacy was limited since it also increased the expression of checkpoint molecule Tim-3.","['Wu, Kangni', 'Zhao, Haijun', 'Xiu, Yanghui', 'Li, Zhifeng', 'Zhao, Jintao', 'Xie, Shiting', 'Zeng, Hanyan', 'Zhang, Haiping', 'Yu, Lian', 'Xu, Bing']","['Wu K', 'Zhao H', 'Xiu Y', 'Li Z', 'Zhao J', 'Xie S', 'Zeng H', 'Zhang H', 'Yu L', 'Xu B']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, P.R.

When choosing the best donor for HLA haploidentical transplantations, most institutions prioritize using young male donors over mother donors. In a retrospective study we compared outcomes in mother donor and URD transplantations. We found that both 2-year overall survival and 2-year leukemia-free survival were comparable between the mother donor group and URD group (74.8% versus 72.9%, P=.937, and 71.7% versus 67.0%, P=.580, respectively). Higher incidences of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were observed in the mother donor group than in the URD group (43.5% versus 14.0%, P=.001, and 62.2% versus 38.7%, P=.007, respectively). The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse were significantly decreased in the mother donor group (7.6% versus 20.9%, P=.036). These findings suggest mother donor transplantations could achieve comparable survival with URD transplantations and exhibited decreased rates of relapse but increased rates of GVHD, indicating that mother donors would be a suitable choice for patients without an identical sibling donor.","['Ma, Rui', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yao', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Wang, Yu']","['Ma R', 'Huang XJ', 'Xu LP', 'Liu KY', 'Zhang XH', 'Yan CH', 'Han W', 'Wang FR', 'Chen YH', 'Chen H', 'Chen Y', 'Wang JZ', 'Wang Y']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) is the sole curative treatment but is associated with significant morbidity. The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab reduces hemolysis and thromboembolic events and is the sole Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for PNH. Prophylactic administration of this agent in the early post-transplantation setting to prevent hemolysis and thrombosis has not been described in the literature. We describe our institutional experience of 8 patients with PNH who underwent alloHCT and who received at least 1 dose of eculizumab within 30 days of alloHCT for prevention of thrombosis and hemolysis. One patient with underlying aplastic anemia who received bone marrow stem cells failed to engraft. Another patient experienced steroid-refractory grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease and died of a fungal infection.

The present study was to investigate the in vitro activity of honokiol against A549 and 95-D human lung cancer cells. MAIN METHODS: A549 and 95-D cells were used with honokiol treatment. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. The cell migration and apoptosis were evaluated by wound healing assay and TUNEL staining method respectively. The expressions of ER-related proteins were analyzed by western blot and the CHOP siRNA was used to downregulate the CHOP expression. KEY FINDINGS: The results demonstrated that treatment of A549 and 95-D cells with honokiol significantly reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, honokiol treatment decreased cell migration and enhanced cell apoptosis, which is accompanied by the upregulation of the expressions of ER stress-induced apoptotic signaling molecules such as GRP78, phosphorylated PERK, phosphorylated eIF2alpha, CHOP, Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved Caspase 9. Honokiol treatment-induced increase of ER stress-related signaling molecules and apoptotic proteins in A549 and 95-D cells were reversed by CHOP siRNA. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, we conclude that ER stress may participate in the action of the anticancer activity of honokiol in A549 and 95-D cells and induction of ER stress-related apoptosis may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for human lung cancer.","['Zhu, Jianfei', 'Xu, Shuonan', 'Gao, Wenli', 'Feng, Jianyu', 'Zhao, Guolong']","['Zhu J', 'Xu S', 'Gao W', 'Feng J', 'Zhao G']","[""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Xi'an 710068, China; The Third Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710068, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Xi'an 710068, China; The Third Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710068, China; The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an 710077, China."", ""Department of Gynaecology, The Northwest Women and Children Hospital, Xi'an 710061, China."", ""Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xijing Hospital of The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Xi'an 710068, China; The Third Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710068, China; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The Northwest Women and Children Hospital, Xi'an 710061, China.

METHODS: Eligibility for this cross-sectional study of AYA cancer survivors included the diagnosis of a malignancy between ages 18 and 39 years and survey completion within 1 to 5 years from diagnosis and >/=1 year after therapy completion. Participants were selected randomly from the tumor registries of 7 participating sites and completed an online patient-reported outcomes survey to assess employment and financial concerns. Treatment data were abstracted from medical records. Data were analyzed across diagnoses and by tumor site using logistic regression and Wald-based 95% confidence intervals adjusting for age (categorized), sex, insurance status, education (categorized), and treatment exposures. RESULTS: Participants included 872 survivors (breast cancer, n = 241; thyroid cancer, n = 126; leukemia/lymphoma, n = 163; other malignancies, n = 342). Exposure to chemotherapy in breast cancer survivors was associated with an increase in self-reported mental impairment in work tasks (odds ratio [OR], 2.66) and taking unpaid time off (OR, 2.62); survivors of ""other"" malignancies reported an increase in mental impairment of work tasks (OR, 3.67) and borrowing >$10,000 (OR, 3.43).

Complete cytogenetic and major molecular remissions were not affected, whereas the achievement of both a DMR (P = .008) and an sDMR (P = .004) was favored significantly in patients who had the e14a2 transcript. After a median of 68 months, the sDMR rate was 39.6% in those with the e14a2 transcript and 19.4% in those with the e13a2 transcript. In addition to transcript type, both the early achievement of a molecular response and starting treatment with a second-generation TKI positively affected the attainment of an sDMR in multivariate analysis. The use of a second-generation TKI as frontline treatment increased the sDMR rate in both transcript types. However, in patients who had the e13a2 transcript, the probability of attaining an sDMR was 37% after 60 months and did not increase further despite continuing therapy. Among 51 of 60 patients who attained an sDMR after discontinuing TKIs, 24 experienced a molecular relapse, but all regained molecular remission after resuming TKI treatment. Again, transcript type influenced TFR maintenance (P = .005), because only 2 patients (3%) with the e13a2 transcript enjoyed a durable TFR compared with 25 (23.5%) of those with the e14a2 transcript. CONCLUSIONS: The e13a2 transcript hinders the achievement of deep responses and the possibility of stopping TKI treatment in patients with CML.","[""D'Adda, Mariella"", 'Farina, Mirko', 'Schieppati, Francesca', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Bottelli, Chiara', 'Cerqui, Elisa', 'Ferrari, Samantha', 'Gramegna, Doriana', 'Pagani, Chiara', 'Passi, Angela', 'Maifredi, Adriana', 'Tucci, Alessandra', 'Capucci, Maria A', 'Ruggeri, Giuseppina', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","[""D'Adda M"", 'Farina M', 'Schieppati F', 'Borlenghi E', 'Bottelli C', 'Cerqui E', 'Ferrari S', 'Gramegna D', 'Pagani C', 'Passi A', 'Maifredi A', 'Tucci A', 'Capucci MA', 'Ruggeri G', 'Rossi G']","['Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine Service, ASST Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Laboratory Analysis, ASST Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Local Social Health Authority (ASST) Spedali Civili Brescia, Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190201,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,,2019/02/02 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31977 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 May 15;125(10):1674-1682. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31977.

This study aims to explore the unknown function of lncRNA LINC00152 in the leukemogenesis of AML. LINC00152 is determined to be upregulated in the AML samples, and the overexpression of LINC00152 is also authenticated in the advanced French-American-British (FAB) AML patients and closely correlated with the poor outcome of AML patients. The functional experiments state that knockdown of LINC00152 suppresses the proliferation, accelerates the apoptosis, and induces the cycle arrest of AML cells. The mechanical experiments state that LINC00152 and CDK9 were both targeted by miR-193a with the complementary binding sites at 3'-UTR. Moreover, in the rescue experiments, the enhanced LINC00152 expression could regain the suppression of tumor behavior induced by LINC00152 knockdown. In conclusion, this research reveals the important role of lncRNA LINC00152 in the AML leukemogenesis through targeting miR-193a/CDK9 axis. This finding could indicate the important pathogenesis of ncRNA and the vital roles of epigenetic regulation.","['Zhang, Xingxia', 'Tao, Weiguo']","['Zhang X', 'Tao W']","[""1 Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huai'an Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Huai'an, China."", '2 General Practice Department, The First Hospital of Jiaxing, Jiaxing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190201,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/03/16 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2018.4482 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2019 Mar;38(3):236-242. doi: 10.1089/dna.2018.4482.

Tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide (As4 S4 ), a traditional Chinese medicine, is effective on acute promyelocytic leukemia with mild side effects. In our previous study, BXSB lupus-prone mice treated with As4 S4 has showed improved monocytosis, decreased serum interleukin (IL)-6 and suppressed skin, liver and renal lesions with well-tolerance. In this study, we explored the effect and mechanism of As4 S4 on the MRL/lpr mice. MRL/lpr and wild MRL/MpJ mice were divided into control and As4 S4 treatment groups and dosed with As4 S4 or placebo for 8 weeks. We found that As4 S4 prevented the skin, renal and lung lesions of MRL/lpr mice. As4 S4 significantly decreased the double negative T (DN T) cells and reduced the serum levels of IL-17, IL-10, and antinuclear antibodies titer. Further results revealed that the FasL was decreased, and activated caspases elevated in DN T cells in As4 S4 treated MRL/lpr mice. Taken together, As4 S4 could selectively suppresses DN T cells by inducing apoptosis. It also reduced inflammatory cytokines IL-17, which may be produced by DN T cells.

Human genetic studies have discovered germline mutations in single genes that instigate familial MDS/AML. The best understood of these genes encode transcription factors, such as GATA-2, RUNX1, ETV6, and C/EBPalpha, which establish and maintain genetic networks governing the genesis and function of blood stem and progenitor cells. Many questions remain unanswered regarding how genes and circuits within these networks function in physiology and disease and whether network integrity is exquisitely sensitive to or efficiently buffered from perturbations. In familial MDS/AML, mutations change the coding sequence of a gene to generate a mutant protein with altered activity or introduce frameshifts or stop codons or disrupt regulatory elements to alter protein expression. Each mutation has the potential to exert quantitatively and qualitatively distinct influences on networks. Consistent with this mechanistic diversity, disease onset is unpredictable and phenotypic variability can be considerable. Efforts to elucidate mechanisms and forge prognostic and therapeutic strategies must therefore contend with a spectrum of patient-specific leukemogenic scenarios. Here we illustrate mechanistic advances in our understanding of familial MDS/AML syndromes caused by germline mutations of hematopoietic transcription factors.","['Churpek, Jane E', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Churpek JE', 'Bresnick EH']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology and Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, UW Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190201,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC6355228,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['120854 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI120854 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2019 Feb 1;129(2):476-488. doi: 10.1172/JCI120854.

Of particular interest is the role of this compound in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), where it is a pivotal drug in the different treatment protocols, both at low and high doses. MTX acts on a variety of target enzymes in the folates cycle, as well as being transported out and into of the cell by several transmembrane proteins. METHODS: We undertook a structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature using a focused review question. RESULTS: This review has intended to summarize the current knowledge concerning the clinical impact of polymorphisms in enzymes and transporters involved in MTX disposition and mechanism of action on paediatric patients with ALL. CONCLUSION: In this work, we describe why, in spite of the significant research efforts, pharmacogenetics findings in this setting have not yet found their way into routine clinical practice.","['Gervasini, Guillermo', 'Mota-Zamorano, Sonia']","['Gervasini G', 'Mota-Zamorano S']","['Department of Medical & Surgical Therapeutics, Medical School, University of Extremadura, Av.

The prognostic significance of this translocation has not been well established due to the limited number of patients. Herein, we report three pediatric AML patients with t(7;21)(p22;q22). All three patients presented with pancytopenia or leukopenia at diagnosis, accompanied by abnormal immunophenotypic expression of CD7 and CD56 on leukemic blasts. One patient had t(7;21)(p22;q22) as the sole abnormality, whereas the other two patients had additional numerical and structural aberrations including loss of 5q material. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on interphase cells or sequential examination of metaphases showed the RUNX1 rearrangement and confirmed translocation 7;21. Genomic SNP microarray analysis, performed on DNA extracted from the bone marrow from the patient with isolated t(7;21)(p22;q22), showed a 32.2 Mb copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) within the short arm of chromosome 11. After 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy, all three patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). One patient died due to complications related to viral reactivation and graft-versus-host disease. The other two patients achieved complete remission after HSCT. Our data displayed the accompanying cytogenetic abnormalities including del(5q) and cnLOH of 11p, the frequent pathological features shared with other reported cases, and clinical outcome in pediatric AML patients with t(7;21)(p22;q22).

OBJECTIVE: To analyse and compare structure and serum IgE/IgG binding of rBet v 1 variants to Bet v 1.0101. METHODS: Recombinant Bet v 1 variants were studied with sera of 20 subjects allergic to birch pollen. Folding, aggregation and solubility of the rBet v 1 variants were analysed to attribute diverging IgE binding to either allergen structure or methodological features. IgE/IgG binding was studied with rBet v 1 in solution or adsorbed to solid phases. Allergen-mediated cross-linking of FcepsilonRI receptors was determined by mediator release of sensitized humanized rat basophil leukaemia cells. RESULTS: All variants, except for rBet v 1.0113, were monomeric and had Bet v 1-type conformation. Serum IgE binding to variants adsorbed to solid phase was reduced to 6.6%-36.5% compared with Bet v 1.0101. In contrast, inhibition of IgE binding to Bet v 1.0101 by rBet v 1 variants ranged from 62% to 83%. Similarly, mediator release ranged from 30.7% to 55.2% for all variants and was only clearly reduced for rBet v 1.0301 (10.4%). The IgE-binding potency of rBet v 1 variants representing their native quantities in birch pollen was only slightly lower compared to extract. IgG binding to variants was between 50.9% and 134.5% compared with rBet v 1.0101 (100%). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bet v 1 variants previously classified as hypoallergenic can exhibit similar functional IgE binding as Bet v 1.0101. Eight rBet v 1 variants largely reproduce total Bet v 1-specific IgE binding of birch pollen extracts. Assay format-dependent variation in IgE-binding properties needs to be considered in the development of diagnostic or therapeutic products.","['Seutter von Loetzen, Christian', 'Reuter, Andreas', 'Spiric, Jelena', 'Schulenborg, Thomas', 'Bellinghausen, Iris', 'Volker, Elke', 'Vogel, Lothar', 'Rosch, Paul', 'Schiller, Dirk']","['Seutter von Loetzen C', 'Reuter A', 'Spiric J', 'Schulenborg T', 'Bellinghausen I', 'Volker E', 'Vogel L', 'Rosch P', 'Schiller D']","['Department of Biopolymers, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Department of Biopolymers, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190214,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,,,2019/02/02 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cea.13356 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2019 May;49(5):712-723. doi: 10.1111/cea.13356.

However, data regarding the impact of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD status on hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) outcomes are limited. We examined the effect of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD status on transplant outcomes in 131 CN AML patients transplanted at Princess Margaret Hospital between 2006 and 2017. METHODS: Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were calculated using competing risk regression. RESULTS: There was no difference in 3-year OS among NPM1(+) /FLT3-ITD(-) , NPM1(-) /FLT3-ITD(-) , NPM1(+) /FLT3-ITD(+) and NPM1(-) /FLT3-ITD(+) patients: 56% (95% CI, 29%-76%), 61% (95% CI, 46%-73%), 53% (95% CI, 34%-70%) and 52% (95% CI, 17%-78%), respectively. CIR at 3-years was similar among NPM1(-) /FLT3-ITD(-) , NPM1(+) /FLT3-ITD(+) and NPM1(-) /FLT3-ITD(+) patients-14% (95% CI, 6%-26%), 13% (95% CI, 4%-28%) and 19% (95% CI, 4%-41%), respectively-while there were no relapses in the NPM1(+) /FLT3-ITD(-) group.

Based on Swedish Family Cancer Database, we applied bi-directional analyses in which relative risks (RRs) were calculated for any SPCs in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and the risks of these leukaemias as SPCs. After CLL, RRs were significant for 20 SPCs, and high for skin squamous cell cancer (24.58 for in situ and 7.63 for invasive), Merkel cell carcinoma (14.36), Hodgkin lymphoma (7.16) and Kaposi sarcoma (6.76). Conversely, 15 CLL cancer pairs were reciprocally increased. The increased risks were reciprocal for ALL and four cancers. RR for ALL was 15.35 after myeloid neoplasia. HCL showed reciprocally increased RRs with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma. The concordance between RRs for bi-directional associations between CLL and different cancers, and HCL and different cancers was highly significant. For CLL (also for HCL), the bi-directional risks with skin cancers and other immune-related cancers suggest the probable involvement of immune dysfunction. For ALL, treatment may contribute to risks of multiple SPCs. Increased risk of ALL after haematological neoplasms may indicate bone marrow dysfunction. These findings may help guide treatment decisions and prognostic assessment.","['Zheng, Guoqiao', 'Chattopadhyay, Subhayan', 'Sud, Amit', 'Sundquist, Kristina', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Houlston, Richard', 'Hemminki, Akseli', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Zheng G', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Sud A', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J', 'Forsti A', 'Houlston R', 'Hemminki A', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Centre for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Centre for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan.', 'Centre for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Centre for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Group, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190131,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,,2019/02/02 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15777 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Apr;185(2):232-239. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15777.

We report the case of a 45-year-old man with intellectual disability who developed ANKL, and describe the identification of a novel genetic mutation of coiled-coil domain-containing 22 (CCDC22). He presented with persistent fever, severe pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegary. Following bone marrow aspiration, numerous hemophagocytes were identified. High EBV viral load was detected in NK cells fractionation by qPCR. The initial diagnosis was EBV-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH). A combination of immunosuppressive drugs and chemotherapy was administered, but was unsuccessful in controlling the disease. Therefore, he was treated with HLA-matched related allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, his condition deteriorated within 30 days, resulting in fatal outcome. Autopsy revealed many EBV-infected NK cells infiltrating major organs, consistent with ANKL. Furthermore, whole-exome sequencing identified a novel missense mutation of the CCDC22 gene (c.112G>A, p.V38M), responsible for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). CCDC22 has been shown to play a role in NF-kappaB activation. Our case suggests that CCDC22 mutation might be implicated in pathogenesis of EBV-HLH and NK-cell neoplasms as well as XLID via possibly affecting NF-kappaB signaling.","['Yamashita, Yusuke', 'Nishikawa, Akinori', 'Iwahashi, Yoshifumi', 'Fujimoto, Masakazu', 'Sasaki, Izumi', 'Mishima, Hiroyuki', 'Kinoshita, Akira', 'Hemmi, Hiroaki', 'Kanazawa, Nobuo', 'Ohshima, Kouichi', 'Imadome, Ken-Ichi', 'Murata, Shin-Ichi', 'Yoshiura, Koh-Ichiro', 'Kaisho, Tsuneyasu', 'Sonoki, Takashi', 'Tamura, Shinobu']","['Yamashita Y', 'Nishikawa A', 'Iwahashi Y', 'Fujimoto M', 'Sasaki I', 'Mishima H', 'Kinoshita A', 'Hemmi H', 'Kanazawa N', 'Ohshima K', 'Imadome KI', 'Murata SI', 'Yoshiura KI', 'Kaisho T', 'Sonoki T', 'Tamura S']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Advanced Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Advanced Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medicine for Infections, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Advanced Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan. stamura@wakayama-med.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190131,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02595-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02595-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Jun;109(6):744-750. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02595-0.

The function of PRCs is frequently dysregulated in various cancer cells due to altered expression or recurrent somatic mutations in PRC genes. The tumor suppressive functions of EZH2-containing PRC2 and a PRC2-related protein ASXL1 have been investigated extensively in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).

There have been only seven cases of IFR caused by Cunninghamella reported in English and, of these, only three patients survived. In this article, we present another case of IFR caused by Cunninghamella, in which the patient was initially treated successfully but then deteriorated due to a relapse of leukemia 2 mo later. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old woman presented with a 2-mo history of right ocular proptosis, blurred vision, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction. Nasal endoscopic examination showed that the middle turbinate had become necrotic and fragile. Endoscopic sinus surgery and enucleation of the right orbital contents were performed successively. Additionally, the patient was treated with amphotericin B both systematically and topically. Secretion cultivation of the right eye canthus showed infection with Cunninghamella, while postoperative pathology also revealed fungal infection. The patient's condition gradually stabilized after surgery. However, the patient underwent chemotherapy again due to a relapse of leukemia 2 mo later. Unfortunately, her leukocyte count decreased dramatically, leading to a fatal lung infection and hemoptysis. CONCLUSION: Aggressive surgical debridements, followed by antifungal drug treatment both systematically and topically, are the most important fundamental treatments for IFR.","['Liu, Yong-Cai', 'Zhou, Min-Li', 'Cheng, Ke-Jia', 'Zhou, Shui-Hong', 'Wen, Xue', 'Chang, Cheng-Dong']","['Liu YC', 'Zhou ML', 'Cheng KJ', 'Zhou SH', 'Wen X', 'Chang CD']","['Department of Otolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, China. 1190051@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,PMC6354086,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts', 'of interest.']",2019/02/02 06:00,2019/02/02 06:01,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v7.i2.228 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2019 Jan 26;7(2):228-235. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v7.i2.228.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Case report', 'Cunninghamella', 'Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spectrum includes extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), aggressive NK-cell leukemia, and a group of EBV-TNKLPDs affecting children which are poorly characterized in terms of their molecular biology. Gene and miRNA expression profiling has elucidated RNA abnormalities which impact on disease biology, classification, and treatment of EBV-TNKLPD. Pathways promoting proliferation, such as Janus associated kinase/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) and nuclear factor kB, are upregulated in ENKTL while upregulation of survivin and deregulation of p53 inhibit apoptosis in both ENKTL and chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV). Importantly, immune evasion via the programmed cell death-1 and its ligand, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway, has been demonstrated to play an important role in ENKTL. Other pathogenic mechanisms involve EBV genes, microRNA deregulation, and a variety of other oncogenic signaling pathways. The identification of EBV-positive Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) as a tumor with a distinct molecular signature and clinical characteristics highlights the important contribution of the knowledge derived from gene and miRNA expression profiling in disease classification. Novel therapeutic targets identified through the study of RNA abnormalities provide hope for patients with EBV-TNKLPD, which often has a poor prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibition and JAK inhibition in particular have shown promise and are being evaluated in clinical trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the key transcriptomic aberrancies in EBV-TNKLPD and discuss their translational potential.","['de Mel, Sanjay', 'Tan, Joshua Zhi-Chien', 'Jeyasekharan, Anand D', 'Chng, Wee-Joo', 'Ng, Siok-Bian']","['de Mel S', 'Tan JZ', 'Jeyasekharan AD', 'Chng WJ', 'Ng SB']","['Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pathology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190117,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,PMC6344448,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/02/02 06:01,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2018.00405 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Jan 17;6:405. doi: 10.3389/fped.2018.00405. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'RNA', 'T cell lymphoma', 'chronic active EBV infection', 'extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, are currently the front-line treatment options for CML. Recently, natural killer (NK) cell activation and expansion have been shown to be associated with optimal treatment responses for CML. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of these TKIs on NK cells, here we characterized activating and inhibitory NK receptors in CD3(-)CD16(+)CD56(dim) NK cells isolated from CML patients in chronic phase (CP). The expressions of activating NK receptors, such as NKG2D, natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) and DNAM-1, rebounded after successful TKI treatments for CML. In contrast, among the three surveyed inhibitory receptors (NKG2A, KIR2DL1, and KIR3DL1), only the expression of NKG2A was reverted and suppressed to a very low level by dasatinib, and not by imatinib or nilotinib. CML patients treated with dasatinib indeed expressed fewer NKG2A+ NK cells, which send negative signals for induction of NK cytotoxicity. For these dasatinib-treated patients, the duration to reach major molecular response (MMR) was shorter, and significantly correlated with individual's NKG2A+ NK cell number. This clinical relevance to NKG2A was not observed in treatments with imatinib or nilotinib. In line with dasatinib-specific down-regulation of NKG2A, NK cytotoxicity evaluated by the killing assay was also significantly higher in patients treated with dasatinib than in those treated with imatinib or nilotinib. The lower NK cytotoxicity from imatinib or nilotinib treatments could be reverted by NKG2A blockade using anti-NKG2A antibody. Further in vitro experiments revealed mechanistically that dasatinib could inactivate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and consequently affect nuclear import of GATA-3 and GATA-3 transcriptional activities for NKG2A. Our results highlight the dual effects of dasatinib in direct inhibition of ABL kinase and in immunomodulation through NKG2A down-regulation, contributing to accelerated molecular responses (MR) in CML.","['Chang, Ming-Chin', 'Cheng, Hung-I', 'Hsu, Kate', 'Hsu, Yen-Ning', 'Kao, Chen-Wei', 'Chang, Yi-Fang', 'Lim, Ken-Hong', 'Chen, Caleb Gonshen']","['Chang MC', 'Cheng HI', 'Hsu K', 'Hsu YN', 'Kao CW', 'Chang YF', 'Lim KH', 'Chen CG']","['Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicine, MacKay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Transfusion Medicine & Immunogenetics Laboratories, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Tamsui, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.', 'GCRC Laboratory, Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicine, MacKay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'GCRC Laboratory, Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicine, MacKay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'GCRC Laboratory, Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicine, MacKay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'GCRC Laboratory, Department of Hematology, MacKay Memorial Hospital, New Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190117,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC6344416,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/10/15 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03152 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jan 17;9:3152. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03152. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*CML', '*NKG2A', '*deep molecular response (DMR)', '*major molecular response (MMR)', '*natural killer cell', '*p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase']",,,,,,20191014,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several tyrosine kinases (ie, EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR), are aberrantly activated in most common tumors, including leukemia, glioblastoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer, and head and neck cancers. Iclusig (ponatinib, previously known as AP24534) is an orally active multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, specifically targeting the BCR-ABL gene mutation, T315I. Due to ponatinib's unique multi-targeted characteristics, further studies have demonstrated its ability to target other important tyrosine kinases (FGFR, PDGFR, SRC, RET, KIT, and FLT1) in other human malignancies. This review focuses on the available data of ponatinib and its molecular targets for treatment in various cancers, with a discussion on the broader potential of this agent in other cancer indications.","['Tan, Fiona H', 'Putoczki, Tracy L', 'Stylli, Stanley S', 'Luwor, Rodney B']","['Tan FH', 'Putoczki TL', 'Stylli SS', 'Luwor RB']","['Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia, rluwor@unimelb.edu.au.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia.', 'Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia, rluwor@unimelb.edu.au.', 'Inflammation Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia.', 'Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia, rluwor@unimelb.edu.au.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia.', 'Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia, rluwor@unimelb.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190118,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC6343508,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2019/02/02 06:00,2019/02/02 06:01,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S189391 [doi]', 'ott-12-635 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Jan 18;12:635-645. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S189391. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer treatment', 'multi-kinase inhibitor', 'ponatinib', 'repurposing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high expression of stem-like programs in leukemias predicts poor prognosis and is assumed to act in an aberrant fashion in the phenotypically heterogeneous leukemia stem cell (LSC) population. A lack of suitable genome engineering tools that can isolate LSCs based on their stemness precludes their comprehensive examination and full characterization. We hypothesized that tagging endogenous stemness-regulatory regions could generate a genome reporter for the putative leukemia stemness-state. Our analysis revealed that the ERG + 85 enhancer region can serve as a marker for stemness-state and a fluorescent lentiviral reporter was developed that can accurately recapitulate the endogenous activity. Using our novel reporter, we revealed cellular heterogeneity in several leukemia cell lines and patient-derived samples. Alterations in reporter activity were associated with transcriptomic and functional changes that were closely related to the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) identity. Notably, the differentiation potential was skewed towards the erythro-megakaryocytic lineage. Moreover, an ERG + 85(High) fraction of AML cells could regenerate the original cellular heterogeneity and was enriched for LSCs. RNA-seq analysis coupled with in silico drug-screen analysis identified 4HPR as an effective inhibitor of ERG + 85(High) leukemia growth. We propose that further utilization of our novel molecular tool will identify crucial determinants of LSCs, thus providing a rationale for their therapeutic targeting.","['Yassin, Muhammad', 'Aqaqe, Nasma', 'Yassin, Abed Alkader', 'van Galen, Peter', 'Kugler, Eitan', 'Bernstein, Bradley E', 'Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Lechman, Eric R', 'Dick, John E', 'Wienholds, Erno', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Milyavsky, Michael']","['Yassin M', 'Aqaqe N', 'Yassin AA', 'van Galen P', 'Kugler E', 'Bernstein BE', 'Koren-Michowitz M', 'Canaani J', 'Nagler A', 'Lechman ER', 'Dick JE', 'Wienholds E', 'Izraeli S', 'Milyavsky M']","['Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.', 'Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Schneider Children Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', ""The Gene Development and Environment Pediatric Research Institute, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel."", 'Department of Molecular Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.', 'Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Schneider Children Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', ""The Gene Development and Environment Pediatric Research Institute, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel."", 'Department of Molecular Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel. mmilyavsky@post.tau.ac.il.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190131,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0386-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0386-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):2061-2077. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0386-z.

However, they also possess anticancer properties, which has prompted efforts to adapt MSCs for anticancer therapies. However, MSCs have also been widely implicated in pathways that contribute to tumor growth. Numerous studies have been conducted to adapt MSCs for further clinical use; however, the results have been inconclusive, possibly due to the heterogeneity of MSC populations. Moreover, the conflicting roles of MSCs in tumor inhibition and tumor growth impede their adaptation for anticancer therapies. Antitumorigenic and protumorigenic properties of MSCs in hematologic malignancies are not as well established as they are for solid malignancies, and data comparing them are still limited. Herein the effect of MSCs on hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, their mechanisms, sources of MSCs, and their effects on different types of cancer, have been discussed. This review describes how MSCs preserve both antitumorigenic and protumorigenic effects, as they tend to not only inhibit tumor growth by suppressing tumor cell proliferation but also promote tumor growth by suppressing tumor cell apoptosis. Thus clinical studies trying to adapt MSCs for anticancer therapies should consider that MSCs could actually promote hematologic cancer progression. It is necessary to take extreme care while developing MSC-based cell therapies in order to boost anticancer properties while eliminating tumor-favoring effects. This review emphasizes that research on the therapeutic applications of MSCs must consider that they exert both antitumorigenic and protumorigenic effects on hematologic malignancies.","['Lee, Myoung Woo', 'Ryu, Somi', 'Kim, Dae Seong', 'Lee, Ji Won', 'Sung, Ki Woong', 'Koo, Hong Hoe', 'Yoo, Keon Hee']","['Lee MW', 'Ryu S', 'Kim DS', 'Lee JW', 'Sung KW', 'Koo HH', 'Yoo KH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'CELLnLIFE Inc., Seoul, Korea.', 'Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'CELLnLIFE Inc., Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. hema2170@skku.edu.', 'Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. hema2170@skku.edu.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea. hema2170@skku.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190131,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6756083,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0373-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0373-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Mar;33(3):597-611. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0373-9.

The vast majority of patients have received autologous HSCT where an increasing evidence-base supports its use in a wide range of autoimmune diseases, particularly relapsing remitting MS, systemic sclerosis and Crohn's disease. Compared with standard treatments for autoimmune diseases, HSCT is associated with greater short-term risks, including a risk of treatment-related mortality and long-term complications. There is a need for a careful appraisal of potential benefits and risks by disease and transplant specialists working closely together with patients and carers to determine individual suitability for HSCT.

The drug was given intravenously at a dose of 2,500 IU/m(2) on days 12 and 26. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained on days 33 and 45 were analyzed centrally. Since physiological levels of asparagine in the cerebrospinal fluid of children and adolescents are 4-10 mumol/L, in this study asparagine depletion was considered complete when the concentration of asparagine was </=0.2 mumol/L, i.e. below the lower limit of quantification of the assay used. Over 24 months 736 patients (AIEOP n=245, BFM n=491) and 903 cerebrospinal fluid samples (n=686 on day 33 and n=217 on day 45) were available for analysis. Data were analyzed separately for the AIEOP and BFM cohorts and yielded superimposable results. Independently of serum asparaginase activity levels, cerebrospinal fluid asparagine levels were significantly reduced during the investigated study phase but only 28% of analyzed samples showed complete asparagine depletion while relevant levels, >/=1 mumol/L, were still detectable in around 23% of them. Complete cerebrospinal fluid asparagine depletion was found in around 5-6% and 33-37% of samples at serum asparaginase activity levels <100 and >/= 1,500 IU/L, respectively. In this study cerebrospinal fluid asparagine levels were reduced during pegylated-asparaginase treatment, but complete depletion was only observed in a minority of patients. No clear threshold of serum pegylated-asparaginase activity level resulting in complete cerebrospinal fluid asparagine depletion was identified. The consistency of the results found in the two independent data sets strengthen the observations of this study.

The negative effects of dysregulated DNA methylation are highlighted by a strong correlation between mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase gene DNA methyltransferase 3alpha (DNMT3A) and poor prognoses among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We show here that clinically observed DNMT3A mutations dramatically alter enzymatic activity, including mutations that lead to 6-fold hypermethylation and 3-fold hypomethylation of the human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B or p15) gene promoter. Our results provide insights into the clinically observed heterogeneity of p15 methylation in AML. Cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) constitutes 40-50% of all AML cases and is the most epigenetically diverse AML subtype with pronounced changes in non-CpG DNA methylation. We identified a subset of DNMT3A mutations that enhance the enzyme's ability to perform non-CpG methylation by 2-8-fold. Many of these mutations mapped to DNMT3A regions known to interact with proteins that themselves contribute to AML, such as thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). Using functional mapping of TDG-DNMT3A interactions, we provide evidence that TDG and DNMT3-like (DNMT3L) bind distinct regions of DNMT3A. Furthermore, DNMT3A mutations caused diverse changes in the ability of TDG and DNMT3L to affect DNMT3A function.

With the development of national insurance for underprivileged patients, we assessed the current frequency and causes of treatment abandonment among patients with ALL who were enrolled in the Chinese Children's Cancer Group ALL protocol between 2015 and 2016. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data on patients who abandoned treatment, as well as economic and sociocultural data of their families were collected and analysed. General health-related statistics were retrieved from publicly accessible databanks maintained by the Chinese government. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 119 weeks, 83 (3.1%, 95% CI 2.5% to 3.8%) of the 2641 patients abandoned treatment. Factors independently associated with abandonment included standard/high-risk ALL (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.77), presence of minimal residual disease at the end of remission induction (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.90 to 6.74) and low-income economic region (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.89 to 7.05). According to the family members, economic constraints (50.6%, p=0.0001) were the main reason for treatment abandonment, followed by the belief of incurability, severe side effects and concern over late complications. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of ALL treatment abandonment has been greatly reduced in China. Standard/high-risk ALL, residence in a low-income region and economic difficulties were associated with treatment abandonment.

In group B, if patients did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 3 months or did not achieve a major molecular response (MR3) at 6 months, imatinib was increased to 600 mg. At 6 months CCyR was achieved in 69.4% and 78.7% of patients in groups A and B, respectively. The rate of MR3 at 12 months and 24 months were similar in group A (52.1% and 70.0%) and group B (58.7% and 68.3%). The cumulative incidence of withdrawal by failure without accelerated/blast phase was higher in group A than in group B (9.2% vs 2.5% at 24 months). At 3 and 6 months, the protocol called for the imatinib dose to increase to 600 mg in 90 patients (74.4%) in group B. Among the 42 patients who received increased dose according to the protocol, 25 (60.0%) achieved MR3 at 12 months, whereas only 14 (35.0%) of 40 patients who did not receive an increased dose achieved MR3 (P < .05). The number of patients who withdrew from this study was similar (group A, 20%; group B, 21%). The early aggressive dose escalation failed to produce a better molecular response at 12 months. However, for patients who tolerate imatinib well, but show inadequate response at an early time point, aggressive dose escalation may contribute to achieving a better outcome.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a monocentric, randomized trial of patients with previously untreated AML. Of the 93 patients, 46 had received a PICC and 47 had received a CICC as frontline intravascular device. Thereafter, all patients underwent intensive chemotherapy for hematologic remission induction. The primary endpoint was catheter-related (CR)-bloodstream infection (BSI) and venous thrombosis (VT) rate. The secondary endpoints catheter malfunction, catheter removal, and patient overall survival. RESULTS: The CR-BSI and CR-VT rate in the PICC and CICC groups was 13% and 49%, respectively, with a difference of 36 percentage points (relative risk for CR-BSI or CR-VT, 0.266; P = .0003). The CR-BSI incidence was 1.4 and 7.8 per 1000 catheters daily in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. Among the CR thromboses, the symptomatic VT rate was 2.1% in the PICC group and 10.6% in the CICC group. In the CICC group, 16 of the 47 patients (34%) had the catheter removed for BSI (n = 5), septic thrombophlebitis (n = 4), VT (n = 2), or malfunction (n = 5) a median of 7 days after insertion. In the PICC group, only 6 of the 46 patients (13%) required catheter removal for VT (n = 2) or malfunction (n = 4). At a median follow-up of 30 days, 6 patients in the CICC group died of CR complications versus none of the patients in the PICC group (P = .012). Using PICCs, the reduction in BSI and symptomatic VT decreased mortality from CR infection and venous thromboembolism. In contrast, the CICC approach led to early catheter removal mostly for difficult-to-treat infectious pathogens. CONCLUSION: Our data have confirmed that BSI and symptomatic VT are the major complications affecting frontline central intravascular device-related morbidity in the leukemia setting. The use of a PICC is safer than that of a CICC and maintains the effectiveness for patients with AML undergoing chemotherapy, with an approximate fourfold lower combined risk of infection or thrombosis at 30 days.","['Picardi, Marco', 'Della Pepa, Roberta', 'Cerchione, Claudio', 'Pugliese, Novella', 'Mortaruolo, Chiara', 'Trastulli, Fabio', 'Giordano, Claudia', 'Grimaldi, Francesco', 'Zacheo, Irene', 'Raimondo, Marta', 'Chiurazzi, Federico', 'Pane, Fabrizio']","['Picardi M', 'Della Pepa R', 'Cerchione C', 'Pugliese N', 'Mortaruolo C', 'Trastulli F', 'Giordano C', 'Grimaldi F', 'Zacheo I', 'Raimondo M', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Pane F']","['Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.

Eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, stimulates platelet production by a similar mechanism to endogenous thrombopoietin. This study investigated safety and efficacy of eltrombopag versus placebo during anthracycline-based induction treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study, treatment-naive patients were recruited from clinical centres across 10 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Greece, Hungary, Israel, South Korea, Poland, Russia, and the USA). Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia of any subtype except M3 and M7 were stratified by antecedent malignant haematological disorder (yes or no) and age (18-60 years or >60 years) and were then randomly assigned (1:1) using an automated interactive voice-response system randomisation schedule. Investigators and patients were blinded to study treatment. Starting on day 4, patients received standard induction chemotherapy (daunorubicin bolus intravenous infusion on days 1-3 [90 mg/m(2) for patients aged 18-60 years or 60 mg/m(2) for patients aged >60 years], plus cytarabine continuous intravenous infusion on days 1-7 [100 mg/m(2)]), with eltrombopag 200 mg (100 mg for east Asians) or placebo once daily, until platelet counts were 200 x 10(9)/L or higher, until remission, or after 42 days from the start of induction chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study was safety and tolerability assessed by adverse events, changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and clinical laboratory parameters in all treated patients. This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01890746. FINDINGS: Between Sept 7, 2013, and Jan 30, 2015, 149 patients were assessed for eligibility and 148 were then randomly assigned to receive eltrombopag (n=74) and placebo (n=74). Groups were matched in mean (SD) age (56.7 years [12.3] in the eltrombopag group vs 56.6 years [11.6] in the placebo group), mean (SD) initial platelet count (59.5 x 10(9)/L [43.3] vs 63.7 x 10(9)/L [48.0]), and poor-risk karyotype (16 [22%] of 74 patients in both groups). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events (>/=10% in either group) were febrile neutropenia (31 [42%] vs 28 [39%]), decreased white blood cell count (8 [11%] vs 5 [7%]), and hypophosphataemia (3 [4%] vs 9 [13%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 24 (32%) patients in the eltrombopag group compared with 14 (20%) patients in the placebo group. 39 (53%) patients in the eltrombopag group died versus 29 (41%) patients in the placebo group. Thromboembolic events (5 [7%] vs 4 [6%]) and mean (SD) change in LVEF (-2.5% [7.8] vs -4.3% [8.5]) were similar. INTERPRETATION: Data from this trial do not support combining eltrombopag with induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.

The class-I carcinogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp) activates the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl to phosphorylate the oncoprotein cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA). The role of c-Abl in CagA-dependent pathways is well established; however, the knowledge of CagA-independent c-Abl processes is scarce. METHODS: c-Abl phosphorylation and localization were analyzed by immunostaining and immunofluorescence. Interaction partners were identified by tandem-affinity purification. Cell elongation and migration were analyzed in transwell-filter experiments. Apoptosis and cell survival were examined by FACS analyses and MTT assays. In mice experiments and human biopsies, the involvement of c-Abl in Hp pathogenesis was investigated. RESULTS: Here, we investigated the activity and subcellular localization of c-Abl in vitro and in vivo and unraveled the contribution of c-Abl in CagA-dependent and -independent pathways to gastric Hp pathogenesis. We report a novel mechanism and identified strong c-Abl threonine 735 phosphorylation (pAbl(T735)) mediated by the type-IV secretion system (T4SS) effector D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose-1,7-bisphosphate (betaHBP) and protein kinase C (PKC) as a new c-Abl kinase. pAbl(T735) interacted with 14-3-3 proteins, which caused cytoplasmic retention of c-Abl, where it potentiated Hp-mediated cell elongation and migration. Further, the nuclear exclusion of pAbl(T735) attenuated caspase-8 and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, in human patients suffering from Hp-mediated gastritis c-Abl expression and pAbl(T735) phosphorylation were drastically enhanced as compared to type C gastritis patients or healthy individuals. Pharmacological inhibition using the selective c-Abl kinase inhibitor Gleevec confirmed that c-Abl plays an important role in Hp pathogenesis in a murine in vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified a novel regulatory mechanism in Hp-infected gastric epithelial cells by which Hp determines the subcellular localization of activated c-Abl to control Hp-mediated EMT-like processes while decreasing cell death.","['Posselt, Gernot', 'Wiesauer, Maria', 'Chichirau, Bianca E', 'Engler, Daniela', 'Krisch, Linda M', 'Gadermaier, Gabriele', 'Briza, Peter', 'Schneider, Sabine', 'Boccellato, Francesco', 'Meyer, Thomas F', 'Hauser-Kronberger, Cornelia', 'Neureiter, Daniel', 'Muller, Anne', 'Wessler, Silja']","['Posselt G', 'Wiesauer M', 'Chichirau BE', 'Engler D', 'Krisch LM', 'Gadermaier G', 'Briza P', 'Schneider S', 'Boccellato F', 'Meyer TF', 'Hauser-Kronberger C', 'Neureiter D', 'Muller A', 'Wessler S']","['Department of Biosciences, Division of Microbiology, University of Salzburg, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Billroth Str. 11, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Biosciences, Division of Microbiology, University of Salzburg, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Billroth Str. 11, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Biosciences, Division of Microbiology, University of Salzburg, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Billroth Str. 11, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biosciences, Division of Microbiology, University of Salzburg, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Billroth Str. 11, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Biosciences, Division of Allergy and Immunology, University of Salzburg, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Hellbrunner Str. 34, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Biosciences, Division of Allergy and Immunology, University of Salzburg, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Hellbrunner Str. 34, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Paul-Ehrlich-Str. 51-59, D-63225, Langen, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Chariteplatz 1, D-10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Chariteplatz 1, D-10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Mullner Hauptstrasse 48, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Mullner Hauptstrasse 48, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, University of Salzburg, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biosciences, Division of Microbiology, University of Salzburg, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Billroth Str. 11, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria. silja.wessler@sbg.ac.at.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, University of Salzburg, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria. silja.wessler@sbg.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190131,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,PMC6357398,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12964-019-0323-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12964-019-0323-9 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2019 Jan 31;17(1):10. doi: 10.1186/s12964-019-0323-9.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*C-Abl', '*Cancer', '*Gastritis', '*Helicobacter pylori', '*Motility', '*PKC', '*betaHBP']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7011-6162'],,,20190612,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'Helicobacter Infections/metabolism/microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism']","['1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present our results of the analysis of an extended mathematical model describing abnormal human hematopoiesis. The model is able to describe the course of an acute myeloid leukemia including its treatment. In first-line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, the induction chemotherapy aims for a rapid leukemic cell reduction. We consider combinations of cytarabine and anthracycline-like chemotherapy. Both substances are widely used as standard treatment to achieve first remission. In particular, we compare two scenarios: a single-induction course with 7 days cytarabine and 3 day of anthracycline-like treatment (7 + 3) with a 7 + 3 course and a bone marrow evaluation that leads, in case of insufficient leukemic cell reduction, to the provision of a second chemotherapy course. Three scenarios, based on the leukemias growth kinetics (slow, intermediate, fast), were analyzed. We simulated different intensity combinations for both therapy schemata (7 + 3 and 7 + 3 + evaluation). RESULTS: Our model shows that within the 7 + 3 regimen a wider range of intensity combinations result in a complete remission (CR), compared to 7 + 3 + evaluation (fast: 64.3% vs 46.4%; intermediate: 63.7% vs 46.7%; slow: 0% vs 0%). Additionally, the number of simulations resulting in a prolonged CR was higher within the standard regimen (fast: 59.8% vs 40.1%; intermediate: 48.6% vs 31.0%; slow: 0% vs 0%). On the contrary, the 7 + 3 + evaluation regimen allows CR and prolonged CR by lower chemotherapy intensities compared to 7 + 3. Leukemic pace has a strong impact on treatment response and especially on specific effective doses. As a result, faster leukemias are characterized by superior treatment outcomes and can be treated effectively with lower treatment intensities. CONCLUSIONS: We could show that 7 + 3 treatment has considerable more chemotherapy combinations leading to a first CR. However, the 7 + 3 + evaluation regimen leads to CR for lower therapy intensity and presumably less side effects. An additional evaluation can be considered beneficial to control therapy success, especially in low dose settings. The treatment success is dependent on leukemia growth dynamics. The determination of leukemic pace should be a relevant part of a personalized medicine.","['Banck, Jan Christoph', 'Gorlich, Dennis']","['Banck JC', 'Gorlich D']","['Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Germany. dennis.goerlich@ukmuenster.de.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190131,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,PMC6357450,,2019/02/02 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12918-019-0684-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12918-019-0684-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2019 Jan 31;13(1):18. doi: 10.1186/s12918-019-0684-0.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*First line induction therapy', '*Mathematical model', '*Systems medicine']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2574-9419'],,,20200106,IM,"['Anthracyclines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Computer Simulation', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', '*Systems Biology', 'Time Factors']","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WMW has been shown to alleviate damage in pancreatic beta cells, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to explore how WMW plays a protective role in pancreatic islets. METHODS: Drug testing and mechanism analyses were performed on mice treated with three concentrations of WMW (4800, 9600, and 19,200 mg/kg/bw) for four consecutive weeks. Blood was collected from both db/db and wild-type mice to determine fasting blood glucose (FBG) and serum insulin levels. The expression of proteins related to apoptosis, cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase 12 (caspase-12) and B-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), was measured by western blot. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-18 (IL-18), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1alpha (MCP-1alpha), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the pancreas were tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry staining of F4/80 was performed to measure the pancreatic infiltration of macrophages. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining of the NLRP3 inflammasome were used to measure the expression of proteins related to apoptosis and inflammation. RESULTS: WMW dose-dependently reduced FBG and promoted serum insulin secretion in db/db mice compared to the wild-type controls. WMW protected pancreatic beta cells with a pattern of decreasing caspase-12 and increasing Bcl-2 expression. WMW also reversed the upregulated production of IL-1beta, IL-18, MCP-1alpha, and macrophage-specific surface glycoprotein F4/80 in diabetic mice. In addition, the protein expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 (P20) were higher in db/db mice than in wild-type controls. CONCLUSIONS: WMW inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to protect pancreatic beta cells and prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus development.","['Yang, Xueping', 'Lu, Fuer', 'Li, Lingli', 'Li, Jingbin', 'Luo, Jinlong', 'Zhang, Siyi', 'Liu, Xinqiao', 'Chen, Guang']","['Yang X', 'Lu F', 'Li L', 'Li J', 'Luo J', 'Zhang S', 'Liu X', 'Chen G']","['Institute of Integrative Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Institute of Integrative Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430033, China.', 'Department of Integrative Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Emergency, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'College of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430061, China.', 'School of Pharmceutical Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Integrative Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. ggwuhan@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190131,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,PMC6357370,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12906-019-2443-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-019-2443-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2019 Jan 31;19(1):35. doi: 10.1186/s12906-019-2443-6.,['NOTNLM'],"['NLRP3 inflammasome', 'Pancreatic beta cells', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus', 'Wu-Mei-wan']",['No. 81403254/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,,,20190305,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Inflammasomes/antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protective Agents/*pharmacology']","['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (Nlrp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protective Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by clonal proliferation of EBV-infected T or NK cells and their infiltration into systemic organs, leading to their failure. Inflammatory symptoms, fever, lymphadenopathy and liver dysfunction are main clinical findings of CAEBV. EBV itself contributes to the survival of the host cells via induction of CD40 and CD137 expression and constitutive activation of NF-kappaB. Accumulation of gene mutations in the infected cells may lead to the development of highly malignant lymphoma or leukemia. Furthermore, constitutive activation of STAT3 is detected in the infected cells, which not only promotes cell survival but also enhances production of inflammatory cytokines. Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only effective treatment strategy for eradication of EBV-infected T or NK cells. However, active disease at the time of allo-HSCT (defined as presence of fever, liver dysfunction, progressive skin lesions, vasculitis or uveitis) is a negative prognostic factor. Establishment of chemotherapy regimens for effective resolution of disease activity in patients with CAEBV is a key imperative. Based on the recently unraveled molecular mechanisms CAEBV development, pathways mediated by NF-kappaB or JAK/STAT are potential novel therapeutic targets.","['Arai, Ayako']",['Arai A'],"['a Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences , Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) , Tokyo , Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190131,England,Immunol Med,Immunological medicine,101736847,,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/02/02 06:01,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:01 [medline]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/25785826.2018.1556030 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Med. 2018 Dec;41(4):162-169. doi: 10.1080/25785826.2018.1556030.

Methods: A total of 121 newly diagnosed pediatric CBF-AML patients enrolled from Aug. 2005 to Sep. 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic factors were evaluated by Cox regression with SPSS. Results: Of the 121 patients, 120 patients were assessed for bone marrow remission after induction chemotherapy. 100 cases (83.3%) achieved complete remission (CR) after the first course of chemotherapy. 119 cases (99.2%) achieved CR after the second course of chemotherapy. Of the 121 patients, 13 patients (10.7%) had recurrence with the median interval of recurrence as 13.8 months (3.7 to 58.8 months). 17 patients (14.0%) died. The CIR, EFS and OS at 3 years were 12.7%, 77.5% and 82.8%, respectively. The factors including age at diagnosis, sex, initial WBC count, presence of extramedullary leukemia, C-KIT expression, additional chromosomal abnormalities, and CR after the first course of chemotherapy were analyzed by multivariate regression analysis of Cox. Multivariate analysis identified that additional chromosomal abnormalities was the only independent risk factor affecting OS (HR=4.289, 95%CI 1.070-17.183, P=0.040). Conclusions: Pediatric CBF-AML was a unique setting of prognostic subtypes. Chemotherapy produced good responses. Additional chromosomal abnormalities was the only independent risk factor for OS in pediatric CBF-AML.","['Wu, J', 'Lu, A D', 'Zhang, L P', 'Zuo, Y X', 'Jia, Y P']","['Wu J', 'Lu AD', 'Zhang LP', 'Zuo YX', 'Jia YP']","[""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7351698,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.01.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jan 14;40(1):52-57. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.01.010.,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood', 'Core binding factor', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Prognosis DOI: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.01.010']",,,,,,20190405,IM,"['Child', 'Core Binding Factors', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",['0 (Core Binding Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The expressions of MPO in BM blasts cells of 233 newly diagnosed AML were retrospectived analyzed, they were divided into two groups using the percentage of MPO-positive blast [low (</=70%) and high (>70%)], clinical features, gene alterations, chemotherapy efficacy and prognosis were compared between the two groups. Results: 1 in circleOf the 233 patients, 121(51.9%) were in the low MPO group, and the rest 112(48.1%) in the high MPO group. Favorable-risk group according NCCN guidelines of AML was always MPO-high (chi(2)=32.773, P<0.001), while MPO-low was closely related to poor-risk (chi(2)=7.078, P=0.008); 2 in circleDNMT3A mutation (chi(2)=6.905, P=0.009), spliceosome genes mutation (SF3B1/SRSF2/U2AF1) (chi(2)=5.246, P=0.022), RUNX1 mutation (chi(2)=4.577, P=0.032), ASXL1 mutation (chi(2)=7.951, P=0.005) and TP53 mutation (P=0.004) were more likely to be seen in the low MPO group, while C-KIT mutation (chi(2)=8.936, P=0.003) and CEBPA mutation (chi(2)=12.340, P<0.001) were more frequent in the high MPO group, especially CEBPA double mutation; 3 in circleThe rates of first complete remission in the low MPO group were significantly lower than that in the high MPO group (38.8% vs 68.1%, chi(2)=15.197, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that low MPO positivity significantly affected the CR(1) unfavourably. 4 in circleThe overall survival (OS) and the progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly worse in the low MPO group (18.0% vs 89.4% for OS, and 11.5% vs 56.7% for PFS, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis disclosed that the low number of MPO was significantly unfavourable prognostic factor. The low MPO group still showed a worse survival even when restricted to the patients with normal karyotype, the OS and the PFS were 31.1% and 18.8% respectively. Conclusions: AML with different MPO expression percentage had a unique gene mutation spectrum. Low expression of MPO was an independent risk factor for CR(1), OS and PFS in AML patients, which may be a simple and highly significant factor for AML patients when evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis.","['Dong, X Y', 'Li, Y L', 'Jiang, L', 'Wu, C Y', 'Shang, B J', 'Zhang, L', 'Cheng, W', 'Zhu, Z M']","['Dong XY', 'Li YL', 'Jiang L', 'Wu CY', 'Shang BJ', 'Zhang L', 'Cheng W', 'Zhu ZM']","[""Institute of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450003, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7351695,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.01.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jan 14;40(1):40-45. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.01.008.,['NOTNLM'],"['Lukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Mutation', 'Myeloperoxidase', 'Prognosis']",['201403186/Key Program of Medical Technologies of Henan Province'],,,,,20190405,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation', 'Peroxidase', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The CGA results of 83 newly diagnosed AML (non-APL) patients from 16 hospitals in Beijing and Tianjin between March 2016 and December 2017 were prospectively collected and analyzed. The clinical data, treatment and follow-up information were also collected. Results: Of 83 newly diagnosed elderly AML patients, 81 patients (97.6%) completed all designated CGA assessment. The median number of impaired scales of the CGA assessment in the studied population was 2(0-6). Sixteen patients (19.3%) showed no impairments according to the geriatric assessment scales implem ented by this study. The distributions of impaired scales were as follows: impairment in ADL, 55.4%; IADL impairment, 42.2%; MNA-SF impairment, 48.2%; cognitive impairment, 15.7%; GDS impairment, 31.7%; HCT-CI impairment, 19.5%, respectively. In patients with ""good"" ECOG (n=46), the proportion of impairment for each CGA scale ranged from 6.5% to 37.0% and 32 patients (68.9%) had at least one impaired CGA scale.

The HSPCs pool is reduced with ageing resulting in few HSPC clones maintaining haematopoiesis thereby reducing blood cell diversity, a phenomenon called clonal haematopoiesis. Clonal expansion of HSPCs carrying specific genetic mutations leads to increased risk for haematological malignancies. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that hematopoietic tumours develop in higher frequency in elderly people. Unfortunately, elderly patients with leukaemia or lymphoma still have an unsatisfactory prognosis compared to younger ones highlighting the need to develop more efficient therapies for this group of patients. Growing evidence indicates that macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is essential for health and longevity. This review is focusing on the role of autophagy in normal haematopoiesis as well as in leukaemia and lymphoma development. Attenuated autophagy may support early hematopoietic neoplasia whereas activation of autophagy in later stages of tumour development and in response to a variety of therapies rather triggers a pro-tumoral response. Novel insights into the role of autophagy in haematopoiesis will be discussed in light of designing new autophagy modulating therapies in hematopoietic cancers.","['Djavaheri-Mergny, Mojgan', 'Giuriato, Sylvie', 'Tschan, Mario P', 'Humbert, Magali']","['Djavaheri-Mergny M', 'Giuriato S', 'Tschan MP', 'Humbert M']","['INSERM U1218, Universite de Bordeaux, 33076 Bordeaux, France. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM U1138, 75006 Paris, France. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75006 Paris, France. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Sorbonne Universite, 75006 Paris, France. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'Cell Biology and Metabolomics platforms, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, 94800 Villejuif, France. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'TRANSAUTOPHAGY: European network for multidisciplinary research and translation of autophagy knowledge, COST Action CA15138. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'TRANSAUTOPHAGY: European network for multidisciplinary research and translation of autophagy knowledge, COST Action CA15138. sylvie.giuriato@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM, UMR1037 CRCT, F-31000 Toulouse, France. sylvie.giuriato@inserm.fr.', 'Universite Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier, UMR1037 CRCT, F-31000 Toulouse, France. sylvie.giuriato@inserm.fr.', 'CNRS, ERL5294 CRCT, F-31000 Toulouse, France. sylvie.giuriato@inserm.fr.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. sylvie.giuriato@inserm.fr."", 'European Research Initiative on ALK-related malignancies (ERIA), F-31000 Toulouse, France. sylvie.giuriato@inserm.fr.', 'TRANSAUTOPHAGY: European network for multidisciplinary research and translation of autophagy knowledge, COST Action CA15138. mario.tschan@pathology.unibe.ch.', 'Institute of Pathology, Division of Experimental Pathology, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, CH-3008 Bern, Switzerland. mario.tschan@pathology.unibe.ch.', 'Institute of Pathology, Division of Experimental Pathology, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, CH-3008 Bern, Switzerland. magali.humbert@pathology.unibe.ch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190130,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,PMC6406467,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],2019/02/02 06:00,2019/02/02 06:01,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:01 [medline]']","['cells8020103 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8020103 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Jan 30;8(2). pii: cells8020103. doi: 10.3390/cells8020103.,['NOTNLM'],"['*ageing', '*haematopoiesis', '*leukaemia', '*lymphomas', '*macroautophagy', '*therapy response']",,,,,,20191203,IM,"['Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, recent preclinical evidences suggest that this drug could be useful for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, since it targets cSrc tyrosin kinase. Based on these considerations, the purpose of this work was to use the strategy of complexation with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) in order to obtain an aqueous preparation of DAS, which is characterized by a low water solubility (6.49 x 10(-4) mg/mL). Complexation studies demonstrated that HP-beta-CD is able to form a stable host-guest inclusion complex with DAS with a 1:1 apparent formation constant of 922.13 M(-1), as also demonstrated by the Job's plot, with an increase in DAS aqueous solubility of about 21 times in the presence of 6% w/v of HP-beta-CD (0.014 mg/mL). The inclusion complex has been prepared in the solid state by lyophilization and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) techniques, and its dissolution profile was studied at different pH values. Moreover, in view of potential use of DAS for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the cytotoxic effect of the inclusion complex has been assessed on C2C12 cells, a murine muscle satellite cell line. In parallel, a one-week oral treatment was performed in wild type C57Bl/6J mice to test both palatability and the exposure levels of the new oral formulation of the compound. In conclusion, this new inclusion complex could allow the development of a liquid and solvent free formulation to be administered both orally and parenterally, especially in the case of an administration in paediatric age.","['Cutrignelli, Annalisa', 'Sanarica, Francesca', 'Lopalco, Antonio', 'Lopedota, Angela', 'Laquintana, Valentino', 'Franco, Massimo', 'Boccanegra, Brigida', 'Mantuano, Paola', 'De Luca, Annamaria', 'Denora, Nunzio']","['Cutrignelli A', 'Sanarica F', 'Lopalco A', 'Lopedota A', 'Laquintana V', 'Franco M', 'Boccanegra B', 'Mantuano P', 'De Luca A', 'Denora N']","['Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. annalisa.cutrignelli@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. francesca.sanarica88@gmail.com.', 'Unity of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. francesca.sanarica88@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. antonio.lopalco@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. angelaassunta.lopedota@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. valentino.laquintana@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. massimo.franco@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. brigida.boccanegra@uniba.it.', 'Unity of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. brigida.boccanegra@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. paola.mantuano@uniba.it.', 'Unity of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. paola.mantuano@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. annamaria.deluca@uniba.it.', 'Unity of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. annamaria.deluca@uniba.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy-Drug Sciences, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy. nunzio.denora@uniba.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190130,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6386909,,2019/02/02 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2019/02/02 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20030591 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20030591 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jan 30;20(3). pii: ijms20030591. doi: 10.3390/ijms20030591.,['NOTNLM'],"['Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'cyclodextrin inclusion complex', 'dasatinib', 'liquid formulation', 'paediatric age', 'phase solubility studies']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1266-638X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6339-2222']",,,20190513,IM,"['2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dasatinib/*chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne', 'Neuromuscular Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Solubility', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']","['1I96OHX6EK (2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A molecular signature in hMSCs from Acute myeloid leukemia patients (hMSC-AML) has been proposed where BMP4 is decreased and could be regulated by WNT signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of this work was to verify whether the WNT signaling pathway can regulate the BMP4 gene in hMSCs. The results showed differentially expressed genes in the WNT canonical pathway between hMSC-AML and hMSCs from healthy donors and a real-time quantitative assay corroborated with these findings. Moreover, the main WNT canonical pathway regulators were decreased in hMSC-AML, such as LEF-1, beta-catenin and the beta-catenin/TCF-LEF regulatory complex in the nucleus. This result, together with functional assays, suggests that the induction of BMP4 expression by the WNT signaling pathway is decreased in hMSC-AML. Overall, the WNT canonical pathway is able to regulate the BMP4 gene in hMSC-AML and its reduced activation could also lead to the lower expression of BMP4 in hMSC-AML. Due to the important role of the BMM, changes in BMP4 expression through the WNT canonical pathway may be a potential mechanism of leukemogenesis.","['Azevedo, Pedro L', 'Oliveira, Nathalia C A', 'Correa, Stephany', 'Castelo-Branco, Morgana T L', 'Abdelhay, Eliana', 'Binato, Renata']","['Azevedo PL', 'Oliveira NCA', 'Correa S', 'Castelo-Branco MTL', 'Abdelhay E', 'Binato R']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences and Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

Therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of these procedures notwithstanding, the occurrence of late adverse effects remains a cause of clinical concern in leukemia survivors. We propose an experimental mouse model to mimic the impact of methotrexate exposure on brain biochemistry and cell proliferation, as well as behavioral and neurocognitive functioning at adult age. Female C57Bl6/J mouse pups received saline or methotrexate injection (20mg/kg, i.p.). CSF and serum concentrations of folate metabolites and toxicity makers were analyzed at 4h, 24h, and 1week following injection. Behavioral test battery performance was assessed at adult age (3-4months). We found acute changes in serum and CSF levels of folate in exposed pups that coincided with increases in CSF Tau, whereas homocysteine in serum and CSF, and CSF levels of pTau were unchanged or remained below detection. In addition, methotrexate injection coincided with diminished hippocampal cell proliferation 1week after methotrexate injection. At adult age, exposed mice displayed hippocampus-dependent deficits in the Morris water maze, whereas exploration and anxiety-related behaviors were largely unaffected. Particularly during the reference memory (probe) trial after reversal learning, methotrexate-exposed animals were less precise than controls. These findings demonstrate adult neurocognitive sequelae in a mouse model that can be attributed to the biochemical and cellular impact of early-life methotrexate exposure.","['Elens, Iris', 'Dekeyster, Eline', 'Moons, Lieve', ""D'Hooge, Rudi""]","['Elens I', 'Dekeyster E', 'Moons L', ""D'Hooge R""]","['Laboratory of Biological Psychology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Centre Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Animal Physiology and Neurobiology Unit, Zoological Institute, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Janssen Vaccines and Prevention B.V., Johnson & Johnson, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Animal Physiology and Neurobiology Unit, Zoological Institute, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Biological Psychology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

AIM OF THE STUDY: This work was designed to determine the cytotoxicity of the crude extract (FTB), fractions (FTBa-d) and compounds isolated from the bark of Fagara tessmannii, namely lupeol (1), fagaramide (2), zanthoxyline (3), hesperidin (4), nitidine chloride (5), fagaridine chloride (6), and beta-sitosterol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7). The study was extended to the mode of induction of apoptosis by FTB, compounds 5 and 6. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of samples. The cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. Column chromatography was used for the purification of FTB. Meanwhile, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis was applied for structural elucidation. RESULTS: The crude extract, fractions FTBa, FTBc, FTBd as well as compounds 5 and 6 revealed cytotoxicity towards the 9 tested cancer cell lines. The IC50 values ranged from 17.34microg/mL (towards U87MG.DeltaEGFR glioblastoma cells) to 40.68microg/mL (against CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) for FTB, from 16.78microg/mL (towards U87. MGDeltaEGFR cells) to 37.42microg/mL (against CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) for FTBa, from 19.47microg/mL (towards U87. MG glioblastoma cells) to 41.62microg/mL (against CCRF-CEM cells) for FTBc, from 14.17microg/mL (against HCT116p53(-/-) colon adenocarcinoma cells) to 22.28microg/mL (towards CEM-ADR5000 cells) for FTBd, from 1.75microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 23.52microM (against U87. MGDeltaEGFR cells) for compound 5, from 1.69microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 22.06microM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for compound 6 and from 0.02microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. FTB induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by enhanced ROS production. Compound 5 induced apoptosis through caspases activation and increase ROS production. Meanwhile, 6 induced apoptosis mediated by caspases activation, MMP alteration and enhanced ROS production. CONCLUSION: Fagara tessmannii as well as its constituents 5 and 6 revealed considerable cytotoxicity and may be suitable candidates deserving to be further explored to develop new anticancer drugs to combat sensitive and resistant phenotypes.","['Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Damen, Francois', 'Celik, Ilhami', 'Tane, Pierre', 'Kuete, Victor', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Mbaveng AT', 'Damen F', 'Celik I', 'Tane P', 'Kuete V', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.O.

RESULTS: Among the 5 patients, 2 had AML-M0, 2 had AML-M4, and 1 had CMM0L at the initial diagnosis. t(12;22)(p13;q12) was the primary abnormality among all patients. Rearrangements of MN1 gene were detected by FISH in all patients. MN1-ETV6 and ETV6-MN1 fusion genes were detected respectively in 4 and 3 patients.

We investigated the relationships between PTGS2 expression, celecoxib use during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and both event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 156 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative breast cancer from the REMAGUS02 (ISRCTN Registry No. 10059974) trial with pretreatment PTGS2 expression data. Patients were treated by sequential NAC (epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel with or without celecoxib). Experimental validation was performed on breast cancer cell lines. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 30801 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01041781) trial that tested chemotherapy with or without celecoxib in patients with lung cancer served as an independent validation cohort. RESULTS: After 94.5 months of follow-up, EFS was significantly lower in the celecoxib group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1 to 2.88; P = .046). A significant interaction between PTGS2 expression and celecoxib use was detected ( Pinteraction = .01). In the PTGS2-low group (n = 100), EFS was lower in the celecoxib arm (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.45 to 6.24; P = .002) than in the standard treatment arm. Celecoxib use was an independent predictor of poor EFS, distant relapse-free survival, and OS. Celecoxib in addition to docetaxel enhanced cell viability in PTGS2-low cell lines but not in PTGS2-high cell lines. In CALGB 30801, a trend toward poorer progression-free survival was observed in the patients with low urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E2 who received celecoxib (HR = 1.57; 95% CI, 0.87 to 2.84; P = .13). CONCLUSION: Celecoxib use during chemotherapy adversely affected survival in patients with breast cancer, and the effect was more marked in PTGS2-low and/or estrogen receptor-negative tumors. COX-2 inhibitors should preferably be avoided during docetaxel use in patients with breast cancer who are undergoing NAC.","['Hamy, Anne-Sophie', 'Tury, Sandrine', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Gao, Junheng', 'Pierga, Jean-Yves', 'Giacchetti, Sylvie', 'Brain, Etienne', 'Pistilli, Barbara', 'Marty, Michel', 'Espie, Marc', 'Benchimol, Gabriel', 'Laas, Enora', 'Lae, Marick', 'Asselain, Bernard', 'Aouchiche, Brice', 'Edelman, Martin', 'Reyal, Fabien']","['Hamy AS', 'Tury S', 'Wang X', 'Gao J', 'Pierga JY', 'Giacchetti S', 'Brain E', 'Pistilli B', 'Marty M', 'Espie M', 'Benchimol G', 'Laas E', 'Lae M', 'Asselain B', 'Aouchiche B', 'Edelman M', 'Reyal F']","['1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '2 Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Durham, NC.', '2 Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Durham, NC.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '3 Hopital Saint Louis (APHP), Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '4 Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', '3 Hopital Saint Louis (APHP), Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', '3 Hopital Saint Louis (APHP), Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', '5 Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA.', '1 Institut Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190131,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC6804843,,2019/02/01 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.00636 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Mar 10;37(8):624-635. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.00636.

Although AICAr could regulate cellular energy metabolism by activating AMPK, the cytotoxic mechanisms of AICAr are still unclear. Here, we knocked out TP53 or PRKAA1 gene (encoding AMPKalpha1) in NALM-6 and Reh cells by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 system and found that AICAr-induced proliferation inhibition was independent of AMPK activation but dependent on p53. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of nucleotide metabolites indicated that AICAr caused an increase in adenosine triphosphate, deoxyadenosine triphosphate, and deoxyguanosine triphosphate levels by up-regulating purine biosynthesis, while AICAr led to a decrease in cytidine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate, deoxycytidine triphosphate, and deoxythymidine triphosphate levels because of reduced phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate production, which consequently impaired the pyrimidine biosynthesis. Ribonucleoside triphosphate (NTP) pool imbalances suppressed the rRNA transcription efficiency. Furthermore, deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool imbalances induced DNA replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks, followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALL cells. Exogenous uridine could rebalance the NTP and dNTP pools by supplementing pyrimidine and then attenuate AICAr-induced cytotoxicity. Our data indicate that RNA transcription inhibition and DNA replication stress induced by NTP and dNTP pool imbalances might play a key role in AICAr-mediated cytotoxic effects on ALL cells, suggesting a potential clinical application of AICAr in future ALL therapy.-Du, L., Yang, F., Fang, H., Sun, H., Chen, Y., Xu, Y., Li, H., Zheng, L., Zhou, B.-B.

Despite the common inclusion of CNS prophylaxis treatments in therapy regimens, there are significant gaps in understanding the mechanisms that mediate leukemia cell entry into the CNS as well as roles for resident cells in the brain. In this study, we employ a xenograft model of human B cell precursor (BCP)-ALL in immunocompromised mice. This model system recapitulates key pathological characteristics of leptomeningeal involvement seen in patients and provides insights into rare cases that involve parenchymal invasion. We examine the infiltration of engrafted leukemia blasts into brains of recipient mice and provide evidence that the interaction between blasts and brain resident cells causes aberrant activation of host cells in the brain microenvironment. BCP-ALL blasts also release multiple cytokines and exosomes containing IL-15 that bind and are internalized by astrocytes and brain vessel endothelial cells. Leukemic invasion is linked to production of VEGF-AA by astrocytes and disruption of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity. Knockdown of either IL-15 or IL-15Ralpha in the NALM6 cell line decreases CNS infiltration in engrafted mice. These results provide important insights into the multiple mechanisms by which lymphoblasts modulate the brain microenvironment to breach the BBB for metastatic invasion.","['Kinjyo, Ichiko', 'Bragin, Denis', 'Grattan, Rachel', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Wilson, Bridget S']","['Kinjyo I', 'Bragin D', 'Grattan R', 'Winter SS', 'Wilson BS']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.', ""Blood Diseases and Cancer Program, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190131,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,PMC7200047,,2019/02/01 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.3A0218-054R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 Apr;105(4):741-753. doi: 10.1002/JLB.3A0218-054R.

However, its efficacy is still unclear. In this systematic review study, we aim to evaluate its efficacy and safety for ALL. METHODS: The following 9 databases will be searched from their inception to the present: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and four Chinese databases. The randomized controlled trials or case control studies of cyclophosphamide that assess the clinical efficacy and safety in patients with ALL are included. The methodological quality of all eligible included studies will be assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool.The primary outcome measurement will be all-cause mortality at the period of treatment and follow-up. The secondary outcome measurements will include the health-related quality of life (HRQL), postinduction complete remission (CR) rate, event-free survival (EFS), relapse rate, and adverse events. Two authors will independently select eligible studies, exact data, and assess the methodological quality of included studies. RevMan 5.3 software will be used to synthesize the data. Reporting bias will be evaluated by the funnel plots, Begg, and Egger tests. RESULTS: This systematic review will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of cyclophosphamide for ALL. DISSEMINATION AND ETHICS: The findings of this review will summarize the present evidence of cyclophosphamide for ALL, and may provide guidance for clinical practice of cyclophosphamide for ALL. Its results will be published through peer-reviewed journals. This study does not need ethic approval, because it will not involve the individual data.

We found that sinensetin significantly impeded Jurkat cell proliferation in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Additionally, sinensetin treatment triggered apoptosis and autophagy in Jurkat cells. The apoptosis induction was related to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and to increased caspase-3/-8/-9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Sinensetin also induced autophagy, as evidenced by the formation of acidic vacuoles, the upregulation of LC3-II and beclin-1, and the downregulation of p62. In addition, the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine significantly enhanced the apoptosis rate and improved the sensitivity of the Jurkat cells to sinensetin. Moreover, sinensetin induced cell death, apoptosis, and autophagy through the activation of the reactive oxygen species/ c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. In summary, our results revealed that sinensetin induced apoptosis and autophagy in human T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells by activating reactive oxygen species/ c-Jun N-terminal kinase and blocking the Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Thus, sinensetin might be a potential candidate in the development of antitumor drugs targeting T-cell leukemia.","['Tan, Kok-Tong', 'Lin, Meng-Xian', 'Lin, Shih-Chao', 'Tung, Yu-Tang', 'Lin, Sheng-Hao', 'Lin, Chi-Chien']","['Tan KT', 'Lin MX', 'Lin SC', 'Tung YT', 'Lin SH', 'Lin CC']","[""Department of Surgery, Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital."", 'Institute of Biomedical Science, National Chung-Hsing University.', ""Department of Surgery, Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital."", 'National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, Virginia, USA.', 'Graduate Institute of Metabolism and Obesity Sciences, Taipei Medical University, Taipei.', 'Division of Chest Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Science, National Chung-Hsing University.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000756 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2019 Jun;30(5):485-494. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000756.,,,,,,,,20200917,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '240LNZ51AT (sinensetin)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through in vitro growth inhibition studies, Western blot analysis for the expression and activation of key regulators of cell growth and survival and gene silencing studies, we specifically examined the ability of these agents to induce cytotoxicity through the activation of apoptosis and their capacity to interact and modulate the expression and phosphorylation of Aurora kinases. RESULTS: Our findings show that the various Plk-1 inhibitors in development show potential utility for the treatment of pediatric leukemia and exhibit a wide range of phosphorylation and target modulatory capabilities. Finally, we provide evidence for a complex interregulatory relationship between Plk-1 and Aurora kinases enabling the identification of synergy and biologic correlates of drug combinations targeting the 2 distinct enzyme systems. DISCUSSION: This information provide the rationale for the evaluation of Plk-1 as an effective target for therapeutics in refractory pediatric leukemia and indicate compensatory activities between Plk-1 and Aurora kinases, providing insight into some of the complex mechanisms involved in the process of cell division.","['Jayanthan, Aarthi', 'Hofmann, Bradley', 'Meier-Stephenson, Vanessa', 'Perinpanayagam, Maneka', 'Dunn, Sandra E', 'Boklan, Jessica', 'Trippett, Tanya M', 'Truong, Tony H', 'Narendran, Aru']","['Jayanthan A', 'Hofmann B', 'Meier-Stephenson V', 'Perinpanayagam M', 'Dunn SE', 'Boklan J', 'Trippett TM', 'Truong TH', 'Narendran A']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, and POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB."", 'Phoenix Molecular Designs, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, and POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, and POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, and POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB."", 'Phoenix Molecular Designs, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Childrens Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, and POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, and POETIC Laboratory for Preclinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2020/04/18 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001416 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Aug;41(6):e359-e370. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001416.,,,,,,,,20200417,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Aurora Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pteridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['0 (Azepines)', '0 (BI 6727)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MLN 8237)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pteridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In theoral fluid of patients with the initial signs of dental pathology in acute leukemia, a specific spectrum of disorders was established in the form of the lowest antibody level of immunoglobulin A class to transglutaminase in combination with a high amount of Ig G antibodies to transglutaminase - 8.73 +/- 0.92 U / ml, which maximal level exceeds the reference limits by almost 4 times (38.80 U / ml) - that indicates structural changes in the connective tissues of the oral cavity. Under the influence of chemotherapy in these patients, the inversion of clinical manifestations of dental pathology was noted: stomatitis II (medium) severity is formed, bypassing I degree, accompanied by a 4-fold increase of IgA antibodies to transglutaminase (4.03 +/- 0, 77 U / ml, p < 0.05) in the oral fluid of patients with acute leukemia and 2.5 times for chronic leukemias (3.24 +/- 0.47 U / ml, p < 0.05) compared to pre-treatment period. In this regard, it is recommended to determine the content in the oral fluid for antibodies to transglutaminase in patients with leukemia for verification of the degree of inflammatory-destructive process and its recovery. The peculiarity of immunological shifts in stomatitis of the 1st degree of severity is the highest level of IgG antibodies to transglutaminase (9.98 +/- 1.50 U / ml) in the oral fluid, and at II-III degree the molecular manifestations of damage are smoother, which indicates the depression of immune processes.","['Selezneva, I A', 'Svechnikova, M V', 'Gilmiyarov, E M', 'Gusyakova, O A', 'Gilmiyarova, F N', 'Kuznetsova, O Yu']","['Selezneva IA', 'Svechnikova MV', 'Gilmiyarov EM', 'Gusyakova OA', 'Gilmiyarova FN', 'Kuznetsova OY']","['Samara State Medical University, 43099, Samara, Russia.', 'Samara State Medical University, 43099, Samara, Russia.', 'Samara State Medical University, 43099, Samara, Russia.', 'Samara State Medical University, 43099, Samara, Russia.', 'Samara State Medical University, 43099, Samara, Russia.', 'Samara State Medical University, 43099, Samara, Russia.']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Klin Lab Diagn,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,9432021,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2019/02/01 06:00,2019/07/19 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18821/0869-2084-2018-63-6-349-352 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Lab Diagn. 2018;63(6):349-352. doi: 10.18821/0869-2084-2018-63-6-349-352.,['NOTNLM'],"['IgA antibodies to transglutaminase and gliadin', 'IgG antibodies to transglutaminase and gliadin', 'acute and chronic leukemia', 'oral fluid', 'stomatitis']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6647-5330', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4761-4379', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5619-4583', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5992-3609', 'ORCID: 00000-0001-5992-3609']",,,20190718,IM,"['Autoantibodies/blood', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mouth Mucosa/*pathology', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Transglutaminases/immunology']","['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This recommendation is partly due to the severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia from which many patients suffer. The inability to perform activities of daily living restricts them, diminishes their quality of life and can influence medical therapy. OBJECTIVES: In this update of the original review (published in 2014) our main objective was to re-evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of aerobic physical exercise for adults suffering from haematological malignancies considering the current state of knowledge. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2018, Issue 7) and MEDLINE (1950 to July 2018) trials registries (ISRCTN, EU clinical trials register and clinicaltrials.gov) and conference proceedings. We did not apply any language restrictions. Two review authors independently screened search results, disagreements were solved by discussion. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an aerobic physical exercise intervention, intending to improve the oxygen system, in addition to standard care with standard care only for adults suffering from haematological malignancies. We also included studies that evaluated aerobic exercise in addition to strength training. We excluded studies that investigated the effect of training programmes that were composed of yoga, tai chi chuan, qigong or similar types of exercise. We also excluded studies exploring the influence of strength training without additive aerobic exercise as well as studies assessing outcomes without any clinical impact. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events, mortality and 100-day survival, standardised mean differences (SMD) for quality of life (QoL), fatigue, and physical performance, and mean differences (MD) for anthropometric measurements. MAIN RESULTS: In this update, nine trials could be added to the nine trials of the first version of the review, thus we included eighteen RCTs involving 1892 participants. Two of these studies (65 participants) did not provide data for our key outcomes (they analysed laboratory values only) and one study (40 patients) could not be included in the meta-analyses, as results were presented as changes scores only and not as endpoint scores. One trial (17 patients) did not report standard errors and could also not be included in meta-analyses. The overall potential risk of bias in the included trials is unclear, due to poor reporting.The majority of participants suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma, and eight trials randomised people receiving stem cell transplantation. Mostly, the exercise intervention consisted of various walking intervention programmes with different duration and intensity levels.Our primary endpoint overall survival (OS) was only reported in one of these studies. The study authors found no evidence for a difference between both arms (RR = 0.67; P = 0.112). Six trials (one trial with four arms, analysed as two sub-studies) reported numbers of deceased participants during the course of the study or during the first 100 to 180 days. For the outcome mortality, there is no evidence for a difference between participants exercising and those in the control group (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.52; P = 0.59; 1172 participants, low-certainty evidence).For the following outcomes, higher numbers indicate better outcomes, with 1 being the best result for the standardised mean differences. Eight studies analysed the influence of exercise intervention on QoL. It remains unclear, whether physical exercise improves QoL (SMD 0.11; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.24; 1259 participants, low-certainty evidence). There is also no evidence for a difference for the subscales physical functioning (SMD 0.15; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.32; 8 trials, 1329 participants, low-certainty evidence) and anxiety (SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.36; 6 trials, 445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Depression might slightly be improved by exercising (SMD 0.19; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.38; 6 trials, 445 participants, low-certainty evidence). There is moderate-certainty evidence that exercise probably improves fatigue (SMD 0.31; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.48; 9 trials, 826 patients).Six trials (435 participants) investigated serious adverse events. We are very uncertain, whether additional exercise leads to more serious adverse events (RR 1.39; 95% CI 0.94 to 2.06), based on very low-certainty evidence.In addition, we are aware of four ongoing trials. However, none of these trials stated, how many patients they will recruit and when the studies will be completed, thus, potential influence of these trials for the current analyses remains unclear. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Eighteen, mostly small RCTs did not identify evidence for a difference in terms of mortality. Physical exercise added to standard care might improve fatigue and depression. Currently, there is inconclusive evidence regarding QoL, physical functioning, anxiety and SAEs .We need further trials with more participants and longer follow-up periods to evaluate the effects of exercise intervention for people suffering from haematological malignancies. To enhance comparability of study data, development and implementation of core sets of measuring devices would be helpful.","['Knips, Linus', 'Bergenthal, Nils', 'Streckmann, Fiona', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Knips L', 'Bergenthal N', 'Streckmann F', 'Monsef I', 'Elter T', 'Skoetz N']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20190131,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,PMC6354325,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009075.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019 Jan 31;1:CD009075. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009075.pub3.,,,,,,,,20190410,IM,"['Adult', '*Exercise', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/mortality/*rehabilitation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Physical Conditioning, Human', 'Qigong', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Resistance Training', 'Tai Ji', 'Yoga']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Nov 11;(11):CD009075.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL aged from 0 to 18 years who received treatment with nelarabine as a part of the therapeutic element R6 were included in the study. For all patients a detailed immunological analysis of leukemia cells with discrimination of immunological variants TI, TII, TIII or TIV was performed. Patients administered with nelarabine as a first therapeutic element were referred to the first-line therapy group, other patients were referred to the second-line therapy group. Nelarabine was ad- ministered as intravenous infusion at a dose of 650 mg/m2, on days 1-5. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (allo-HSCT) was considered for all patients. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2017, 54 patients with refractory/relapsed T-ALL were treated with nelarabine. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was 28% for all patients, cumulative risk of relapse (CIR) was 27%. EFS was significantly higher in nelarabine first-line therapy group in comparison with second-line therapy group (34+/-8% vs 8+/-8%, p=0,05). In patients after allo-HSCT EFS, OS and CIR were 51+/-10%, 50+/-10% and 39,1+/-9,5% accordingly. The best results were achieved in patients with TI immunophenotype. No toxicity-related mortality as well as severe neurologic complications or discontinuation of therapy associated with use of nelarabine were reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 115 adult patients with firstly diagnosed Ph-negative ALL: 58 male and 57 female aged from 15 to 61 years (mean age 26.5 years), who underwent treatment from September 2009 to September 2015 in National Medical Research Center for Hematology MH RF (n=101) and in hematology departments of regional hospitals (n=14). All patients received therapy of ALL-2009 protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01193933). The median follow-up was 24.5 months (0.2-94.4 months). As a part of the study results of a standard cytogenetic assay (SCA) were analyzed and fluorescence hybridization in situ (FISH) with the use of DNA-probes was performed on archived biological material for structural changes in gene locuses MLL/t(11q23), small es, Cyrillic-MYC/t(8q24), TP53/ deletion 17p13, CDKN2A/ deletion 9p21, translocation t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 small i, Cyrillic t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1; iAMP21 identification. RESULTS: Karyotype was defined using SCA in 86% of patients. Normal karyotype was found in 48.5% of them, chromosome aberrations in 51.5% (structural changes were found in 19.2%, hyperploidy in 27.2%, and hypoploidy in 5.1%). In 17.2% of patients complex karyotype abnormalities were found. With the use of FISH technique aberrations were found in 67% of patients: 9p21/CDKN2A deletion in 24.3%, MLL/t(11q23) gene abnormalities in 7.8%, 17p13/TP53 deletion in 5.2%, abnormalities of c-MYC/t(8q24) in 1.7%, t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 in 0.8%, and iAMP21 in 0.8%, other abnormalities (additional signals/absence of signals from gene locuses) in 26.4%, t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1 was not found. FISH technique use in addition to SCA allows to increase aberrant karyotype location from 51.5 to 67%. A statistically significant correlation of 9p21/CDKN2A deletion with high serum lactate dehydrogenase activity (p=0.02); MLL/t(11q23) gene abnormalities - with leucocytosis and high blast cells level in blood (p=0.0016), hyperploidy - with normal leukocyte count (p=0.02) was shown. In groups with different cytogenetic abnormalities no statistically significant differences of treatment with ALL-2009 protocol were found (in terms of complete remission, early mortality and treatment resistance). When connection of cytogenetic abnormalities and their combinations with long-term results were analyzed according to ALL-2009 protocol, only two characteristics - MLL/t(11q23) and c MYC/t(8q24) gene abnormalities had a statistically significant influence on disease-free survival (HR - 176.9; p&lt;0.0001) and chance of recurrence (HR - 6.4; p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Adverse prognostic factors in terms of therapeutic management provided in ALL-2009 protocol were MLL/t(11q23) and small es, Cyrillic-MYC/t(8q24) genes abnormalities. CDKN2A/9p21 and TP53/17p13 genes deletions, quantative and complex karyotype abnormalities were not prognostic factors in adult patients with Ph-negative ALL in ALL-2009 protocol use.","['Piskunova, I S', 'Obukhova, T N', 'Parovichnikova, E N', 'Kulikov, S M', 'Troitskaya, V V', 'Gavrilina, O A', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Piskunova IS', 'Obukhova TN', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Kulikov SM', 'Troitskaya VV', 'Gavrilina OA', 'Savchenko VG']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26442/terarkh201890730-37 [doi]'],ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2018 Aug 17;90(7):30-37. doi: 10.26442/terarkh201890730-37.,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL-2009 protocol', 'FISH', 'Ph-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chromosome aberrations', 'risk factors']",,,,,,20190403,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Young Adult']",,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01193933'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inductive and consolidation program for 139 (80%) patients was based on a standardized protocol: 4 courses ""7+3"" with different anthracycline use (2 courses of daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) and continuous use of cytarabine on the second inductive course. In 20% of patients cytarabine courses at the dose of 1 g/m2 2 times a day for 1-3 days combined with idarubicin and mitoxantrone were used as two consolidation courses. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation was performed in the first complete remission (CR) period in 40% of patients. RESULTS: The frequency of CR achievement in all patients was 78.6%, refractory forms were observed in 13.9% of patients, early mortality - in 7.5% of patients. Seven-year overall survival (OS) rate was 40.7%, relapse free survival (RFS) - 43.2%. When estimating effectiveness depending on cytogenetic risk group it was demonstrated that 5-year OS and RFS in patients with translocation (8; 21) cannot be considered as satisfying, it accounted for 50 and 34%, respectively. At the same time in patients with 16th chromosome inversion (inv16) these characteristics accounted for 68.6 and 63.5%. Acquired results forced reconsidering of the consolidation program in AML patients of this subgroup. The median time to allogenic blood stem cells transplantation (allo-BSCT) in patients with first CR was 6.5 months that was taken as a reference point in landmark analysis of patients in whom allo-BSCT was not performed. Landmark analysis showed that in AML patients of favorable prognosis group allo-BSCT does not significantly reduce the probability of relapse (0 and 36%) and does not influence RFS (33 and 64%). In patients of border-line and poor prognosis allo-BSCT significantly reduces relapse probability (26 and 66%; 20 and 100%) and significantly increases a 7-year RFS (68.7 and 30%; 45.6 and 0%). Allo-BSCT also results in significant RFS increase and reduces the probability of relapse (25 small i, Cyrillic 78%) in patients in whom CR was achieved only after the second induction course. At the same time allo-BSCT does not influence patients who achieved CR after the first treatment course: 55 and 50%. CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis showed that cytogenetic risk group (HR=2.3), time of CR achievement (HR=2.9), and allo-BSCT transplantation (HR=0.16) are independent factors for disease relapse prognosis after achieving CR.","['Parovichnikova, E N', 'Loukianova, I A', 'Troitskaya, V V', 'Drokov, M Y', 'Lobaova, T I', 'Kuzmina, L A', 'Sokolov, A N', 'Kokhno, A V', 'Fidarova, Z T', 'Baskhaeva, G A', 'Gavrilina, O A', 'Vasilyeva, V A', 'Obukhova, T N', 'Kuznetsova, S A', 'Sudarikov, A B', 'Dvirnik, V N', 'Galtseva, I V', 'Davidiva, J O', 'Kulikov, S M', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Parovichnikova EN', 'Loukianova IA', 'Troitskaya VV', 'Drokov MY', 'Lobaova TI', 'Kuzmina LA', 'Sokolov AN', 'Kokhno AV', 'Fidarova ZT', 'Baskhaeva GA', 'Gavrilina OA', 'Vasilyeva VA', 'Obukhova TN', 'Kuznetsova SA', 'Sudarikov AB', 'Dvirnik VN', 'Galtseva IV', 'Davidiva JO', 'Kulikov SM', 'Savchenko VG']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26442/terarkh201890714-22 [doi]'],ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2018 Aug 17;90(7):14-22. doi: 10.26442/terarkh201890714-22.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogenic blood stem cells transplantation', 'risk group']",,,,,,20190403,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*methods/mortality', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Russia', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, evaluation of the performance of these methods is not readily available for practitioners yet. We provide a tutorial for evaluating classification accuracy for various state-of-the-art learning approaches, including familiar shallow and deep learning methods. For qualitative response variables with more than two categories, many traditional accuracy measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are not applicable and we have to consider their extensions properly. In this paper, a few important statistical concepts for multicategory classification accuracy are reviewed and their utilities for various learning algorithms are demonstrated with real medical examples. We offer problem-based R code to illustrate how to perform these statistical computations step by step. We expect that such analysis tools will become more familiar to practitioners and receive broader applications in biostatistics.","['Li, Jialiang', 'Gao, Ming', ""D'Agostino, Ralph""]","['Li J', 'Gao M', ""D'Agostino R""]","['Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Duke University-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore.', 'Department of Mathematics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.8103 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2019 Jun 15;38(13):2477-2503. doi: 10.1002/sim.8103.

Drug efflux inhibition was investigated in the microfluidic chip using two different fluorescence detection systems, namely, a compact single-cell bioanalyzer and the conventional optical detection system constructed from an inverted microscope and a microphotometer. More importantly, a compact signal generator was used to conduct dielectrophoretic cell trapping together with the compact SCB. By using the DEP force, a single acute myeloid leukemia cell was trapped in the cell retention structure of the chip. This allowed us to detect dye accumulation in the MDR leukemic cells in the presence of cyclosporine A (CsA). CsA and rhodamine 123 were used as the P-glycoprotein inhibitor and fluorescent dye, respectively. The result showed that the Rh123 fluorescence signal in a single-cell increased dramatically over its same-cell control on both fluorescence detection systems due to the inhibition by CsA.","['Sharifi Noghabi, Hamideh', 'Soo, Mandy', 'Khamenehfar, Avid', 'Li, Paul C H']","['Sharifi Noghabi H', 'Soo M', 'Khamenehfar A', 'Li PCH']","['Department of chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190205,Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/elps.201800451 [doi]'],ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2019 May;40(10):1478-1485. doi: 10.1002/elps.201800451.

Double positive (NPM1+/FLT3+) cases accounted for 20% of NK patients. CEBPA and c-kit mutations were detected in 7.3% and 2.4% respectively. In the ALL cohort, the mean age was 37 years. B- and T-lymphoblastic leukemia constituted 84.6% and 15.4% of ALL cases and the M:F ratio was 1.2:1 and 2.86:1 respectively. B-ALL patients were positive for t(9;22) in 14.2%, t(4;11) in 5.4%, t(1;19) in 2.7% and t(12;21) in 1.4%. T-ALL patients were negative for translocations found in our ALL panel. A lower mean age was found in our adult leukemic Lebanese population as compared to the Western cases. Other interesting findings were the lower percentage of inv(16), lower incidence of TCF3-PBX1, and the mild increase in Philadelphia positivity in our AML cohort. In our ALL cohort, t(9;22) positivity was less than expected for adult lymphoblastic leukemia. Full molecular profiling by next generation sequencing is required for further classification of cases into prognostic categories. This study will be a baseline reference for future research and epidemiological data useful for transplant centers and oncologists both in Lebanon and the region.","['Assaf, Nada', 'El-Cheikh, Jean', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Salem, Ziad', 'Farra, Chantal', 'Chakhachiro, Zaher', 'Nassif, Samer', 'Zaatari, Ghazi', 'Mahfouz, Rami']","['Assaf N', 'El-Cheikh J', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Salem Z', 'Farra C', 'Chakhachiro Z', 'Nassif S', 'Zaatari G', 'Mahfouz R']","['Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, PO BOX 11-0236, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Basile Cancer Center, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Basile Cancer Center, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Basile Cancer Center, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, PO BOX 11-0236, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, PO BOX 11-0236, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, PO BOX 11-0236, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, PO BOX 11-0236, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, PO BOX 11-0236, Beirut, Lebanon. rm11@aub.edu.lb.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190130,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-019-04649-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-019-04649-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2019 Apr;46(2):2003-2011. doi: 10.1007/s11033-019-04649-2.

Inflammation is often a contributing factor to the development and progression of AML, and related diseases, and can potentiate therapy failure. Previously, we had identified anti-inflammatory roles and anti-AML efficacy for blueberry extracts. The present study extended these observations to determine that the polyphenol quercetin inhibited neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) activity and exerted anti-AML efficacy. Moreover, quercetin was shown to exert combinatorial anti-AML efficacy with nanoliposomal ceramide. Overall, this demonstrated that quercetin could block the pro-inflammatory actions of N-SMase and augment the efficacy of anti-AML therapeutics, including ceramide-based therapeutics.","['McGill, Colin M', 'Brown, Timothy J', 'Fisher, Lindsey N', 'Gustafson, Sally J', 'Dunlap, Kriya L', 'Beck, Adam J', 'Toran, Paul T', 'Claxton, David F', 'Barth, Brian M']","['McGill CM', 'Brown TJ', 'Fisher LN', 'Gustafson SJ', 'Dunlap KL', 'Beck AJ', 'Toran PT', 'Claxton DF', 'Barth BM']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Alaska-Anchorage, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Alaska-Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Alaska-Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775.', 'Drug Discovery, Development, and Delivery Core, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180131,United States,Int J Biopharm Sci,International journal of biopharmaceutical sciences,101716760,PMC6349237,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/02/01 06:01,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.31021/ijbs.20181106 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Biopharm Sci. 2018;1(1). doi: 10.31021/ijbs.20181106.

While chromosomal regions associate with nucleolar ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA), the biological significance of rDNA-genome interactions and whether they are dynamically regulated during disease remain unclear. rDNA chromatin exists in multiple inactive and active states and their transition is regulated by the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBTF. Here, using a MYC-driven lymphoma model, we demonstrate that during malignant progression the rDNA chromatin converts to the open state, which is required for tumor cell survival. Moreover, this rDNA transition co-occurs with a reorganization of rDNA-genome contacts which correlate with gene expression changes at associated loci, impacting gene ontologies including B-cell differentiation, cell growth and metabolism. We propose that UBTF-mediated conversion to open rDNA chromatin during malignant transformation contributes to the regulation of specific gene pathways that regulate growth and differentiation through reformed long-range physical interactions with the rDNA.","['Diesch, Jeannine', 'Bywater, Megan J', 'Sanij, Elaine', 'Cameron, Donald P', 'Schierding, William', 'Brajanovski, Natalie', 'Son, Jinbae',

Venetoclax (ABT-199) targets BCL-2 and has shown promising efficacy in AML but over-expression of MCL-1 can cause resistance. A co-operative approach, targeting both BCL-2 and MCL-1 may therefore prove beneficial. This study investigated the potential synergistic relationship between Venetoclax and the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 in AML cells. We treated MV4-11 cells and primary AML samples for 4 hours with Venetoclax, S63845 or the combination. We used a short-term flow cytometric technique to assess synergy using cytochrome C release as a read out of response. The combination of Venetoclax and S63845 produced a synergistic apoptotic response in MV4-11 cells and primary samples, including the leukaemia re-populating leukaemic stem cell (LSC) population, in 92% of the samples. Known molecular biomarkers of response to BCL-2 and MCL-1 targeting agents were corroborated, and augmented, with the short-term functional assay. The assay also predicted potential biomarkers of response to the combination of BCL-2 and MCL-1 targeting agents. Primary samples with an IDH2_140 mutation were more sensitive to Venetoclax as a single agent whereas samples with a FLT3-ITD mutation were more resistant. This resistance could be reversed when combined with S63845. All FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutated samples were sensitive to the combination of drugs. We report that co-operatively targeting BCL-2 and MCL-1 may be beneficial in AML and a short-term in vitro assay can identify patients who might best respond to this combination.","['Grundy, Martin', 'Balakrishnan, Sahana', 'Fox, Matthew', 'Seedhouse, Claire H', 'Russell, Nigel H']","['Grundy M', 'Balakrishnan S', 'Fox M', 'Seedhouse CH', 'Russell NH']","['Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181228,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6340871,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],2019/02/01 06:00,2019/02/01 06:01,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26540 [doi]', '26540 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Dec 28;9(102):37777-37789. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26540. eCollection 2018 Dec 28.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BCL-2', 'MCL-1', 'S63845', 'Venetoclax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that in cell growth inhibition assays, MCL and T-ALL cell lines exhibited increased sensitivity to ON108110 when compared to other tumor types. Treatment with ON108110 reduced the level of phosphorylated RB-family proteins. In addition, ON108110 treatment resulted in concentration dependent inhibition of PTEN phosphorylation and a concomitant decrease in PI3K-AKT signaling mediated by CK2. Accordingly, cells treated with ON108110 rapidly accumulated in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle as a function of increasing concentration followed by rapid onset of apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that dual inhibition of CK2 and CDK4/6 may be an efficient treatment of MCL and T-ALLs displaying upregulation of CK2/PI3K and CDK4 signaling pathways.","['Padgaonkar, Amol', 'Rechkoblit, Olga', 'Vasquez-Del Carpio, Rodgrigo', 'Pallela, Venkat', 'Venkata Subbaiah, Drc', 'Cosenza, Stephen C', 'Baker, Stacey J', 'Ramana Reddy, M V', 'Aggarwal, Aneel', 'Reddy, E Premkumar']","['Padgaonkar A', 'Rechkoblit O', 'Vasquez-Del Carpio R', 'Pallela V', 'Venkata Subbaiah D', 'Cosenza SC', 'Baker SJ', 'Ramana Reddy MV', 'Aggarwal A', 'Reddy EP']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Present Address: Prescient Healthcare Group, Jersey City 07302, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Present address: Sandoz, a Novartis Company, Miami 33126, FL, USA.', 'Present address: Pfizer, Collegeville 19426, PA, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Present address: Carnegie Pharmaceuticals, Monmouth Junction 08852, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, New York 10029, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181228,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6340882,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST EPR is an equity holder, board member and a paid consultant', 'of Onconova Therapeutics, Inc.

Thrombocytopenia due to hematological disease is one cause of hemoptysis. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic malignancy characterized by both a myeloproliferative neoplasm and a myelodysplastic syndrome. This malignancy often infiltrates various extramedullary organs and has a poor prognosis. An 84-year-old Japanese man with CMML was suffered from hemoptysis and dyspnea. When he arrived at the emergency room, hemoptysis stopped. His white blood cell count was 866 x 10(9)/L with 3.5% blast cells and 36.5% monocytes; hemoglobin was 6.7 g/dL; platelets count was 19 x 10(9)/L; and C-reactive protein was 16.23 mg/dL. Chest X-ray examination revealed an invasion shadow near the mediastinum in the left upper lung field. Chest computed tomography revealed a tumorous lesion in the left upper lobe, which had progressed to the mediastinum and formed an infiltration shadow around it. He was administered the antibiotics and the hemostatic agents under hospitalization. He also received blood transfusion for anemia and thrombocytopenia. Rapid improvement in oxygenation was observed along with a rapid decrease in blood levels in the sputum. On the eighth days of hospitalization, however, the patient newly developed massive hemoptysis and died. Autopsy revealed rupture of a thoracic pseudoaneurysm due to infiltration of leukemia cells in the tunica media and lung. Clinicians should consider thoracic aortic aneurysms as a possible cause of hemoptysis even in cases with small hemoptysis. It should be noted that in CMML patients, direct infiltration of leukemia cells in the vascular wall can cause aneurysm formation.","['Tanaka, Hiroaki', 'Yano, Mizuki', 'Kuwabara, Chihiro', 'Kume, Ayaka', 'Tamura, Yuri', 'Murakami, Miki', 'Shimizu, Ryo', 'Saito, Haruhisa', 'Suzuki, Yoshio']","['Tanaka H', 'Yano M', 'Kuwabara C', 'Kume A', 'Tamura Y', 'Murakami M', 'Shimizu R', 'Saito H', 'Suzuki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Asahi General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190105,Canada,J Clin Med Res,Journal of clinical medicine research,101538301,PMC6340676,['All the authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2019/02/01 06:00,2019/02/01 06:01,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.14740/jocmr3712 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Med Res. 2019 Feb;11(2):145-150. doi: 10.14740/jocmr3712.

This study compared the responses to and survival of 347 POEMS syndrome patients given three first-line treatment regimens: autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT, N = 165) and melphalan + dexamethasone (MDex, N = 79), or lenalidomide + dexamethasone (LDex, N = 103). After a median 45-month follow-up, overall hematologic complete remission (CRH) was 46.4%, vascular endothelial growth factor complete remission (CRV) was 55.1%, and neurological remission (RN) was 93.8%. CRH was better with ASCT (49.7%) than with MDex (37.7%, p = 0.001). CRV was better with ASCT (66.2%) than with MDex (38.5%, p = 0.001) or LDex (47.7%, p = 0.008). Differences in RN achieved by three regimens (91.5% vs. 100% vs. 93.8%, p = 0.234) were not significant. Overall 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 80.5% and overall 3-year overall survival (OS) was 90.8%. PFS was 87.6% with ASCT and 64.9% with LDex (p = 0.003). OS in the three regimens did not differ (p = 0.079). In medium-high risk patients, ASCT had better CRH and CRV than MDex, and better PFS than LDex. Therefore, although all three treatments had reasonable responses and survivals, patients with higher risk may benefit more from ASCT treatment.","['Zhao, Hao', 'Huang, Xu-Fei', 'Gao, Xue-Min', 'Cai, Hao', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Feng, Jun', 'Cao, Xin-Xin', 'Zhou, Dao-Bin', 'Li, Jian']","['Zhao H', 'Huang XF', 'Gao XM', 'Cai H', 'Zhang L', 'Feng J', 'Cao XX', 'Zhou DB', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China. lijian@pumch.cn.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6756085,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0391-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0391-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Apr;33(4):1023-1029. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0391-2.

Here, we used a high-throughput version of the assay (HT-STELA) to establish whether telomere length could predict for outcome to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR)-based treatment using samples collected from two concurrent phase II studies, ARCTIC and ADMIRE (n = 260). In univariate analysis, patients with TL-IFR had reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.0001; HR = 2.17) and shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0002; HR = 2.44). Bifurcation of the IGHV-mutated and unmutated subsets according to telomere length revealed that patients with TL-IFR in each subset had shorter PFS (HR = 4.35 and HR = 1.48, respectively) and shorter OS (HR = 3.81 and HR = 2.18, respectively). In addition, the OS of the TL-OFR and TL-IFR subsets were not significantly altered by IGHV mutation status (P = 0.61; HR = 1.24 and P = 0.41; HR = 1.47, respectively). In multivariate modeling, telomere length was the dominant co-variable for PFS (P = 0.0002; HR = 1.85) and OS (P = 0.05; HR = 1.61). Taken together, our data suggest that HT-STELA is a powerful predictor of outcome to FCR-based treatment and could be used to inform the design of future risk-adapted clinical trials.","['Norris, Kevin', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Rawstron, Andrew', 'Hills, Robert', 'Baird, Duncan M', 'Fegan, Christopher D', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Norris K', 'Hillmen P', 'Rawstron A', 'Hills R', 'Baird DM', 'Fegan CD', 'Pepper C']","['Division of Cancer & Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford, OX3 7LF, USA.', 'Division of Cancer & Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer & Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer & Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK. c.pepper@bsms.ac.uk.', 'University of Sussex, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK. c.pepper@bsms.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6756045,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0389-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0389-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):1953-1963. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0389-9.

The recognition that Mcl-1, a major component of the anti-apoptotic response, is intrinsically short-lived and must be continually resynthesized suggested a novel therapeutic approach. Pateamine A (PatA), a macrolide marine natural product, inhibits cap-dependent translation by binding to the initiation factor eIF4A. In this study, we demonstrated that a synthetic derivative of PatA, des-methyl des-amino PatA (DMDAPatA), blocked mRNA translation, reduced Mcl-1 protein and initiated apoptosis in CLL cells. This action was synergistic with the Bcl-2 antagonist ABT-199. However, avid binding to human plasma proteins limited DMDAPatA potency, precluding further development. To address this, we synthesized a new series of PatA analogs and identified three new leads with potent inhibition of translation. They exhibited less plasma protein binding and increased cytotoxic potency toward CLL cells than DMDAPatA, with greater selectivity towards CLL cells over normal lymphocytes. Computer modeling analysis correlated their structure-activity relationships and suggested that these compounds may act by stabilizing the closed conformation of eIF4A. Thus, these novel PatA analogs hold promise for application to cancers within the appropriate biological context, such as CLL.","['Chen, Rong', 'Zhu, Mingzhao', 'Chaudhari, Rajan R', 'Robles, Omar', 'Chen, Yuling', 'Skillern, Wesley', 'Qin, Qun', 'Wierda, William G', 'Zhang, Shuxing', 'Hull, Kenneth G', 'Romo, Daniel', 'Plunkett, William']","['Chen R', 'Zhu M', 'Chaudhari RR', 'Robles O', 'Chen Y', 'Skillern W', 'Qin Q', 'Wierda WG', 'Zhang S', 'Hull KG', 'Romo D', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry & CPRIT Synthesis & Drug-Lead Discovery Laboratory, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Natural Products LINCHPIN Laboratory, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Natural Products LINCHPIN Laboratory, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry & CPRIT Synthesis & Drug-Lead Discovery Laboratory, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Natural Products LINCHPIN Laboratory, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry & CPRIT Synthesis & Drug-Lead Discovery Laboratory, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA.

BAKs are critical signaling transducers of BCR signaling and seem relevant in B cell lymphoma pathogenesis. The functional relevance of BTK for lymphoid malignancies is strongly supported by the observation that resistance to therapy in CLL patients treated with BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib is often associated with mutations in genes coding for BTK or Phospholipase-C gamma (PLC). In some contrast, next generation sequencing data show that BAKs are mutated at very low frequency in treatment-naive B cell lymphomas. Therefore, it remains debatable whether BAKs are essential drivers for lymphoma development. In addition, results obtained by targeted deletion of BAKs such as Lyn and Btk in murine CLL models suggest that BAKs may be essential to shape the dialogue between malignant B cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Since BAKs are expressed in multiple cell types, BAK inhibitors may disrupt the lymphoma supportive microenvironment. This concept also explains the typical response to BAK inhibitor treatment, characterized by a long-lasting increase of peripheral blood lymphoid cells, due to a redistribution from the lymphoid homing compartments. In addition, BAK inhibitors have shown some efficacy in solid tumors, probably through mediator cells in the TME. This review summarizes and validates the evidence for BAK inhibitors being part of a class of agents that modulate the (hematopoietic) microenvironment of cancers.","['Nguyen, Phuong-Hien', 'Niesen, Emanuel', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Nguyen PH', 'Niesen E', 'Hallek M']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne; Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn; CECAD Center of Excellence on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases; Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, 50931, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne; Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn; CECAD Center of Excellence on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases; Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, 50931, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne; Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn; CECAD Center of Excellence on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases; Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, 50931, Cologne, Germany. michael.hallek@uni-koeln.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190130,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0366-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0366-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Mar;33(3):576-587. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0366-8.

While it has been shown that TAL1/LMO transcription factors induce self-renewal of thymocytes, whether this is true for other transcription factor oncogenes is unknown. To address this, we have studied NUP98-HOXD13-transgenic (NHD13-Tg) mice, which overexpress HOXA transcription factors throughout haematopoiesis and develop both myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progressing to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as well as T-ALL. We find that thymocytes from preleukaemic NHD13-Tg mice can serially transplant, demonstrating that they have self-renewal capacity. Transcriptome analysis shows that NHD13-Tg thymocytes exhibit a stem cell-like transcriptional programme closely resembling that induced by Lmo2, including Lmo2 itself and its critical cofactor Lyl1. To determine whether Lmo2/Lyl1 are required for NHD13-induced thymocyte self-renewal, NHD13-Tg mice were crossed with Lyl1 knockout mice. This showed that Lyl1 is essential for expression of the stem cell-like gene expression programme in thymocytes and self-renewal. Surprisingly however, NHD13 transgenic mice lacking Lyl1 showed accelerated T-ALL and absence of transformation to AML, associated with a loss of multipotent progenitors in the bone marrow. Thus multiple T cell oncogenes induce thymocyte self-renewal via Lmo2/Lyl1; however, NHD13 can also promote T-ALL via an alternative pathway.","['Shields, Benjamin J', 'Slape, Christopher I', 'Vo, Ngoc', 'Jackson, Jacob T', 'Pliego-Zamora, Adriana', 'Ranasinghe, Hansini', 'Shi, Wei', 'Curtis, David J', 'McCormack, Matthew P']","['Shields BJ', 'Slape CI', 'Vo N', 'Jackson JT', 'Pliego-Zamora A', 'Ranasinghe H', 'Shi W', 'Curtis DJ', 'McCormack MP']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'University of Queensland, Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'University of Queensland, Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, VIC, Australia.', 'University of Queensland, Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3010, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. matthew.mccormack@monash.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0361-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0361-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):1868-1880. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0361-0.

Accumulating studies have indicated that the regeneration of normal HSCs and the process of leukemogenesis change with advancing age. However, the role of microenvironmental factors in these age-related effects are unclear. Here, we compared the stem cell niche in neonatal and adult BM to investigate potential differences in their microenvironmental regulation of both normal and leukemic stem cells. We found that the mesenchymal niche in neonatal BM, compared to adult BM, was characterized by a higher frequency of primitive subsets of mesenchymal stroma expressing both platelet-derived growth factor receptor and Sca-1, and higher expression levels of the niche cross-talk molecules, Jagged-1 and CXCL-12. Accordingly, normal HSCs transplanted into neonatal mice exhibited higher levels of regeneration in BM, with no difference in homing efficiency or splenic engraftment compared to adult BM. In contrast, in vivo self-renewal of LSCs was higher in adult BM than in neonatal BM, with increased frequencies of leukemia-initiating cells as well as higher lympho-myeloid differentiation potential towards biphenotypic leukemic cells. These differences in LSC self-renewal capacity between neonates and adults was abrogated by switching of recipients, confirming their microenvironmental origin. Our study provides insight into the differences in leukemic diseases observed in childhood and adults, and is important for interpretation of many transplantation studies involving neonatal animal models.","['Lee, Ga-Young', 'Jeong, Seon-Yeong', 'Lee, Hae-Ri', 'Oh, Il-Hoan']","['Lee GY', 'Jeong SY', 'Lee HR', 'Oh IH']","['Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center and Department of Medical Lifescience, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 137-701, Korea.', 'Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center and Department of Medical Lifescience, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 137-701, Korea.', 'Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center and Department of Medical Lifescience, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 137-701, Korea.', 'Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center and Department of Medical Lifescience, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 137-701, Korea. iho@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Department of Medical Lifescience, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 137-701, Korea. iho@catholic.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6353913,,2019/02/01 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-36999-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-36999-5 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jan 30;9(1):1007. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-36999-5.,,,,,,,,20200511,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Stem Cell Niche', '*Tumor Microenvironment']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that MHC II cell-autonomously regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in B-cell precursors, as well as in malignant B cells. Initiation of MHC II expression early during bone marrow B-cell development limited the occupancy of cycling compartments by promoting differentiation, thus regulating the numerical output of B cells. MHC II deficiency preserved stem cell characteristics in developing pro-B cells in vivo, and ectopic MHC II expression accelerated hematopoietic stem cell differentiation in vitro. Moreover, MHC II expression restrained growth of murine B-cell leukemia cell lines in vitro and in vivo, independently of CD4(+) T-cell surveillance. Our results highlight an important cell-intrinsic contribution of MHC II expression to establishing the differentiated B-cell phenotype.","['Merkenschlager, Julia', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Danelli, Luca', 'Attig, Jan', 'Young, George R', 'Nowosad, Carla', 'Tolar, Pavel', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Merkenschlager J', 'Eksmond U', 'Danelli L', 'Attig J', 'Young GR', 'Nowosad C', 'Tolar P', 'Kassiotis G']","['Retroviral Immunology.', 'Retroviral Immunology.', 'Retroviral Immunology.', 'Retroviral Immunology.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions, and.', 'Immune Receptor Activation Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Immune Receptor Activation Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Retroviral Immunology.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC6567521,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42729-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-11-885467 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Mar 7;133(10):1108-1118. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-11-885467.

However, comprehensive analyses investigating the association between miRNA expression profiles and AML survival remain relatively deficient. METHOD: In the present study, we performed multivariate Cox's analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify potential molecular signatures for predicting non-M3 AML prognosis. RESULT: We found that patients who were still living were significantly younger at diagnosis than those who had died (P = 0.001). In addition, there was a marked difference in living status among different risk category groups (P = 0.022). A multivariate Cox model suggested that three miRNAs were potential biomarkers of non-M3 AML prognosis, including miR-181a-2, miR-25 and miR-362. Subsequently, PCA analyses were conducted to comprehensively represent the expression levels of these three miRNAs in each patient with a PCA value. According to the log-rank test, AML outcome for patients with lower PCA values was significantly different from those with higher PCA values (P < 0.001). Further bioinformatic analysis revealed the biological functions of the selected miRNAs. CONCLUSION: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of TCGA non-M3 AML data, identifying three miRNAs that are significantly correlated with AML survival. PCA values for the identified miRNAs are valuable for predicting AML prognosis.","['Xue, Yao', 'Ge, Yuqiu', 'Kang, Meiyun', 'Wu, Cong', 'Wang, Yaping', 'Rong, Liucheng', 'Fang, Yongjun']","['Xue Y', 'Ge Y', 'Kang M', 'Wu C', 'Wang Y', 'Rong L', 'Fang Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Wuxi School of Medicine, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Wideband Wireless Communication Technology, Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. fyjpaper@163.com."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. fyjpaper@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190130,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6483142,,2019/02/01 06:00,2019/05/06 06:00,['2019/02/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5315-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5315-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jan 30;19(1):109. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5315-z.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'TCGA data', 'miRNAs']","['81602913/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81670155/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'BK20150085/Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province', 'YKK15140/Nanjing Medical Science and Technology Development Project', 'QRX17164/Nanjing Medical Science and Technology Development Foundation', '201503043/Nanjing Science and Technology Development Foundation', '2014NJMUZD079/Technology Development Foundation of Nanjing Medical University']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6170-6950'],,,20190503,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the neddylation (NEDD8) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways have emerged as promising pharmaceutical targets for AML therapy. However, the interaction of these two pathways remains unclear. Here we evaluated the effects of pevonedistat, an inhibitor of the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE), and sapanisertib (TAK-228), an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as single agents or in combination on AML cell lines. We found that inhibition of neddylation with pevonedistat partially inhibited mTOR signaling transduction and vice versa, inhibition of mTOR signaling with sapanisertib partially inhibited neddylation in AML cell lines. Pevonedistat alone was able to induce cytotoxicity in most AML cell lines as well as in primary AML, whereas sapanisertib alone decreased cell metabolic activity, reduced cell size and arrested cells in G0 phase with only minimal induction of cell death. In addition, pevonedistat was able to induce cell differentiation, arrest cells in G2/M cell cycle phases, and induce DNA re-replication and damage. However, co-treatment with sapanisertib suppressed pevonedistat induced apoptosis, differentiation, S/G2/M arrest, and DNA damage. Taken together, our data demonstrate that pevonedistat and sapanisertib exhibit distinct anti-tumor effects on AML cells, i.e. cytotoxic and cytostatic effects, respectively; however, sapanisertib can attenuate pevonedistat-induced cellular responses in AML cells. Understanding mTOR and neddylation pathway interaction could provide therapeutic strategies for treatment of AML and other malignancies.","['Guo, Naxin', 'Azadniv, Mitra', 'Coppage, Myra', 'Nemer, Mary', 'Mendler, Jason', 'Becker, Michael', 'Liesveld, Jane']","['Guo N', 'Azadniv M', 'Coppage M', 'Nemer M', 'Mendler J', 'Becker M', 'Liesveld J']","['Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642; Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642; Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642; Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642.

T-cell subtype of ALL (T-ALL) accounts for about 15% and 25% of ALL in children and adults, respectively. Being less frequent among ALL subtypes, T-ALL represents a high-risk factor for poor prognosis due to its aggressiveness and resistance to common antileukemic drugs. Mitochondria were widely explored recently as a target for anticancer treatment because they are involved in a metabolic reprogramming of a cancer cell and play key roles in reactive oxygen species generation, Ca(2+) signaling, and cell death induction. Accordingly, a new class of anticancer compounds named mitocans has been developed, which target mitochondria at distinct crucial points to promote their dysfunction and subsequent cell death. The present review analyses the role of mitochondria in malignant reprogramming and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria as an ""Achilles' heel"" in T-ALL, with an emphasis on BH3 mimetics, sequestering pro-survival BCL proteins and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)1-directed drugs, which promote the suppression of aerobic glycolysis, VDAC1 closure, mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, stoppage of the oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and release of proapoptotic factors.","['Olivas-Aguirre, Miguel', 'Pottosin, Igor', 'Dobrovinskaya, Oxana']","['Olivas-Aguirre M', 'Pottosin I', 'Dobrovinskaya O']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology and Ionic Transport Regulation, University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology and Ionic Transport Regulation, University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology and Ionic Transport Regulation, University Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, Colima, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190130,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2018/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.5VMR0818-330RR [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 May;105(5):935-946. doi: 10.1002/JLB.5VMR0818-330RR.

However, mechanisms for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells using various combinations of growth factors (targeting LIF or FGF2 pathways) and inhibitors (targeting WNT/GSK3 or FGF2 pathways) still have to be deciphered in other models, including the domestic cat. Our objective was to understand how cytokines influence pluripotency in the cat inner cell mass (ICM) outgrowths. Cat ICM was isolated from in vitro-produced embryos and outgrowths were cultured for up to 6 days with single or combined cytokines. Cell proliferation was enhanced with almost all single growth factors and cytokine combinations. Based on gene expression and presence of NANOG, POU5F1, and Sex-determining region Y box 2 (SOX2) as cell state markers, single growth factors could not maintain similar levels in outgrowths as in the original ICMs, which is different from the response in mouse and human. In our conditions, cytokine combinations involving LIF, GSK3 inhibitor, and MEK inhibitor resulted in the most robust expression levels and allowed single-cell dissociation and propagation. However, further characterization of embryonic cells derived from ICM indicated that the pluripotent state was not fully preserved. The absence of detectable transcripts for BMP2-receptor and SMAD4, and very low levels of LIF-receptor and STAT3 in the cat ICM indicated that pluripotency regulatory machinery appear to be different in the cat from the predominant mouse and human models.","['Zhou, Ran', 'Wildt, David E', 'Keefer, Carol L', 'Comizzoli, Pierre']","['Zhou R', 'Wildt DE', 'Keefer CL', 'Comizzoli P']","['1 Department of Animal and Avian Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.', '2 Center for Species Survival, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), Washington, District of Columbia.', '2 Center for Species Survival, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), Washington, District of Columbia.', '1 Department of Animal and Avian Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.', '2 Center for Species Survival, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), Washington, District of Columbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2018.0109 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2019 Mar 1;28(5):329-340. doi: 10.1089/scd.2018.0109.

However, the staining process and the choice of antibodies rely on laboratory expertise and may be source of variability or technical errors. Recently, Beckman Coulter commercialized a ready to use tube with dried format reagents for BCP-ALL MRD detection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the applicability of this tube and to compare it to a conventional (liquid format reagents) method. METHODS: Thirty-one samples from B ALL patients were analyzed: 19 bone marrow (BM) aspirations, 10 peripheral blood (PB) samples and 2 cerebrospinal fluids at different stages of the follow-up. In addition, we tested 5 bone marrow samples mixed into non-pathological (control) bone marrow. The dried format tube included seven antibodies: CD45Kro, CD58FITC, CD34ECD, CD10PC5.5, CD19PC7, CD38AA700, CD20AA750, with possibility of additional antibodies for blast markers identified at diagnosis. For comparison, a liquid format tube was prepared, and considered as the reference. RESULTS: This tube was validated for daily routine laboratory, with satisfying qualitative (MRD + or MRD-) and quantitative (MRD percentages) correlation with the reference tube. CONCLUSION: With this single dried format tube, we showed interesting results for BCP-ALL MRD detection in the aim of standardization and reliable interlaboratory results.

This condition is associated with poor outcome, and dermatologists are often responsible for making the initial diagnosis in a timely fashion. To describe a case of ALC and review the literature with an emphasis on the clinical features, summarizing the cutaneous manifestations of this rare systemic disorder. Electronic searches were performed in PubMed and Embase for published studies and case reports in English from 1970 to 2017. The presented case is a 46-year-old male with numerous asymptomatic skin-colored papules, plaques, and subcutaneous nodules with no detectable peripheral blood involvement, who was treated and subsequently relapsed twice with no evidence of peripheral blood or bone marrow involvement. Based on the review, skin nodules were the most common physical exam finding, comprising 27 cases (62.8%). The most common anatomic locations of cutaneous findings were the trunk and extremities, occurring in 23 (53.5%) and 20 (46.5%) cases, respectively. Since the cutaneous presentation of ALC is notably variable, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required. In view of this case and review of the literature, leukemia cutis should be included in the differential diagnosis of evolving, infiltrative cutaneous nodules or plaques, triggering an evaluation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood when the pathologic features raise concern for this disorder.","['Elkeeb, Dena', 'Hopkins, Zachary', 'Miles, Rodney R', 'Halwani, Ahmad', 'Wada, David']","['Elkeeb D', 'Hopkins Z', 'Miles RR', 'Halwani A', 'Wada D']","['University of Chicago Medicine, Section of Dermatology, Chicago, Illinois, USA, University of Utah, Department of Dermatology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'University of Utah, School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'University of Utah, Department of Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, University of Utah, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'University of Utah, Department of Dermatology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Eur J Dermatol,European journal of dermatology : EJD,9206420,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2019/05/24 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ejd.2018.3463 [pii]', '10.1684/ejd.2018.3463 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Dermatol. 2018 Dec 1;28(6):809-817. doi: 10.1684/ejd.2018.3463.,['NOTNLM'],"['aleukemic', 'bone marrow', 'cutis', 'leukemia', 'myeloid']",,,,,,20190523,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Recurrence', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30698092,NLM,MEDLINE,20190314,2376-1032 (Electronic),25,2,2019 Feb,Modeling Episode-Based Payments for Cancer Using Commercial Claims Data.,235-245,10.18553/jmcp.2019.25.2.235 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Innovative health care reimbursement models are gaining attention as a way to move away from a payment system that rewards quantity of service over quality of care. One such alternative payment model is episode-based payment, such as the Oncology Care Model (OCM) being piloted by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation. OBJECTIVE: To adapt the OCM methodology to a commercially insured population to understand the challenges and potential implications of implementing an episode-based payment model in a commercial health plan. METHODS: Administrative claims databases from 3 regional commercial health plans were used to identify continually eligible patients (aged >/= 18 years) with breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Episode triggers were identified using the OCM methodology. In calculating the episode-based payments, adjustments to the OCM methodology were necessary to adapt the methodology to a commercial population, since not all Medicare data elements used in the OCM algorithm are available in commercial claims data. RESULTS: The adapted OCM-like model was applied to data from 39,967 patients with 1 of 4 cancer types. Approximately 13% of patients had at least 1 episode per year and the average number of episodes per patient per year for patients with at least 1 episode ranged from 1.42 for patients with melanoma to 1.94 for patients with CML. The percentage of total annual costs included in episodes was 49%, 60%, 34%, and 52% for breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and CML, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As health care financing shifts to alternative payment models, insurers may look to adopt episode-based payments for oncology, similar to the OCM. This study shows that implementing an OCM-like model in a commercial health plan is feasible but will require adjustments to the OCM algorithm to make it implementable and applicable to populations beyond Medicare.

Payers are exposed to cost through doctor visits, laboratory tests, imaging tests, radiation treatment, drugs, hospital stays, surgery, home care, transportation and travel, and caregiving. This study focuses on the cost of medication from the viewpoint of U.S. payers. Although new tools for managing these costs have been gaining attention, prices continue to rise, and challenges to managing costs remain high. Innovative tools are necessary for controlling the cost of care in oncology, but their effectiveness is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: To (a) gauge payer perceptions of current and future cost management of innovative oncology drugs and (b) predict which management tools will increase in prevalence by 2020-2022. METHODS: A literature search of cost and management of oncology created the foundation for developing a survey for U.S. payers. The mobile survey was completed on devices such as smart phones or tablets. Payers were asked about general oncology product management, use of specific management tools today, management challenges, and expected use of specific management tools in 2020-2022. Management tools were segmented into traditional (used across many therapeutic categories), oncology-specific (used in oncology but not routinely used in other disease areas), and systemic (not product-specific but that affect the way services are provided and funded). Specific questions for managing the cost of care in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were included in the survey. NSCLC and CLL were chosen because of their diverse clinical characteristics and the level of innovation in these disease areas. The survey was fielded from May 31, 2017, to June 15, 2017. Results consisted of simple descriptive statistical analysis weighted by the payer's reported organizational covered lives. RESULTS: Payers were concerned with the high cost and budget impact of oncology drugs and considered these a high priority for management. However, they continue to use traditional management tools such as manage to FDA label, quantity limits, step edits, and reauthorizations, which are ineffective in controlling cost. More innovative management tools such as pathways of care are available but are not yet widely adopted. Payers hope to better control oncology cost in the future; however, specific questions pertaining to the management of NSCLC and CLL indicate that minimal changes in cost management will occur by 2020-2022. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increasing number of innovative cost management tools, challenges remain for managing oncology medication costs. New incentives are being generated, but barriers to their implementation will continue to restrict use through 2020-2022. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

We illustrate with motivating examples two methods for the creation of historical controls where disease progression and overall survival are typically the key clinically meaningful endpoints. The first method utilises information routinely collected in a clinical trial programme: patients' time to disease progression on their previous line of treatment against which outcomes can be compared. The second uses published clinical outcomes for the prior line of treatment which can be extrapolated to estimate outcomes at the next line. As examples we use two pharmaceuticals licensed on the basis of uncontrolled clinical studies - idelalisib for double-refractory follicular lymphoma and ofatumumab for double-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Although subject to limitations that should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the methods may be appropriate when trying to quantify the clinical benefit of treatment based on limited and uncontrolled trial data. As a result, the methods can be used to inform health technology adoption decisions.","['Hatswell, Anthony J', 'Sullivan, William G']","['Hatswell AJ', 'Sullivan WG']","['BresMed Health Solutions, Steel City House, West Street, Sheffield, UK.', 'Department of Economics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK.', 'Delta Hat Limited, Long Eaton, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190130,England,Stat Methods Med Res,Statistical methods in medical research,9212457,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0962280219826609 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Methods Med Res. 2020 Jun;29(6):1563-1572. doi: 10.1177/0962280219826609.

Here, we report a case of CEL carrying a novel fusion gene involving PDGFRB and GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 2 (GCC2). PATIENT AND METHODS: A 54-year-old man presenting with a cough and dyspnea was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed the presence of t(2;5)(q37;q31). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in the peripheral blood leukocytes revealed the presence of a split signal at PDGFRB gene. Imatinib treatment was effective, and disappearance of t(2;5)(q37;q31) in the bone marrow was confirmed after three months of imatinib therapy. Whole-genome sequencing was performed in peripheral blood leukocytes collected before imatinib therapy. RESULTS: A novel fusion gene between exon 22 of GCC2 and exon 12 of PDGFRB was detected and the presence of GCC2-PDGFRB was confirmed by PCR.

Data from developing countries is sparse in the literature. In this retrospective study, 402 patients aged >/= 60 years, diagnosed between Jan 2013 and Dec 2017, were analyzed for treatment patterns and survival. Median age of the whole cohort was 68 years (range 61-84). A total of 213 patients (53.3%) refused care; 188 patients (46.7%) received either BSC, LDAC, or HMA. Survival (in months) was 3.9, 6.4, and 1.2 with LDAC, HMA, and BSC, respectively. One-year survival was 17.2% and 6% with HMA and LDAC, respectively (P = 0.02). Overall response rate (ORR) did not differ between HMA and LDAC group (p = 0.12). HMA cohort had higher complete responses (20.6% vs 7.4%, p = 0.02), stable disease (32.7% vs 13.5%, p = 0.02), and transfusion independence (TI) (46.5% vs 22.2%, p = 0.01). Survival did not differ between the groups if the patients achieved ORR (12.3 vs 9.8 p = 0.2) or TI (11.6 vs 6.4 p = 0.2). Stable disease with HMA led to longer survival (8.1 vs 5.3 p = 0.01). HMAs were more effective than LDAC irrespective of cytogenetic risk category and blasts, of note HMAs improved survival of poor risk patients (5.6 vs 2.9 p = 0.004).

However, it has not been established if repeat molecular or genetic testing during chemotherapy can offer information regarding the chemotherapy sensitivity of the leukemic clone. Blood from 45 adult AML patients at day 1 and 4 of induction (n = 35) or salvage (n = 10) cytotoxic chemotherapy was collected for both quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assessment (WT1) and next generation sequencing (>500 x depth) of 49 gene regions recurrently mutated in MDS/AML. The median age of subjects was 62 (23-78); 42% achieved a complete response. WT1 was overexpressed in most patients tested but was uninformative for very early MRD assessment. A median of 4 non-synonymous variants (range 0-7) were detected by DNA sequencing of blood on day 1 of therapy [median variant allele frequency (VAF): 29%]. Only two patients had no variants detectable. All mutations remained detectable in blood on day 4 of intensive chemotherapy and remarkably the ratio of mutated to wild-type sequence was often maintained. This phenomenon was not limited to variants in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The kinetics of NPM1 and TP53 variant burden early during chemotherapy appeared to be exceptions and exhibited consistent trends in this cohort. In summary, molecular testing of blood on day 4 of chemotherapy is not predictive of clinical response to cytotoxic induction therapy in AML. The observed stability in variant allele frequency suggests that cytotoxic therapy may have a limited therapeutic index for clones circulating in blood containing these mutations. Further validation is required to confirm the utility of monitoring NPM1 and TP53 kinetics in blood during cytotoxic therapy.","['Wong, Hong Yuen', 'Sung, Anthony D', 'Lindblad, Katherine E', 'Sheela, Sheenu', 'Roloff, Gregory W', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Goswami, Meghali', 'Mule, Matthew P', 'Ramos, Nestor R', 'Tang, Jingrong', 'Thompson, Julie', 'DeStefano, Christin B', 'Romero, Kristi', 'Dillon, Laura W', 'Kim, Dong-Yun', 'Lai, Catherine', 'Hourigan, Christopher S']","['Wong HY', 'Sung AD', 'Lindblad KE', 'Sheela S', 'Roloff GW', 'Rizzieri D', 'Goswami M', 'Mule MP', 'Ramos NR', 'Tang J', 'Thompson J', 'DeStefano CB', 'Romero K', 'Dillon LW', 'Kim DY', 'Lai C', 'Hourigan CS']","['Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190115,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC6341003,,2019/01/31 06:00,2019/01/31 06:01,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2018/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00669 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jan 15;8:669. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00669. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['MRD', 'Next Gen Sequencing (NGS)', 'WT1 = Wilms tumor 1', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'measurable residual disease (MRD)', 'remission', 'somatic mutations in cancer']","['KL2 TR001115/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG028716/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in molecular profiling and cytogenetics have identified a broad range of genetic abnormalities, including gene mutations, chromosome translocations and aneuploidy, which has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of ALL. This understanding has also led to new targeted therapeutic approaches, including the use of selective small molecule inhibitors, nucleic acid-based therapies and immune-based therapies mediated by specific monoclonal antibodies and cellular immunotherapy, which are poised to revolutionize the treatment of various ALL subtypes. The main focus of this review is to highlight the latest advances in ALL biology, including the identification of prognostic factors and putative therapeutic targets.

Although limited reports suggested the oncogenic role of PIP4K2A in cancers, regulatory network and prognostic effect of this gene remains poorly understood in tumorigenesis and leukemogenesis. In this study, we conducted genome-wide gene expression association analyses in pediatric B-ALL cohorts to discover expression associated genes and pathways, which is followed by the bioinformatics analyses to investigate the prognostic role of PIP4K2A and its related genes in multiple cancer types. 214 candidates were identified to be significantly associated with PIP4K2A expression in ALL patients, with known cancer-related genes rankings the top (e.g., RAC2, RBL2, and TFDP1). These candidates do not only tend to be clustered in the same types of leukemia, but can also separate the patients into novel molecular subtypes. PIP4K2A is noticed to be frequently overexpressed in multiple other types of leukemia and solid cancers from cancer cohorts including TCGA, and associated with its candidates in subtype-specific and cancer-specific manners. Interestingly, the association status varied in tumors compared to their matched normal tissues. Moreover, PIP4K2A and its related candidates exhibit stage-independent prognostic effects in multiple cancers, mostly with its lower expression significantly associated with longer overall survival (p < 0.05). Our findings reveal the transcriptional regulatory network of PIP4K2A in leukemia, and suggest its potentially important role on molecular subtypes of multiple cancers and subsequent treatment outcomes.","['Zhang, Shouyue', 'Li, Zhaozhi', 'Yan, Xinyu', 'Bao, Li', 'Deng, Yun', 'Zeng, Feier', 'Wang, Peiqi', 'Zhu, Jianhui', 'Yin, Dandan', 'Liao, Fei', 'Zhou, Xueyan', 'Zhang, Duyu', 'Xia,

In contrast to normal B and T cells, transcription of GC-regulated genes was not rhythmic and the synthetic GC dexamethasone (DEX) could not inhibit toll-like receptor (TLR)-responses in CLL cells. This intrinsic GC-resistance was associated with aberrant GR-phosphorylation on activating Ser211 and inhibitory Ser226 sites. Ibrutinib increased transcription of the GR-signature gene GILZ in circulating CLL cells along with GR(pS211)/GR(pS226) ratios and lytic sensitivity to DEX that were not reversed by the competitive antagonist mifepristone in vitro. However, ibrutinib could not improve GR-responses in circulating CLL cells activated with IL2 and TLR7/8 agonists to mimic conditions in pseudofollicle microenvironments. Addition of the janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib to block ibrutinib-insensitive signals increased GILZ transcription in pseudofollicle conditions in vitro and in a clinical trial (NCT02912754), and also increased GR(S211)/GR(S226) ratios and DEX-mediated killing in patient samples in vitro. These observations suggest that intrinsic resistance to endogenous GCs is characteristic of CLL cells and ibrutinib may help increase the therapeutic activity of GCs by non-canonical activation of GR.","['Shi, Yonghong', 'Wang, Guizhi', 'Muhowski, Elizabeth M', 'McCaw, Lindsay', 'Wang, Catherine', 'Bjarnason, Georg', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Spaner, David E']","['Shi Y', 'Wang G', 'Muhowski EM', 'McCaw L', 'Wang C', 'Bjarnason G', 'Woyach JA', 'Spaner DE']","['Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, M4N 3M5, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, M4N 3M5, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, M4N 3M5, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, M4N 3M5, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, M4N 3M5, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, M5G 2C4, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, M4N 3M5, Toronto, ON, Canada. david.spaner@sunnybrook.ca.', 'Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, M4N 3M5, Toronto, ON, Canada. david.spaner@sunnybrook.ca.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, M5G 2C4, Toronto, ON, Canada. david.spaner@sunnybrook.ca.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, M5S 1A8, Toronto, ON, Canada. david.spaner@sunnybrook.ca.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, M5G 2M9, Toronto, ON, Canada. david.spaner@sunnybrook.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0381-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0381-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jul;33(7):1650-1662. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0381-4.

To explore novel driver genes and their pathogenetic significance, we performed whole-exome sequence analysis of four individuals from a familial MDS pedigree and 10 candidate single-nucleotide variants (C9orf43, CYP7B1, EFHB, ENTPD7, FAM160B2, HELZ2, HLTF, INPP5J, ITPKB, and RYK) were identified. Knockdown screening revealed that Hltf downregulation enhanced colony-forming capacity of primary murine bone marrow (BM) stem/progenitor cells. gammaH2AX immunofluorescent staining assay revealed increased DNA damage in a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line ectopically expressing HLTF E259K, which was not observed in cells expressing wild-type HLTF. Silencing of HLTF in human AML cells also led to DNA damage, indicating that HLTF E259K is a loss-of-function mutation. Molecularly, we found that an E259K mutation reduced the binding capacity of HLTF with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, methanesulfonate sensitive 2 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2N, resulting in impaired polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in HLTF E259K-transduced cells. In summary, our results indicate that a familial MDS-associated HLTF E259K germline mutation induces accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, possibly through impaired PCNA polyubiquitination.","['Takaoka, Kensuke', 'Kawazu, Masahito', 'Koya, Junji', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Masamoto, Yosuke', 'Maki, Hiroaki', 'Toya, Takashi', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Ueno, Toshihide', 'Ueno, Hironori', 'Suzuki, Kenshi', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Takaoka K', 'Kawazu M', 'Koya J', 'Yoshimi A', 'Masamoto Y', 'Maki H', 'Toya T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Nannya Y', 'Arai S', 'Ueno T', 'Ueno H', 'Suzuki K', 'Harada H', 'Manabe A', 'Hayashi Y', 'Mano H', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genomics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular Signaling, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Gunma, Japan."", 'Department of Cellular Signaling, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. kurokawa-tky@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2018/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0385-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0385-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jul;33(7):1773-1782. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0385-0.

These glycosyltransferases transfer N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) or d-galactose forming an alpha1,3-glycosidic linkage. However, their acceptor substrates are diverse. Previously, we demonstrated that the amino acids at codons 266 and 268 of human AT/BT are crucial to their distinct sugar specificities, elucidating the molecular genetic basis of the ABO glycosylation polymorphism of clinical importance in transfusion and transplantation medicine. We also prepared in vitro mutagenized ATs/BTs having any of 20 possible amino acids at those codons, and showed that those codons determine the transferase activity and sugar specificity. We have expanded structural analysis to include evolutionarily related alpha1,3-Gal(NAc) transferases. Eukaryotic expression constructs were prepared of AT, FS, iGb3S, and GT, possessing selected tripeptides of AT-specific AlaGlyGly or LeuGlyGly, BT-specific MetGlyAla, FS-specific GlyGlyAla, or iGb3S and GT-specific HisAlaAla, at the codons corresponding to 266-268 of human AT/BT. DNA transfection was performed using appropriate recipient cells existing and newly created, and the appearance of cell surface oligosaccharide antigens was immunologically examined. The results have shown that several tripeptides other than the originals also bestowed transferase activity. However, the repertoire of functional amino acids varied among those transferases, suggesting that structures around those codons differentially affected the interactions between donor nucleotide-sugar and acceptor substrates. It was concluded that different tripeptide sequences at the substrate-binding pocket have contributed to the generation of alpha1,3-Gal(NAc) transferases with diversified specificities.","['Cid, Emili', 'Yamamoto, Miyako', 'Yamamoto, Fumiichiro']","['Cid E', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamamoto F']","['Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain.', ""Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC), Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain."", 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain. fyamamoto@carrerasresearch.org.', ""Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC), Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain. fyamamoto@carrerasresearch.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190129,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6351642,,2019/01/31 06:00,2020/09/05 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-37515-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-37515-5 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jan 29;9(1):846. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-37515-5.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5025-352X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9516-1402', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9690-7034']",,,20200904,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Codon/chemistry/*genetics', 'Disaccharides/*metabolism', 'Galactans/*metabolism', 'Galactosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sugars/chemistry']","['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Galactans)', '0 (Sugars)', '0 (galactosyll(1,3)-N-acetylgalactosamine)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.87 (N-acetyllactosaminide alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients experience treatment resistance or rapid relapses, and in particular, those harboring a 17p/TP53 deletion (del(17p)). This resistance could be explained by a chemo-resistance, but it could also result from the direct impact of del(17p) on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab, which represents the aim of the present study. Accordingly, 44 CLL patients were included in the study, and among them 9 presented a del(17p). Next, a total of 233 rituximab sera were selected for a pharmacokinetic study and analyzed in a two-compartment model showing important differences when del(17p) CLL patients were compared with non-del(17p) patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy: (1) clearance of rituximab was faster; (2) central volume of rituximab distribution V1 (peripheral blood) was reduced while peripheral volume V2 (lymphoid organs and tissues) was increased; and (3) the rate of rituximab elimination (Kout) was faster. In contrast, the group with a better prognosis harboring isolated del(13q) presented a slower rate of elimination (Kout). Pharmacokinetic parameters were independent from the other factors tested such as age, sex, chemotherapy regimen (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide versus bendamustine), IGHV mutational status, and FCGR3A 158VF status. In conclusion, this study provides an additional argument to consider that del(17p) is effective not only to control chemoresistance but also monoclonal antibody activity, based on higher rituximab turnover.","['Bagacean, Cristina', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Ternant, David', 'Banet, Anne', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Bordron, Anne', 'Bendaoud, Boutahar', 'Saad, Hussam', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Paintaud, Gilles', 'Renaudineau, Yves']","['Bagacean C', 'Tempescul A', 'Ternant D', 'Banet A', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'Bordron A', 'Bendaoud B', 'Saad H', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Berthou C', 'Paintaud G', 'Renaudineau Y']","['U1227 B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, University of Brest; INSERM; networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France. cristina.bagacean@univ-brest.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, 5 Foch Avenue, BP 824, F-29609, Brest, France. cristina.bagacean@univ-brest.fr.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France. cristina.bagacean@univ-brest.fr.', 'U1227 B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, University of Brest; INSERM; networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, 5 Foch Avenue, BP 824, F-29609, Brest, France.', 'University of Tours, EA 7501 Innovation and Cell Targeting Group, CHRU de Tours, Laboratory of Pharmacology-Toxicology, Tours, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, 5 Foch Avenue, BP 824, F-29609, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.', 'U1227 B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, University of Brest; INSERM; networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, 5 Foch Avenue, BP 824, F-29609, Brest, France.', '""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'U1227 B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, University of Brest; INSERM; networks IC-CGO and REpiCGO from ""Canceropole Grand Ouest"", Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Brest University Medical School Hospital, 5 Foch Avenue, BP 824, F-29609, Brest, France.', 'University of Tours, EA 7501 Innovation and Cell Targeting Group, CHRU de Tours, Laboratory of Pharmacology-Toxicology, Tours, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Brest University Medical School Hospital, Brest, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190129,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,PMC6352369,,2019/01/31 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-019-0509-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-019-0509-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2019 Jan 29;7(1):22. doi: 10.1186/s40425-019-0509-0.,['NOTNLM'],"['*17p deletion', '*Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Clearance', '*Pharmacokinetics', '*Rituximab']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6061-992X'],,,20200527,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03294980'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of CF and associated factors in YACSs. Also, the change of fatigue with time was explored. Material and methods: The present cross-sectional study is part of a nation-wide population based survey of Norwegian survivors of cancer in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood (The NOR-CAYACS study).YACSs diagnosed at the age of 19-39 years with breast cancer stage </= III (BC), colorectal cancer (CRC), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or non-metastatic malignant melanoma (MM) were included 5-30 years after diagnosis. Survivors of MM treated with limited surgery were included as a reference group. CF was assessed by the Fatigue Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with CF. Results: In total, 1488 survivors completed the questionnaire (a response rate of 42%), of which 1088 were eligible for the present study. Overall, 25% reported CF. CF was significantly more prevalent among survivors of BC (29%) (p < .001), CRC (29%) (p = .001) and NHL (27%) (p = .003) than among survivors of MM (15%). CF was associated with systemic treatment combined with surgery and/or radiotherapy (p = .018), comorbidity (p = .038), pain (p = .002), numbness in hands/feet (p = .046), and depressive symptoms (p < .001) in the multivariable model. Among survivors with CF, 60% reported that they had been tired since cancer treatment, and among these, 65% reported worsening or no change of fatigue with time. Conclusion: One of four YACSs reported CF 15 years from diagnosis (mean). CF was associated with several possibly treatable factors. Health professionals involved in the follow-up of YACSs should have knowledge of CF and approaches to manage it.","['Bohn, Synne-Kristin H', 'Thorsen, Lene', 'Kiserud, Cecilie E', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Lie, Hanne C', 'Loge, Jon H', 'Wisloff, Torbjorn', 'Haugnes, Hege S', 'Reinertsen, Kristin V']","['Bohn SH', 'Thorsen L', 'Kiserud CE', 'Fossa SD', 'Lie HC', 'Loge JH', 'Wisloff T', 'Haugnes HS', 'Reinertsen KV']","['a National Advisory Unit on Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'a National Advisory Unit on Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Clinical Service , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'a National Advisory Unit on Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'a National Advisory Unit on Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'c Faculty of Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'a National Advisory Unit on Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'd Department of Behavioural Sciences in Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine Sciences, Faculty of Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'd Department of Behavioural Sciences in Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine Sciences, Faculty of Medicine , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'e Regional Advisory Unit on Palliative Care, Department of Oncology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.', 'f Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Modelling , Norwegian Institute of Public Health , Oslo , Norway.', 'g Department of Health Management and Health Economics , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway.', 'h Department of Clinical Medicine , Arctic University of Troms solidus in circle , Troms solidus in circle, Norway.', 'i Department of Oncology , University Hospital of North Norway , Troms solidus in circle, Norway.', 'a National Advisory Unit on Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology , Oslo University Hospital , Oslo , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20190130,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2018.1557344 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2019 May;58(5):753-762. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1557344.

Little is known about patient and relative preferences at this time and whether these are achieved. AIM: To explore the experiences and reflections of bereaved relatives of patients with leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma, and examine (1) preferred place of care and death; (2) perceptions of factors influencing attainment of preferences; and (3) changes that could promote achievement of preferences. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study incorporating 'Framework' analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 in-depth interviews with bereaved relatives. RESULTS: Although most people expressed a preference for home death, not all attained this. The influencing factors include disease characteristics (potential for sudden deterioration and death), the occurrence and timing of discussions (treatment cessation, prognosis, place of care/death), family networks (willingness/ability of relatives to provide care, knowledge about services, confidence to advocate) and resource availability (clinical care, hospice beds/policies). Preferences were described as changing over time and some family members retrospectively came to consider hospital as the 'right' place for the patient to have died. Others shared strong preferences with patients for home death and acted to ensure this was achieved. No patients died in a hospice, and relatives identified barriers to death in this setting. CONCLUSION: Preferences were not always achieved due to a series of complex, interrelated factors, some amenable to change and others less so. Death in hospital may be preferred and appropriate, or considered the best option in hindsight.","['McCaughan, Dorothy', 'Roman, Eve', 'Smith, Alexandra G', 'Garry, Anne C', 'Johnson, Miriam J', 'Patmore, Russell D', 'Howard, Martin R', 'Howell, Debra A']","['McCaughan D', 'Roman E', 'Smith AG', 'Garry AC', 'Johnson MJ', 'Patmore RD', 'Howard MR', 'Howell DA']","['1 Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, University of York, York, UK.', '1 Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, University of York, York, UK.', '1 Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, University of York, York, UK.', '2 Department of Palliative Care, York Hospital, York, UK.', '3 Wolfson Palliative Care Research Centre, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', ""4 Queen's Centre for Oncology and Haematology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK."", '5 Department of Haematology, York Hospital, York, UK.', '1 Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, University of York, York, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190130,England,Palliat Med,Palliative medicine,8704926,PMC6507303,,2019/01/31 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0269216318824525 [doi]'],ppublish,Palliat Med. 2019 May;33(5):518-530. doi: 10.1177/0269216318824525.

SSD treatment exerted cytotoxicity in U266 and U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also, apoptosis-related proteins such as PARP, procaspase-3, and Bax were regulated by SSD treatment. Furthermore, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed that a number of apoptotic bodies were increased by SSD. Interestingly, the ER stress-related proteins such as p-ATF2 and CHOP were elevated by SSD. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytotoxicity by SSD treatment were significantly reduced by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Among the microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by SSD treatment, miR-657 was most significantly reduced by SSD treatment. However, an miR-657 mimic reversed SSD-induced apoptosis by the attenuation of the expression of p-ATF2, CHOP, and PARP cleavage. Overall, these findings provide scientific evidence that miR657 is an onco-miRNA targeting the ER stress signal pathway and SSD induces apoptosis via the inhibition of miR-657, ROS, and the activation of p-ATF2 and CHOP as a potent anti-cancer agent for myeloid-originated hematological cancer.","['Lim, Hyun Ji', 'Park, Moon Nyeo', 'Kim, Changmin', 'Kang, Beomku', 'Song, Hyo-Sook', 'Lee, Hyemin', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon', 'Shim, Bum-Sang', 'Kim, Bonglee']","['Lim HJ', 'Park MN', 'Kim C', 'Kang B', 'Song HS', 'Lee H', 'Kim SH', 'Shim BS', 'Kim B']","['College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. hyunjilim@khu.ac.kr.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. mnpark@khu.ac.kr.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. ckdals4302@khu.ac.kr.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. beomkukang@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. shs331@khu.ac.kr.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. glansy555@gmail.com.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. sungkim7@khu.ac.kr.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. eshimbs@khu.ac.kr.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea. bongleekim@khu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190128,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC6406694,,2019/01/31 06:00,2019/01/31 06:01,['2019/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11020150 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11020150 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Jan 28;11(2). pii: cancers11020150. doi: 10.3390/cancers11020150.,['NOTNLM'],"['C/EBP homologous protein', 'N-Acetyl-L-cysteine', 'Spatholobus suberectus Dunn', 'activating transcription factor 2', 'apoptosis', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'miR-657', 'multiple myeloma', 'myeloid leukemia', 'reactive oxygen species']","['NRF-2016R1D1A1B03933656 and NRF-2017R1A6A3A11034048/the Basic Science Research', 'Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the', 'Ministry of Education']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3910-5611', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2423-1973', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8678-156X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, no study has evaluated the expression on SM bone marrow mast cells (BMMC) of large panel of cell surface suitable for antibody-targeted therapy. In this study, we analyzed the expression profile of six cell-surface proteins for which antibody-based therapies are available, on BMMC from 166 SM patients vs. 40 controls. Overall, variable patterns of expression for the markers evaluated were observed among SM BMMC. Thus, CD22, CD30, and CD123, while expressed on BMMC from patients within every subtype of SM, showed highly variable patterns with a significant fraction of negative cases among advanced SM (aggressive SM (ASM), ASM with an associated clonal non-MC lineage disease (ASM-AHN) and MC leukemia (MCL)), 36%, 46%, and 39%, respectively. In turn, CD25 and FcepsilonRI were found to be expressed in most cases (89% and 92%) in virtually all BMMC (median: 92% and 95%) from both indolent and advanced SM, but with lower/absent levels in a significant fraction of MC leukemia (MCL) and both in MCL and well-differentiated SM (WDSM) patients, respectively. In contrast, CD33 was the only marker expressed on all BMMC from every SM patient. Thus, CD33 emerges as the best potentially targetable cell-surface membrane marker in SM, particularly in advanced SM.","['Dasilva-Freire, Noelia', 'Mayado, Andrea', 'Teodosio, Cristina',

Methods: Clinical data of 35 children with newly diagnosed CML-CP in Beijing Children's Hospital from January 2014 to January 2018 were collected, among which 15 cases were treated with the imported original imatinib (original drug group) and 20 cases were treated with the domestic generic imatinib (generic drug group). The hematological, cytogenetic and molecular reactions and safety of the treatments were monitored at months 3, 6 and 12. Chi square test or rank sum test was used for the comparison between two groups. Results: A total of 35 cases were treated for over 3 months, 31 cases were treated for over 6 months and 25 cases were treated for over 12 months.

At 6 months, complete cytogenetic response was obtained in 12 (80%) cases in the original drug group and 10 (63%) cases in the generic drug group (chi(2)=1.435, P=0.390). At 12 months, BCR-ABL(IS) </= 0.1% was obtained in 11 (92%) cases in the original drug group and 10 (77%) cases in the generic drug group (chi(2)=1.009, P=0.593). There was no significant difference at all stages (all P>0.05). Hematologic toxicity occurred in 7(20%) cases. The non-hematologic adverse reactions include nausea in 8 (23%) cases, pain in 8 (23%) cases, edema in 6 (17%) cases, emesis in 2 (6%) cases, fever in 2 (6%) cases, weakness in 1 (3%) case, rash in 1 (3%) case. The adverse reactions were easy to control and no drug toxicity related deaths occurred. There was no significant difference in the adverse reactions between original drug group and generic drug group (P>0.05). Conclusions: Imatinib had a good efficacy and safety in the early treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP in children. The efficacy and safety of generic imatinib is similar to that of imported imatinib.","['Zhang, L Q', 'Zheng, J', 'Chen, Z P', 'Li, S D', 'Ma, J', 'Wu, R H']","['Zhang LQ', 'Zheng J', 'Chen ZP', 'Li SD', 'Ma J', 'Wu RH']","[""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,,2019/01/31 06:00,2019/08/23 06:00,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2019.02.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Feb 2;57(2):113-117. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2019.02.010.,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Cytogenetics', 'Leukemia, myeloid, chronic-phase']",['ZY201404/Development of Clinical Medicine in Beijing Hospital Authority'],,,,,20190822,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study 25 patients (16 women and 9 men) who had undergone treatment for ALL in childhood were assessed. Patients underwent polychemo- therapy and cranial irradiation. Average age at the time of the survey - 21,2+/-3,9 years; average age at the time of treatment - 6,9+/-3,4 years; average follow-up - 13,8+/-4,9 years. Healthy volunteers were included in the control group (10 women and 6 men) at the age of 25,9+/-3,6 years. Patients' anthropometric and laboratory parameters were measured. RESULTS: SDS of the final height in ALL survivors was significantly lower in comparison with the control group (p=0,009). ALL survivors had significantly higher difference between final and target height compared to control (p=0,049). 4 of 8 men (50,0% CI: 24,5% - 75,5%) and 13 of 15 women (86,7% CI:68,1-95,7%) have reached the target height. 73,9% (CI: 56,3% - 86,8%) of ALL survivors have reached target height which is significantly lower than in the control group (p<0,001). We found a significant backward correlation be- tween the age at the time of treatment and reaching of the target height (r=-0,415, p=0,049). ALL survivors also suffered from obesity - 12%, dyslipidemia - 36,8%, insulin resistance - 66,7%. CONCLUSION: Treatment for ALL in childhood causes a de- crease of final height. Its main risk factor is the age at the time of the treatment. ALL survivors are diagnosed with the other endocrine disorders and they need an endocrinologist's observation.","['Tselovalnikova, T Yu', 'Pavlova, M G', 'Zilov, A V', 'Mazerkina, N A', 'Zheludkova, O G', 'Arefyeva, I A', 'Gerasimov, A N']","['Tselovalnikova TY', 'Pavlova MG', 'Zilov AV', 'Mazerkina NA', 'Zheludkova OG', 'Arefyeva IA', 'Gerasimov AN']",,['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Vopr Onkol,Voprosy onkologii,0413775,,,2016/01/01 00:00,2016/01/01 00:01,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vopr Onkol. 2016;62(6):817-821.,,,,,,,,20190219,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', '*Body Height', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Growth Disorders/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 30% of pa- tients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) harbor FLT3 mutations. The most frequent FLT3 mutations are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain. FLT3-ITD mutations cause ligand-independent dimerization of FLT3 and the constitutive activation of its downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, A4APK/ERK, and STAT5, leading to dysregulated cellular prolifera- tion. The relapse risk of CN-AML patients with FLT3-ITD is higher and the overall survival (OS) of such patients is shorter than those of patients with wild-type FLT3. Recently genome-wide studies with next-generation sequencing have suggested that mutational combinations of genes related to signal transduction, transcription, splicing, cancer suppressors, and epigenetics contribute to the pathogenesis of AML. These mutations including FLT3-ITD may be prognostic factors facilitating the risk stratification for CN-AML. The point mutations D835/I836 in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are detected in 5-7% of AML patients. The clinical relevance of these FLT3-TKD mutations remains unclear. FLT3-TKD mutations are detected even in patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors as secondary mutations, suggesting that the mutations are as- sociated with the resistance. Therefore, the detection of these mutations might provide us with the opportunity to consider appropriate treatment for patients. The molecular abnormalities in AML patients give us insights into the pathology of AML and clinically significant information required for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions.

Most agents used are monoclonal antibodies (""biologics"") and low-molecular-weight compounds. Molecular targeted therapy is widely utilized against malignancies, such as imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia blocking BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, gefitinib for non-small cell lung cancer interrupt- ing signal transduction through EGFR, and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer. It is a companion diagnostic used as a companion to a molecular targeted drug to determine its applicability for a specific patient, showing the importance of laboratory tests for cancer treatment. While the pathogeneses of connective tissue diseases are still unknown, recent progress in understanding the pathophysiology enables us to use molecular targeted drugs for effective treatment. Rheumatoid arthri- tis (RA) is the most common connective tissue disease, and inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL-6 play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of RA. In Japan, successful treatment of RA with a chimeric antibody to TNFa(infliximab) is followed by a number of anti-cytokine drugs, such as humanized anti-TNFa, anti- TNF receptor, and anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies. A fusion protein (abatacept), an inhibitor of activated T- cells, composed of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 and the Fc region of IgG1, and more recently Janus kinase inhibitor (tofacitinib), have also been demonstrated to be highly effective. Since molecular targeted therapy suppresses the immune function, patients receiving the therapy become susceptible to infection. Thus, clinical laboratory tests are of great importance, not only to classify potentially high-risk patients (especially in the case of the so-called post-infectious state of tuberculosis and hepatitis B to avoid reactivation) before treatment but also for the early detection of infections during treatment.

This style of joint symposium was held four times from 2012 to 2016, whereas child cases were presented for the first time this year. The 4 cases presented in this symposium were as follows: an infant with Down syn- drome showing an atypical clinical course of transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) and myeloid leukemia, a relatively older girl with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), one adult with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv (16) (p13.1q22); CBFB-MYH11 morphologically resembling AML with t (8;21) (q22;q22.1); RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and one adult with high-grade B-cell lymphoma showing t (14;18) (q32;q21); IGH/BCL2. Each case included pathological and interesting morphological findings that were carefully examined and in- tensively discussed by two experienced commentators and participants, including pediatric hemato- pathologists. The importance of the morphological evaluation of characteristic cells such as immature leukemic blasts or lymphomatous ones was reconfirmed at this conference. In addition, immunological, cytogenetic, and molecular examinations were also essential for the final diagnosis of these cases.

However, the diagnosis and prognosis of Annexin family expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of Annexin expressions in adult and pediatric AML. METHODS: GenomicScape tool was used to assess the prognostic value of the expressions of Annexin family members in a cohort of 162 adult AML patients. Quantitative reverse transcript real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed to detect the ANXA2 expression level in the bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMCs) obtained from 101 pediatric AML patients and 30 controls. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that high mRNA expressions of ANXA2, ANXA6, and ANXA7 were significantly associated with worse prognosis, while ANXA5 was correlated with better prognosis in adult AML. QRT-PCR analysis showed that ANXA2 expression was dramatically downregulated in BMMCs of pediatric AML patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001). ROC analysis demonstrated that ANXA2 could efficiently differentiate pediatric AML patients from controls (AUC 0.872, p < 0.0001). Likewise, ANXA2 was significantly lower in AML patients with poor-risk karyotype (p = 0.048). Also, the level of ANXA2 trended to decrease in AML patients who had not achieving complete remission. Moreover, patients with lower expression of ANXA2 had higher death rate (p = 0.042) and shorter overall survival (HR 0.55, p = 0.042). Thus, these findings suggest that ANXA2 exerts poor prognostic effect on adult AML but favorable prognostic effect on pediatric AML. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, Annexin family members exert distinct prognostic roles in AML, and ANXA2 can be used as a biological marker for diagnosis and prognosis of pediatric AML.","['Niu, Y', 'Yang, X', 'Chen, Y', 'Jin, X', 'Xie, Y', 'Tang, Y', 'Li, L', 'Liu, S', 'Guo, Y', 'Li, X', 'Duan, L', 'Wang, H']","['Niu Y', 'Yang X', 'Chen Y', 'Jin X', 'Xie Y', 'Tang Y', 'Li L', 'Liu S', 'Guo Y', 'Li X', 'Duan L', 'Wang H']","[""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China. wanghui@xxmu.edu.cn."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, 453003, Henan, People's Republic of China. wanghui@xxmu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190129,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,,2019/01/30 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-019-02045-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-019-02045-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2019 Sep;21(9):1186-1196. doi: 10.1007/s12094-019-02045-7.

Today, people can obtain relevant information from not only medical workers in hospitals, but also the internet in any place in real-time. Search behaviors can reflect a population's awareness of cancer from a completely new perspective, which could be driven by the underlying cancer epidemiology. However, such Web-retrieved data are not yet well validated or understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether a correlation exists between the incidence and mortality of cancers and normalized internet search volumes on the big data platform, Baidu. We also assessed whether the distribution of people who searched for specific types of cancer differed by gender. Finally, we determined whether there were regional disparities among people who searched the Web for cancer-related information. METHODS: Standard Boolean operators were used to choose search terms for each type of cancer. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to explore correlations among monthly search index values for each cancer type and their monthly incidence and mortality rates. We conducted cointegration analysis between search index data and incidence rates to examine whether a stable equilibrium existed between them. We also conducted cointegration analysis between search index data and mortality data. RESULTS: The monthly Baidu index was significantly correlated with cancer incidence rates for 26 of 28 cancers in China (lung cancer: r=.80, P<.001; liver cancer: r=.28, P=.016; stomach cancer: r=.50, P<.001; esophageal cancer: r=.50, P<.001; colorectal cancer: r=.81, P<.001; pancreatic cancer: r=.86, P<.001; breast cancer: r=.56, P<.001; brain and nervous system cancer: r=.63, P<.001; leukemia: r=.75, P<.001; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: r=.88, P<.001; Hodgkin lymphoma: r=.91, P<.001; cervical cancer: r=.64, P<.001; prostate cancer: r=.67, P<.001; bladder cancer: r=.62, P<.001; gallbladder and biliary tract cancer: r=.88, P<.001; lip and oral cavity cancer: r=.88, P<.001; ovarian cancer: r=.58, P<.001; larynx cancer: r=.82, P<.001; kidney cancer: r=.73, P<.001; squamous cell carcinoma: r=.94, P<.001; multiple myeloma: r=.84, P<.001; thyroid cancer: r=.77, P<.001; malignant skin melanoma: r=.55, P<.001; mesothelioma: r=.79, P<.001; testicular cancer: r=.57, P<.001; basal cell carcinoma: r=.83, P<.001). The monthly Baidu index was significantly correlated with cancer mortality rates for 24 of 27 cancers. In terms of the whole population, the number of women who searched for cancer-related information has slowly risen over time. People aged 30-39 years were most likely to use search engines to retrieve cancer-related knowledge. East China had the highest Web search volumes for cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Search behaviors indeed reflect public awareness of cancer from a different angle. Research on internet search behaviors could present an innovative and timely way to monitor and estimate cancer incidence and mortality rates, especially for cancers not included in national registries.","['Xu, Chenjie', 'Wang, Yi', 'Yang, Hongxi', 'Hou, Jie', 'Sun, Li', 'Zhang, Xinyu', 'Cao, Xinxi', 'Hou, Yabing', 'Wang, Lan', 'Cai, Qiliang', 'Wang, Yaogang']","['Xu C', 'Wang Y', 'Yang H', 'Hou J', 'Sun L', 'Zhang X', 'Cao X', 'Hou Y', 'Wang L', 'Cai Q', 'Wang Y']","['School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, United States.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Nursing, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Nursing, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190129,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,PMC6371071,,2019/01/30 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['v21i1e10677 [pii]', '10.2196/10677 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2019 Jan 29;21(1):e10677. doi: 10.2196/10677.,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*incidence', '*internet searching', '*mortality', '*web-based data']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8997-9299', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4815-336X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9545-5715', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3454-6274', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8211-6124', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4426-939X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0260-5823', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1572-5584', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0430-4138', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7147-0953', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7325-0663']",,,20200121,IM,"['Adult', 'China', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Internet', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Search Engine', 'Telemedicine/*methods']",,,,"['(c)Chenjie Xu, Yi Wang, Hongxi Yang, Jie Hou, Li Sun, Xinyu Zhang, Xinxi Cao,', 'Yabing Hou, Lan Wang, Qiliang Cai, Yaogang Wang.

FL is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and is still incurable in most patients. Thus, new drugs and/or novel combination treatment strategies are needed to further improve FL patient outcome. We investigated the efficacy of the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor A452 combined with a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib on NHL and the underlying mechanisms compared with the current clinically tested HDAC6 inhibitor ACY-1215. We first showed that FL is the most sensitive to HDAC6 inhibitor. We showed that combining A452 with ibrutinib led to the synergistic inhibition of cell growth and decreased viability of FL cells, as well as increased levels of apoptosis. Similar synergistic interactions occur in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells (DLBCL). Enhanced cell death is associated with AKT and ERK1/2 inactivation and increased DNA damage (induction of gammaH2A.X and reduction of pChk1/2). In addition, A452 downregulates c-Myc, an effect significantly enhanced by ibruninib. Although ACY-1215 is less potent than A452, it displays synergism with ibrutinib. Overall, our results suggest that A452 is more effective as an anticancer agent than ACY-1215 in FL. These findings suggest that a combination of HDAC6-selective inhibitor and ibrutinib is a potent therapeutic strategy for NHL including FL.","['Lee, Dong Hoon', 'Kim, Go Woon', 'Kwon, So Hee']","['Lee DH', 'Kim GW', 'Kwon SH']","['College of Pharmacy, Yonsei Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yonsei University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Integrated OMICS for Biomedical Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Yonsei Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yonsei University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Yonsei Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yonsei University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Integrated OMICS for Biomedical Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190227,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,,,2019/01/30 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2018/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.22983 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2019 Jun;58(6):944-956. doi: 10.1002/mc.22983.

In the in vivo setting, the antitumoral activity of drugs differs from their in vitro cytotoxicity, but their combination effects are more pronounced. MTX on its own does not display significant antitumoral activity, whereas PT reduces tumor growth in both L1210 and KB in vivo models.

In eukaryotes, RNA is polymerized by three distinct RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase I, II, and III (RNAP1, RNAP2, and RNAP3, respectively). The transcriptional machinery that initiates each transcription reaction has been purified and characterized. Selectivity factor 1 (SL1) is the complex responsible for RNAP1 pre-initiation complex formation. However, whether it plays any role in RNAP2-dependent transcription remains unclear. Our group previously found that SL1 specifically associates with AF4 family proteins. AF4 family proteins form the AEP complex with ENL family proteins and the P-TEFb elongation factor. Similar complexes have been independently characterized by several different laboratories and are often referred to as super elongation complex. The involvement of AEP in RNAP2-dependent transcription indicates that SL1 must play an important role in RNAP2-dependent transcription. To date, this role of SL1 has not been appreciated. In leukemia, AF4 and ENL family genes are frequently rearranged to form chimeric fusion genes with MLL. The resultant MLL fusion genes produce chimeric MLL fusion proteins comprising MLL and AEP components. The MLL portion functions as a targeting module, which specifically binds chromatin containing di-/tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 36 and non-methylated CpGs. This type of chromatin is enriched at the promoters of transcriptionally active genes which allows MLL fusion proteins to selectively bind to transcriptionally-active/CpG-rich gene promoters. The fusion partner portion, which recruits other AEP components and SL1, is responsible for activation of RNAP2-dependent transcription. Consequently, MLL fusion proteins constitutively activate the transcription of previously-transcribed MLL target genes. Structure/function analysis has shown that the ability of MLL fusion proteins to transform hematopoietic progenitors depends on the recruitment of AEP and SL1. Thus, the AEP/SL1-mediated gene activation pathway appears to be the central mechanism of MLL fusion-mediated transcriptional activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which SL1 activates RNAP2-dependent transcription remains largely unclear. This review aims to cover recent discoveries of the mechanism of transcriptional activation by MLL fusion proteins and to introduce novel roles of SL1 in RNAP2-dependent transcription by discussing how the RNAP1 machinery may be involved in RNAP2-dependent gene regulation.","['Yokoyama, Akihiko']",['Yokoyama A'],"['Tsuruoka Meatabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Yamagata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190114,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC6339877,,2019/01/30 06:00,2019/01/30 06:01,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2018.00722 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2019 Jan 14;9:722. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00722. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['AEP', 'DOT1L', 'MLL', 'RNA polymerase', 'SL1', 'leukemia', 'transcription']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ibrutinib is not curative, it has a profound effect on CLL cells and may create new pharmacologically exploitable vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, we developed a systematic approach that combines epigenome profiling (charting the gene-regulatory basis of cell state) with single-cell chemosensitivity profiling (quantifying cell-type-specific drug response) and bioinformatic data integration. By applying our method to a cohort of matched patient samples collected before and during ibrutinib therapy, we identified characteristic ibrutinib-induced changes that provide a starting point for the rational design of ibrutinib combination therapies. Specifically, we observed and validated preferential sensitivity to proteasome, PLK1, and mTOR inhibitors during ibrutinib treatment. More generally, our study establishes a broadly applicable method for investigating treatment-specific vulnerabilities by integrating the complementary perspectives of epigenetic cell states and phenotypic drug responses in primary patient samples.","['Schmidl, Christian', 'Vladimer, Gregory I', 'Rendeiro, Andre F', 'Schnabl, Susanne', 'Krausgruber, Thomas', 'Taubert, Christina', 'Krall,

ILEI expression levels are regulated through a non-canonical TGFbeta signaling pathway by 3'-UTR-mediated translational silencing at the mRNA level by hnRNP E1. TGFbeta stimulation or silencing of hnRNP E1 increases ILEI translation and induces an EMT program that correlates with enhanced invasion and migration. Recently, EMT has been linked to the formation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that confer both tumor cell heterogeneity as well as chemoresistant properties. Herein, we demonstrate that hnRNP E1 knockdown significantly shifts normal mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. We further validate that modulating ILEI protein levels results in the abrogation of these phenotypes, promoting further investigation into the unknown mechanism of ILEI signaling that drives tumor progression. We identify LIFR as the receptor for ILEI, which mediates signaling through STAT3 to drive both EMT and BCSC formation. Reduction of either ILEI or LIFR protein levels results in reduced tumor growth, fewer tumor initiating cells and reduced metastasis within the hnRNP E1 knock-down cell populations in vivo. These results reveal a novel ligand-receptor complex that drives the formation of BCSCs and represents a unique target for the development of metastatic breast cancer therapies.","['Woosley, Alec N', 'Dalton, Annamarie C', 'Hussey, George S', 'Howley, Breege V', 'Mohanty, Bidyut K', 'Grelet, Simon', 'Dincman, Toros', 'Bloos, Sean', 'Olsen, Shaun K', 'Howe, Philip H']","['Woosley AN', 'Dalton AC', 'Hussey GS', 'Howley BV', 'Mohanty BK', 'Grelet S', 'Dincman T', 'Bloos S', 'Olsen SK', 'Howe PH']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA. howep@musc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190128,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC6525020,,2019/01/30 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0703-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0703-z [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 May;38(20):3794-3811. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0703-z.

Based on these data, posttransplant lenalidomide is considered by many a standard-of-care in this setting. However, decisions on the use of new therapies should consider not only results of such trials and meta-analyses but also other factors including quality-of-evidence, anticipated desired and undesired effects of the drug, costs and feasibility of the therapy option. In this review, we critically analyzed evidence on posttransplant lenalidomide in PCM, and we identified criteria which should be considered in designating posttransplant lenalidomide the standard-of-care. Using Grading of Evidence, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach we judged posttransplant lenalidomide improves PFS with high-quality evidence. However, we identified inconsistency and imprecision as limitations in the conclusions regarding a survival benefit rating the quality-of-evidence for a survival benefit moderate. We also highlighted inconsistency in claims of an increased risk of new cancers associated with posttransplant lenalidomide. We emphasize the need for a value-based reasoning which considers PFS and survival as well as health-related quality-of-life and costs. We conclude the decision to use posttransplant lenalidomide should be individualized based on pre- and posttransplant variables such as remission state, risk category and/or posttransplant measurable residual disease (MRD)-test results. Validity of these variables in estimating benefits and risks of posttransplant lenalidomide should be tested in randomized clinical trials.","['Barosi, Giovanni', 'Gale, Robert Peter']","['Barosi G', 'Gale RP']","['Center for the Study of Myelofibrosis, IRCCS Policlinico S.

Knowledge of the mechanisms driving evolution from CH to overt malignancy has been hampered by a lack of in vivo models that orthogonally activate mutant alleles. Here, we develop independently regulatable mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a) and nucleophosmin 1 (Npm1), observed in human CH and AML, respectively. We find Dnmt3a mutation expands hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells (HSC/MPPs), modeling CH. Induction of mutant Npm1 after development of Dnmt3a-mutant CH causes progression to myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), and more aggressive MPD is observed with longer latency between mutations. MPDs uniformly progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following transplant, accompanied by a decrease in HSC/MPPs and an increase in myeloid-restricted progenitors, the latter of which propagate AML in tertiary recipient mice. At a molecular level, progression of CH to MPD is accompanied by selection for mutations activating Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling. Progression to AML is characterized by additional oncogenic signaling mutations (Ptpn11, Pik3r1, Flt3) and/or mutations in epigenetic regulators (Hdac1, Idh1, Arid1a).

The resected specimen revealed NET-G2 tumorof the pancreatic head(Ki-67 proliferation index 5.0%)and hepatic metastasis(Ki-67 index 2.2%). Although CDDP/ETP(PE)and everolimus(AfinitorTM)regimen were started postoperatively, PE was discontinued due to bone marrow suppression. As the liver metastasis stayed SD for 4 months by everolimus single therapy, 6 hepatic metastases were resected for curative intent 5 months postoperatively. Thereafter, multiple liver metastases appeared 10 months after the metastasectomy. Everolimus single therapy was restarted. As the metastases were maintained SD for 4 months, repeat hepatectomy was performed for curative intent after right portal vein embolization. Multimodality therapy including repeat metastasectomy should be considered for selected patients with P-NET G2 with liver metastases for prolonged survival, if the operation can be performed with low perioperative morbidity.","['Inaba, Yoko', 'Hongo, Maiko', 'Ninomiya, Riki', 'Nakazawa, Akiko', 'Hashimoto, Daijyo']","['Inaba Y', 'Hongo M', 'Ninomiya R', 'Nakazawa A', 'Hashimoto D']","['Dept. of Gastroenterological Surgery, Sano City Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Idelalisib is a highly selective PI3K (PI3Kdelta) isoform-specific inhibitor effective in relapsed/refractory CLL and follicular lymphoma. However, severe autoimmune adverse effects in association with the use of idelalisib in the treatment of CLL, particularly as a first-line therapy, gave indications that idelalisib may preferentially target the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). On this background, we examined the effect of idelalisib on the function of human Tregs ex vivo with respect to proliferation, TCR signaling, phenotype, and suppressive function. Our results show that human Tregs are highly susceptible to PI3Kdelta inactivation using idelalisib compared with CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells (Teffs) as evident from effects on anti-CD3/CD28/CD2-induced proliferation (order of susceptibility [IC50]: Treg [.5 muM] > CD4(+) Teff [2.0 muM] > CD8(+) Teff [6.5 muM]) and acting at the level of AKT and NF-kappaB phosphorylation. Moreover, idelalisib treatment of Tregs altered their phenotype and reduced their suppressive function against CD4(+) and CD8(+) Teffs. Phenotyping Tregs from CLL patients treated with idelalisib supported our in vitro findings. Collectively, our data show that human Tregs are more dependent on PI3Kdelta-mediated signaling compared with CD4(+) and CD8(+) Teffs. This Treg-preferential effect could explain why idelalisib produces adverse autoimmune effects by breaking Treg-mediated tolerance. However, balancing effects on Treg sensitivity versus CD8(+) Teff insensitivity to idelalisib could still potentially be exploited to enhance inherent antitumor immune responses in patients.","['Chellappa, Stalin', 'Kushekhar, Kushi', 'Munthe, Ludvig A', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E', 'Aandahl, Einar M', 'Okkenhaug, Klaus', 'Tasken, Kjetil']","['Chellappa S', 'Kushekhar K', 'Munthe LA', 'Tjonnfjord GE', 'Aandahl EM', 'Okkenhaug K', 'Tasken K']","['Department for Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, N-0424 Oslo, Norway.', 'K.G.

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is involved in the generation of NAD(+) and a potential therapeutic target in AML. We evaluated the effect of KPT-9274, a p21-activated kinase 4/NAMPT inhibitor that possesses a unique NAMPT-binding profile based on in silico modeling compared with earlier compounds pursued against this target. KPT-9274 elicited loss of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in AML subtypes independent of mutations and genomic abnormalities. These actions occurred mainly through the depletion of NAD(+), whereas genetic knockdown of p21-activated kinase 4 did not induce cytotoxicity in AML cell lines or influence the cytotoxic effect of KPT-9274. KPT-9274 exposure reduced colony formation, increased blast differentiation, and diminished the frequency of leukemia-initiating cells from primary AML samples; KPT-9274 was minimally cytotoxic toward normal hematopoietic or immune cells. In addition, KPT-9274 improved overall survival in vivo in 2 different mouse models of AML and reduced tumor development in a patient-derived xenograft model of AML. Overall, KPT-9274 exhibited broad preclinical activity across a variety of AML subtypes and warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for AML.","['Mitchell, Shaneice R', 'Larkin, Karilyn', 'Grieselhuber, Nicole R', 'Lai, Tzung-Huei', 'Cannon, Matthew', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Sharma, Pratibha', 'Asemelash, Yerdanose', 'Zhang, Pu', 'Goettl, Virginia M', 'Beaver, Larry', 'Mims, Alice', 'Puduvalli, Vinay K', 'Blachly, James S', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Harrington, Bonnie', 'Henderson, Sally', 'Breitbach, Justin T', 'Williams, Katie E', 'Dong, Shuai', 'Baloglu, Erkan', 'Senapedis, William', 'Kirschner, Karl', 'Sampath, Deepa', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Byrd, John C']","['Mitchell SR', 'Larkin K', 'Grieselhuber NR', 'Lai TH', 'Cannon M', 'Orwick S', 'Sharma P', 'Asemelash Y', 'Zhang P', 'Goettl VM', 'Beaver L', 'Mims A', 'Puduvalli VK', 'Blachly JS', 'Lehman A', 'Harrington B', 'Henderson S', 'Breitbach JT', 'Williams KE', 'Dong S', 'Baloglu E', 'Senapedis W', 'Kirschner K', 'Sampath D', 'Lapalombella R', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Neuro-oncology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Neuro-oncology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Center for Biostatistics, and.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA.', 'Departments of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Technical Journalism, Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Sankt Augustin, Germany; and.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC6373756,,2019/01/30 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2018/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018024182 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024182 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Feb 12;3(3):242-255. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024182.,,,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM068412/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA223165/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 OD010429/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9297-781X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1898-9836', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3495-5932', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8396-9500', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4275-5562', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2658-6188', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2434-2430', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4581-920X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6916-9400']",,,20200319,IM,"['Acrylamides/*pharmacology', 'Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KPT-9274)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)']",,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because targeting HR-defective cancers with PARP inhibition (PARPi) has yielded clinical benefit, improved understanding of HR defects is needed to implement this treatment modality. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used an ex vivo irradiation-based assay to evaluate HR repair, HR gene promoter methylation, and mRNA expression in primary myeloid neoplastic cells. In vitro BRCA1 gene silencing was achieved to determine the consequences on HR repair, sensitivity to PARPi, and expression of miR-155, an oncogenic miRNA. RESULTS: Impaired HR repair was frequently detected in myeloid neoplasm samples (9/21, 43%) and was linked to promoter methylation-mediated transcriptional repression of BRCA1, which was not observed for other members of the HR pathway (BRCA2, ATM, ATR, FANC-A). In vitro BRCA1 knockdown increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition, and BRCA1 expression is inversely correlated with miR-155 expression, a finding reproduced in vitro with BRCA1 knockdown. Increased miR-155 was associated with PU.1 and SHIP1 repression, known myeloid differentiation factors that are frequently downregulated during leukemic transformation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates frequent defective HR, associated with BRCA1 epigenetic silencing, in a broad range of myeloid neoplasms. The increased prevalence of BRCA1 promoter methylation, resulting in repressed BRCA1, may have an additional role in leukemogenesis by increasing miR-155 expression, which then inhibits transcription factors associated with normal myeloid differentiation. Further study of HR defects may facilitate the identification of HR-defective myeloid neoplasms sensitive to PARPi.","['Poh, Weijie', 'Dilley, Robert L', 'Moliterno, Alison R', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Herman, James G']","['Poh W', 'Dilley RL', 'Moliterno AR', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Pratz KW', 'McDevitt MA', 'Herman JG']","['Graduate Program in Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic/Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Graduate Program in Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland. hermanj3@upmc.edu.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190128,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,,2019/01/30 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2019/01/30 06:00'],"['2018/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-0179 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0179 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Apr 15;25(8):2513-2522. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0179.

This phenomenon has been observed in populations across the globe and, while virtually non-existent in children is estimated to affect >10% of the 70-and-older age group. The mutations are thought to occur in stem cells, which makes them pre-cancerous, and precursors to cancer stem cells. Many of the genes most commonly mutated in clonal hematopoiesis are also recurrently mutated in leukemia, genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, JAK2, and TP53. However, between 40% and 60% of cases arise from the accumulation of what appear to be random mutations outside of known driver genes. Clonal hematopoiesis is frequently present in otherwise healthy individuals and may persist for many years. Though largely asymptomatic, carrying these somatic mutations confers a small but significantly increased risk of leukemic transformation, affecting 0.5-1% carriers per year; although most genes confer an increased risk of transformation, mutations in TP53 and U2AF1 appear to carry a particularly high risk for transformation. Additionally, a patient's history of prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation are correlated with the development of clonal hematopoiesis; in the setting of chemotherapy treatment of solid tumors, hematopoietic mutations in TP53 and PPM1D appear to contribute to outgrowth of clones that may lead to subsequent malignancy. The presence of a clone also imparts a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which in some cases appears to be due to increased inflammation and atherosclerosis. Clonal hematopoiesis is correlated with several other diseases as well, including diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and aplastic anemia, with other associations probably yet to be uncovered.","['Silver, Alexander J', 'Jaiswal, Siddhartha']","['Silver AJ', 'Jaiswal S']","['Medical Scientist Training Program, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.

The bone marrow microenvironment (BME) and its immune and other supporting cells are regarded to facilitate the survival, differentiation and proliferation of leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which enables AML cells to persist and expand despite treatment. Recent studies have identified epigenetic modifications among AML cells and BME constituents in AML, and have shown that epigenetic therapy can potentially reprogram these alterations. In this review, we summarize the interactions between the BME and LSCs, and discuss changes in how the BME and immune cells interact with AML cells. After describing the epigenetic modifications seen across chromatin, DNA, the BME, and the immune microenvironment, we explore how demethylating agents may reprogram these pathological interactions, and potentially re-sensitize AML cells to treatment.","['Kogan, Aksinija A', 'Lapidus, Rena G', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Rassool, Feyruz V']","['Kogan AA', 'Lapidus RG', 'Baer MR', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States; University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, United States; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, United States; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States; University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, United States.

Seven days after the initial visit, the dog died and was submitted for necropsy examination. Grossly, the bone marrow was red in colour and hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with discolouration were observed. A bone marrow smear showed an increased proportion of basophilic lineage cells. Histologically, the bone marrow showed high cellular density and numerous basophilic lineage cells with a round or segmented nucleus. The cytoplasm contained basophilic granules exhibiting metachromasia on toluidine blue staining. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic basophils were diffusely positive for vimentin and myeloperoxidase, but negative for CD3, BLA36, CD163, CD204 and c-kit. The immunohistochemical features of neoplastic basophils that had invaded the liver and spleen were similar to those of the basophils in the bone marrow.

Immunopositivity for FeLV was observed in 56.6% (30/53) of the samples. FeLV positivity was equally distributed between the genders, but predominated in junior and prime cats. The degree of association between lymphoma and FeLV infection in Brazil was higher than that found in other countries, demonstrating the need to prevent and control the factors associated with infection.","['Cristo, T G', 'Biezus, G', 'Noronha, L F', 'Pereira, L H H S', 'Withoeft, J A', 'Furlan, L V', 'Costa, L S', 'Traverso, S D', 'Casagrande, R A']","['Cristo TG', 'Biezus G', 'Noronha LF', 'Pereira LHHS', 'Withoeft JA', 'Furlan LV', 'Costa LS', 'Traverso SD', 'Casagrande RA']","['Laboratory of Animal Pathology, Agroveterinary Sciences Center, Brazil; Postgraduate Program in Animal Science, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Animal Pathology, Agroveterinary Sciences Center, Brazil; Postgraduate Program in Animal Science, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Animal Pathology, Agroveterinary Sciences Center, Brazil; Student of Veterinary Medicine, University of Santa Catarina State, Av.

METHODS: The original HITS plan was revised for different regimens, i.e. HEARTS, low-dose HEARTS and SIB-HEARTS. The uniformity index (UI), conformity index (CI), and dose of organs at risk (OARs) were used to evaluate the plans. Additionally, the SIB-HEART (21/15 Gy) was delivered to the total skin and chloromas. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed for the CI and UI between HITS and HEARTS regimens. Compared with HITS, the reduced mean doses to various bone marrows ranged from 17 to 88%. The mean OARs doses for the head, chest and abdomen of a patient with AML treated with SIB-HEARTS (21/15 Gy) were 2.1 to 21.9 Gy, 1.8 to 7.8 Gy and 1.7 to 3.3 Gy, respectively. No severe adverse effects were noted except for grade 4 leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: HEARTS and different regimens reduced the dose to OARs and bone marrow while maintaining the uniformity and conformity. SIB-HEARTS deliveries different doses to the total skin and enlarged tumors simultaneously.

This study examined the contribution of GHD to functional outcomes while adjusting for cranial radiation therapy (CRT). METHODS: Adult survivors of ALL (N = 571; 49% female; mean age, 37.4 years; age range, 19.4-62.2 years) completed neurocognitive tests and self-reported neurocognitive symptoms, emotional distress, and quality of life. GHD was defined as a previous diagnosis of GHD or a plasma insulin-like growth factor1 level less than -2.0 standard deviations for sex and age at the time of neurocognitive testing. Hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, sex, age at diagnosis, CRT dose, and intrathecal and high-dose intravenous methotrexate were included as covariates in multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Of the 571 survivors, 298 (52%) had GHD, and those with GHD received higher doses of CRT (P = .002). Survivors who had GHD, irrespective of prior growth hormone treatment, demonstrated poorer vocabulary (z-score, -0.84 vs -0.61; P = .02), processing speed (z-score, -0.49 vs -0.30; P = .04), cognitive flexibility (z-score, -1.37 vs -0.94; P = .01), and verbal fluency (z-score, -0.74 vs -0.44; P = .001), and they self-reported more neurocognitive problems and poorer quality of life compared with survivors who did not have GHD. Multivariable and mediation models revealed that GHD was associated with small effects on quality of life (general health, P = .01; vitality, P = .01; mental health, P = .01); and CRT dose accounted for the lower neurocognitive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood ALL who receive CRT are at risk for GHD, although poor neurocognitive outcomes are determined by CRT dose and not by the presence of GHD.","['Krull, Kevin R', 'Li, Chenghong', 'Phillips, Nicholas S', 'Cheung, Yin Ting', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Wilson, Carmen L', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Merchant, Thomas E', 'Sabin, Noah D', 'Srivastava, DeoKumar', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Chemaitilly, Wassim']","['Krull KR', 'Li C', 'Phillips NS', 'Cheung YT', 'Brinkman TM', 'Wilson CL', 'Armstrong GT', 'Khan RB', 'Merchant TE', 'Sabin ND', 'Srivastava D', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Sklar CA', 'Chemaitilly W']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR, China.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pediatric Medicine, Division of Neurology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Radiation Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pediatric Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190128,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC6486430,,2019/01/29 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2018/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31975 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 May 15;125(10):1748-1755. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31975.

Recent biological and pharmacological studies have enabled linking of the BET bromodomains with diseases, including inflammation and cancer, suggesting that bromodomains are druggable targets. In this study, we made further structural modifications of our previously reported BRD4 inhibitors, to develop new chemical scaffold 3-Hydroxyisoindolin-1-One. Then a series of compounds (10a-q) were synthesized via palladium-catalyzed CH activation and BRD4-inhibitory activities and anti-proliferative effects of these compounds were evaluated. Compound 10e exhibited excellent BRD4-inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 80nM and anti-proliferation potency with IC50 value of 365nM in HL-60 (humanpromyelocytic leukemia) cancer cell lines. We have demonstrated compound 10e modulated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, these results suggested that compound 10e could be utilized as a BRD4 inhibitor for further leukemia treatment.","['Chen, Pan', 'Yang, Yifei', 'Yang, Lingyun', 'Tian, Jiping', 'Zhang, Fangqing', 'Zhou, Jinpei', 'Zhang, Huibin']","['Chen P', 'Yang Y', 'Yang L', 'Tian J', 'Zhang F', 'Zhou J', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'Center of Drug Discovery, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'Center of Drug Discovery, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'Center of Drug Discovery, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, PR China.

Treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA) was introduced between 2004 and 2006 but its impact on population-based survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological characteristics and survival before and after introduction of HMA treatment. METHODS: We performed a population-based analysis of CMML cases reported to the Cantonal Cancer Registries in Switzerland (SWISS) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from the United States for 1999-2006 (before HMA) and 2007-2014 (after HMA). Time trends were compared for these two time periods. RESULTS: 423 and 4144 new CMML cases were reported to the SWISS and SEER registries, respectively. We observed an increasing proportion of older patients >/=75 years in the SWISS (50.3%-62.3%) compared to a decreasing one in the SEER population (59.1%-55.1%). Age standardized incidence-rates were similar and remained stable in both countries (0.32-0.38 per 100'000 py). Relative survival (RS) improved significantly in the SEER (3 years 27%-37%; 5 years 19%-23%; p < 0.001 for both) but remained stable in the SWISS population (3 years 48% to 40%; 5 years 34% to 26%; n.s. for both). CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of opposing age-trends, epidemiologic characteristics are similar in both countries and comparable to other population-based registries. RS remains poor and different time trends of population-based survival cannot be faithfully explained by HMA but most likely by changes in diagnostic accuracy within prognostically distinct age-groups.","['Benzarti, Sonia', 'Daskalakis, Michael', 'Feller, Anita', 'Bacher, Vera Ulrike', 'Schnegg-Kaufmann, Annatina', 'Rufer, Axel', 'Holbro, Andreas', 'Schmidt, Adrian', 'Benz, Rudolf', 'Solenthaler, Max', 'Stussi, Georg', 'Arndt, Volker', 'Bonadies, Nicolas']","['Benzarti S', 'Daskalakis M', 'Feller A', 'Bacher VU', 'Schnegg-Kaufmann A', 'Rufer A', 'Holbro A', 'Schmidt A', 'Benz R', 'Solenthaler M', 'Stussi G', 'Arndt V', 'Bonadies N']","['Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Foundation National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER) c/o University of Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department for BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Cantonal Hospital Lucerne, Switzerland.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Medical Oncology and Hematology, City Hospital Triemli Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Oncology/Hematology, Cantonal Hospital Muensterlingen, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Oncology/Hematology, Cantonal Hospital Thun, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Switzerland.', 'Foundation National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER) c/o University of Zurich, Switzerland; Unit of Cancer Survivorship, Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department for BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Switzerland.

Three isoforms of PPAR named PPARalpha, PPARbeta/delta, and PPARgamma have been described, each encoded by a separate gene: PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG, respectively. In the present study, we examined the profiles of PPAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR; PPAR heterodimer partner) mRNA expression and PPAR DNA binding activity in porcine trophoblast tissue collected on days 15, 20, 25, and 30 of pregnancy and in day-20 embryos. Placenta trophoblast cells isolated on day 25 of pregnancy were used to determine effects of (1) cytokines on PPAR and RXR mRNA expression and (2) PPAR agonists on prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis and the expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis, fatty acid binding, and PG transport, as well as on cell proliferation. The mRNA expression of PPARA and RXRB was greater in trophoblast tissue collected on days 25 and 30 of pregnancy compared with day 15 (P < 0.05), while DNA binding activity of PPARalpha decreased between day 15 and 25 (P < 0.05). Increased concentrations of PPARD and RXRA transcripts were observed in trophoblasts collected on day 20 compared to trophoblasts from days 15 and 30 (P < 0.05). Moreover, concentrations of DNA-bound PPARbeta/delta and PPARgamma proteins increased in day-30 trophoblasts compared to day 15 (P < 0.01) and day 20 (P < 0.05), respectively. On day 20 of gestation, the mRNA expression of PPARD, PPARG, and RXRA and protein levels of PPARalpha and PPARgamma isoforms were greater in trophoblast than embryonic tissue (P < 0.01). Interleukin 1beta and/or interferon gamma, but not IL6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, upregulated PPAR and RXR mRNA expression in placenta trophoblast cells in vitro (P < 0.05). Rosiglitazone (a PPARgamma agonist) stimulated prostaglandin E synthase mRNA expression in trophoblast cells and PGE2 accumulation in incubation medium (P < 0.05). Moreover, activation of PPAR isoforms differentially affected the expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis, fatty acid binding, and PG transport in studied cells. Finally, PPARalpha and PPARgamma agonists stimulated trophoblast cell proliferation (P < 0.05), and this effect was abolished by the addition of a respective PPAR antagonist (P < 0.05). Overall, these results point to a role of PPAR isoforms in porcine placenta development and function.","['Blitek, A', 'Szymanska, M']","['Blitek A', 'Szymanska M']","['Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Tuwima 10, 10-748 Olsztyn, Poland.

Traditional diagnosis of AML depends on invasive bone marrow biopsies. To recognize the metabolic characteristics related with AML and search for early non-invasive biomarkers of AML, in this work we applied ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOFMS)-based metabolomoc method to profile serum metabolites from 55 de novo AML patients and 45 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects and to screen and validate AML biomarkers. We observed AML-related metabolic differences mainly involved in alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; d-Glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; and phenylalanine metabolism as well as fatty acid metabolism. A serum metabolite biomarker panel consisting of glutamic acid, kynurenine and oleic acid was defined and validated based on binary logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) analysis, yielding an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.981 with 0.975 sensitivity and 0.933 specificity in the discovery set and an AUC of 0.973 with 0.933 sensitivity and 0.933 specificity in the validation set. This work demonstrated the UHPLC- MS-based metabolomics as a low invasive potential tool for the detection of AML, and this composite serum metabolite panel exhibited good diagnostic performance for AML in this case-control study and deserved further validation in a large-scale clinical trial. The identified metabolic pathways were also potentially worthy of further studying the pathogenesis of AML.","['Wang, Dong', 'Tan, Guangguo', 'Wang, Haibo', 'Chen, Peng', 'Hao, Jie', 'Wang, Yanyu']","['Wang D', 'Tan G', 'Wang H', 'Chen P', 'Hao J', 'Wang Y']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Beidaihe Rehabilitation and Sanatorium Center, Joint Logistics Support Force of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Qinhuangdao, 066100, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, China.

Nevertheless, the toxicity of deoxynivalenol on ISCs and its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. As pigs are the most sensitive animals to deoxynivalenol, we used piglets for investigation in this study. Here, we show that intestinal epithelial cell activity, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) protein level, and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity were suppressed with acute expose to deoxynivalenol. We further established a novel system for porcine crypt isolation and ex vivo cultivation. Crypts and crypt cells expanded and budded with typical enteroid morphologies under this system. Our results show that both acute in vivo and in vitro administration of deoxynivalenol significantly decreased enteroid activity. Simultaneously, protein levels of beta-catenin and leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) in enteroids were reduced by deoxynivalenol exposure. In conclusion, we established a reliable culture system for porcine enteroids and demonstrated for the first time that the activity of ISCs and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is sensitively suppressed by acute deoxynivalenol exposure.","['Li, Xiang-Guang', 'Zhu, Min', 'Chen, Ming-Xia', 'Fan, Hong-Bo', 'Fu, Hou-Long', 'Zhou, Jia-Yi', 'Zhai, Zhen-Ya', 'Gao, Chun-Qi', 'Yan, Hui-Chao', 'Wang, Xiu-Qi']","['Li XG', 'Zhu M', 'Chen MX', 'Fan HB', 'Fu HL', 'Zhou JY', 'Zhai ZY', 'Gao CQ', 'Yan HC', 'Wang XQ']","['College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China; Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'Guangdong Vocational College of Science and Trade, Guangzhou 510430, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University/Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition Control/National Engineering Research Center for Breeding Swine Industry, Guangzhou 510642, China.

However, translational control of RUNX1 expression has not been fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that RUNX1b mRNA is translated from two alternative initiation sites, Met-1 and Met-25, giving full-length RUNX1b and a shorter protein lacking the first 24 amino acids (RUNX1DeltaN24). Presence/absence of strong Kozak consensus sequences around Met-1 determines which initiation site is mainly used in RUNX1b cDNA. Selective disruption of either Met-1 or Met-25 abrogates expression of the corresponding protein while facilitating the production of another protein. The RUNX1b cDNA containing 65bp natural promoter sequences mainly produces full-length RUNX1b in human cord blood cells, but disruption of Met-1 in this cDNA also induced translation from Met-25. Consistent with these data, disruption of endogenous RUNX1b around Met-1 using CRISPR/Cas9 induced selective expression of RUNX1DeltaNu24 in several leukemia cell lines. RUNX1DeltaN24 protein is more stable than full-length RUNX1b and retains hematopoietic activity. We also found that FLAG-tagged full-length RUNX1 showed altered activity, indicating the influence of N-terminal FLAG-tag on RUNX1 function. The alternative translation initiation of RUNX1b may participate in fine tuning RUNX1 activity.","['Goyama, Susumu', 'Schibler, Janet', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Goyama S', 'Schibler J', 'Mulloy JC']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Previous research suggests that the presence of multiple distinct cancer clones is associated with clinical outcome. Detection of clonal heterogeneity from high throughput data, such as sequencing or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data, is important for gaining a better understanding of cancer and may improve prediction of clinical outcome or response to treatment. Here, we present a new method, CloneSeeker, for inferring clinical heterogeneity from sequencing data, SNP array data, or both. RESULTS: We generated simulated SNP array and sequencing data and applied CloneSeeker along with two other methods. We demonstrate that CloneSeeker is more accurate than existing algorithms at determining the number of clones, distribution of cancer cells among clones, and mutation and/or copy numbers belonging to each clone. Next, we applied CloneSeeker to SNP array data from samples of 258 previously untreated CLL patients to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of CLL tumors and to elucidate the relationship between clonal heterogeneity and clinical outcome. We found that a significant majority of CLL patients appear to have multiple clones distinguished by copy number alterations alone. We also found that the presence of multiple clones corresponded with significantly worse survival among CLL patients. These findings may prove useful for improving the accuracy of prognosis and design of treatment strategies.

Years since diagnosis was inversely associated with making contact. Nonwhite race and age >/=60 years had lower odds of cooperation. Study features with lower odds of cooperation included longitudinal design (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.61) and study brochures (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.90).

Step-down test and Y-type maze test were utilized to examine the learning and memory abilities of the mice. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting techniques were adopted to measure the levels of apoptosis-related genes [B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), C-caspase-3 and T-caspase-3] in the brain tissues of mice. Terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was applied to detect the apoptosis of neuronal cells in the brain tissues. Meanwhile, the levels of oxidative stress markers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), gp91 and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured. Finally, the expression level of TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway was detected. RESULTS: The latency in the step-down test in the WT + CSVD group was remarkably longer than that in the Control group, and the number of errors was evidently larger than that in the Control group (p < 0.05). At the same time, in the WT + CSVD group, the expression levels of pro-apoptotic genes Bax and C-caspase-3 were up-regulated markedly, while the expression level of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 declined notably (p < 0.05). TUNEL results showed that the number of apoptotic cells in the brain tissues in the WT + CSVD group was about 12 times that in the Control group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the SOD expression level was lowered, and the MDA expression level was elevated in the brain tissues in the WT + CSVD group. In addition, the TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway was prominently activated in the mice in the WT + CSVD group (p < 0.05). After TLR4 gene knockout, the cognitive functions of the mice were improved markedly, and the apoptosis of neuronal cells and oxidative stress in the brain tissues were suppressed significantly in the meantime. Moreover, the activation of the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway was also inhibited. CONCLUSION: The TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway is involved in the occurrence and development of CSVD-induced cognitive impairment through regulating oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.","['Zhang, Yi', 'Wu, Ruipeng', 'Gu, Cheng', 'Gao, Fulin', 'Hu, Xiaojuan', 'Zang, Peixi', 'Dong, Tong']","['Zhang Y', 'Wu R', 'Gu C', 'Gao F', 'Hu X', 'Zang P', 'Dong T']","['Department of Neurology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,9709206,,,2019/01/29 06:00,2019/11/14 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['CH180515 [pii]', '10.3233/CH-180515 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc. 2019;72(2):201-210. doi: 10.3233/CH-180515.,['NOTNLM'],"['CSVD', 'TLR4/NF-kappaB', 'cognitive impairment']",,,,,,20191113,IM,"['Animals', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism', 'Vascular Diseases/*genetics/pathology']","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examinations of the possibility of reducing therapeutic intensity may thus be explored. This prospective study examined outcomes in 205 pediatric patients with ETV6-RUNX1-positive B-ALL uniformly treated following the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study Group (JACLS) ALL-02 protocol. The JACLS ALL-02 protocol does not employ minimal residual disease detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR-MRD)-based risk stratification; however, 4-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 94.4 +/- 1.6 and 97.5 +/- 1.1%, respectively. In particular, 92 of 205 (44.9%) patients were successfully treated with a less intensive regimen involving only two cycles of high dose methotrexate and one course of re-induction therapy comprising vincristine, L-asparaginase (L-asp), pirarubicin, and prednisolone. Multivariate analysis revealed that discontinuation of L-asp and poor response to prednisolone was, respectively, associated with poor EFS (HR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3-27.0) and OS (HR 17.5; 95% CI 2.3-130), suggesting that the majority of ETV6-RUNX1-positive B-ALL cases may be cured by a less-intensive chemotherapy regimen if the risk stratification system including PCR-MRD monitoring and insufficient use of L-asp is avoided.","['Usami, Ikuya', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Takahashi, Yoshihiro', 'Suenobu, So-Ichi', 'Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Deguchi, Takao', 'Hori, Tsukasa', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Kato, Koji', 'Ito, Eturou', 'Moriya-Saito, Akiko', 'Kawasaki, Hirohide', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Yumura-Yagi, Keiko', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Sato, Atsushi', 'Horibe, Keizo']","['Usami I', 'Imamura T', 'Takahashi Y', 'Suenobu SI', 'Hasegawa D', 'Hashii Y', 'Deguchi T', 'Hori T', 'Shimada A', 'Kato K', 'Ito E', 'Moriya-Saito A', 'Kawasaki H', 'Hori H', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Hara J', 'Sato A', 'Horibe K']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hyogo Prefectural Amagasaki General Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan. imamura@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. imamura@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan.', 'Division of General Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hyogo Prefectural Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Medical University of Medicine, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.', 'Yumura Clinic, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Sendai, Japan."", 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190128,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/01/29 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2018/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02599-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02599-w [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Apr;109(4):477-482. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02599-w.

Moreover, we review the latest literature on how to treat plasma cell leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Plasma cell leukemia is clinically and genetically distinct from multiple myeloma. Plasma cell leukemia is defined by the observation in blood of more than 20% clonal plasma cells by differential count of the leucocytes or by counting more than 2 x 10(9) per liter circulating clonal plasma cells. However, patients with lower levels of circulating plasma cells have the same adverse prognosis, which challenges the disease definition. Survival has improved after implementation of high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support, bortezomib, and lenalidomide in the treatment; yet, the prognosis remains poor. The results of allo-transplants have been disappointing. The diagnostic criteria of PCL are currently discussed in the international myeloma community. Despite some improvement in survival, the prognosis remains adverse. New, more targeted treatment modalities, including immunotherapies, will hopefully improve the outcome in the near future.","['Gundesen, Michael Tveden', 'Lund, Thomas', 'Moeller, Hanne E H', 'Abildgaard, Niels']","['Gundesen MT', 'Lund T', 'Moeller HEH', 'Abildgaard N']","['Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Kloevervaenget 10, 12th floor, DK-5000, Odense C, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Kloevervaenget 10, 12th floor, DK-5000, Odense C, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, JP Winslovs vej 15, 2th floor, DK-5000, Odense C, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Kloevervaenget 10, 12th floor, DK-5000, Odense C, Denmark. niels.abildgaard@rsyd.dk.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. niels.abildgaard@rsyd.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190128,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,PMC6349791,,2019/01/29 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-019-0754-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-019-0754-x [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2019 Jan 28;21(1):8. doi: 10.1007/s11912-019-0754-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytogenetics', '*Diagnosis', '*Molecular biology', '*Plasma cell leukemia', '*Prognosis', '*Treatment']",,,,,,20200320,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to increased glucose levels, insulin is secreted, and several studies have shown that insulin-induced AKT signaling can regulate tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. The AKT pathway is aberrantly activated in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the mechanisms underlying this activation and its impact in pediatric patients with ALL are unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the insulin-induced chemoresistance and AKT pathway activation by measuring cell proliferation, apoptosis, and other parameters in ALL cell lines (Jurkat and Reh cells), as well as in primary pediatric leukemic cell samples, after culture with insulin, the chemotherapeutic drugs daunorubicin (DNR), vincristine (VCR), and L-asparaginase (L-Asp), or anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: DNR, VCR, and L-Asp-induced toxicity in Jurkat and Reh cells was reduced in the presence of insulin. DNR promoted cell proliferation, whereas DNR, VCR, and L-Asp all reduced apoptosis in both cell lines cotreated with insulin compared with that in cell lines treated with chemotherapeutics alone (P<0.05). Furthermore, addition of an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody promoted apoptosis, downregulated IGF-1R expression, and decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, P70S6K, and mTOR intracellular signaling pathway proteins in both cell lines, as well as in primary cultures (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that insulin-induced chemoresistance and activation of the AKT signaling pathway in pediatric ALL cells.","['Wang, Jian', 'Xue, Hong-Man', 'Chen, Yan-Ru', 'Xu, Hong-Gui', 'Lin, Shao-Fen', 'Tang, Xi-Kang', 'Chen, Chun']","['Wang J', 'Xue HM', 'Chen YR', 'Xu HG', 'Lin SF', 'Tang XK', 'Chen C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou.', 'Department of Pediatrics, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou.', 'Department of Pediatrics, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,2019/01/29 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001425 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Mar;41(2):96-104. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001425.,,,,,,,,20190514,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1', 'Receptors, Somatomedin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (IGF1R protein, human)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A regular practice of physical activity and a good cardiorespiratory fitness have the potential to reduce the risk of chronic disease and improve quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate in a cohort of ALL survivors, the association between a good cardiorespiratory fitness or the respect of physical activity guidelines and major long-term health outcomes. METHODS: In total, 247 ALL survivors underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test, completed a physical activity questionnaire and a battery of clinical examinations. We calculated the odds ratio to obtain the preventive fraction (PF) to evaluate the effects of the cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels on health outcomes (ie, obesity, metabolic health, cardiac health, cognitive health and mood, bone health). RESULTS: Despite their young age, 88% of the participants presented at least one adverse health outcome, and 46% presented >/=3. Their cardiorespiratory fitness was also lower than expected with a median VO2 peak reaching 84% of the predicted value. In the analyses using cardiorespiratory fitness, statistically significant PFs were observed for obesity (0.30), low-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (0.21) and depression (0.26). In the physical activity level analyses, statistically significant PFs were observed for obesity, depression, and low bone mineral density, with a PF of 0.55, 0.81, and 0.60, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a good cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity level induced a preventive action for most health outcomes studied and was associated with a lower late adverse effects prevalence in ALL survivors.","['Lemay, Valerie', 'Caru, Maxime', 'Samoilenko, Mariia', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Alos, Nathalie', 'Lefebvre, Genevieve', 'Levy, Emile', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Marcil, Valerie', 'Sultan, Serge', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Raboisson, Marie-Josee', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Andelfinger, Gregor', 'Curnier, Daniel']","['Lemay V', 'Caru M', 'Samoilenko M', 'Drouin S', 'Alos N', 'Lefebvre G', 'Levy E', 'Lippe S', 'Marcil V', 'Sultan S', 'Bertout L', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Raboisson MJ', 'Sinnett D', 'Andelfinger G', 'Curnier D']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430-Clinique Psychanalyse Developement (CliPsyD), Department of Psychology, University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Department of Mathematics, Universite du Quebec a Montreal.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Mathematics, Universite du Quebec a Montreal.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Nutrition.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Nutrition.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pharmacology.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,2019/01/29 06:00,2020/04/11 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001426 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;41(7):e450-e458. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001426.,,,,,,,,20200410,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Cardiorespiratory Fitness/*physiology', 'Child', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are still limited data about distribution of acute viral respiratory infections in children with cancer. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to evaluate the viral etiology and seasonality of acute viral respiratory infection in pediatric patients with cancer in a 3-year study. Our second aim was to evaluate the impact of viral infections on delaying the patients' chemotherapy or radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2014 to July 2017. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in patients younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated in the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department of Dr. Behcet Uz Children's Hospital with real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed to determine the frequency and seasonality of infections. The chi or the Fisher exact tests were used. RESULTS: A total of 219 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates and blood were analyzed. The mean patient age was 76.8+/-59.3 months, with 46.3% female and 53.7% male children in a total of 108 patients. Of this total, 55% (60/108 cases) had multiple acute respiratory infections. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (48.1%) was the most prevalent disease. The 3 most prevalent viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV) (33.1%), parainfluenza (PI) (18.7%), and coronavirus (CoV) (14.8%). In terms of the seasonal distribution of viruses, PI was most common in winter 2014, HRV in spring 2014, HRV in fall 2014, PI in winter 2015 and summer 2015, CoV in spring 2015, HRV in fall 2015, both influenza and HRV in winter 2016, both human metapneumovirus and bocavirus in spring 2016, HRV in summer 2016, both HRV and PI in fall 2016, both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in winter 2017, HRV in spring 2017, and both HRV and adenovirus in summer 2017. The mean duration of neutropenia for patients with viral respiratory infection was 17.1+/-13.8 (range: 2 to 90) days. The mean duration of symptoms of viral respiratory infection was 6.8+/-4.2 (range: 2 to 31) days.

Other TKIs, including imatinib and nilotinib, were also developed for treatment of CML, and recent studies were increasing about the therapeutic effects of other TKIs on solid tumors. However, the effect of radotinib on solid tumors has not yet been investigated. In this study, radotinib killed CML cell line K562 directly; however, radotinib did not enhance NK cell cytotoxicity against K562 cells. Because K562 is known as a Fas-negative cell line, we investigated whether radotinib could regulate cell cytotoxicity against various Fas-expressing solid cancer cell lines. Radotinib dramatically increased NK cell cytotoxicity against various Fas-expressing solid cancer cells, including lung, breast, and melanoma cells. Additionally, the efficiency of radotinib-enhanced cytotoxicity was lower in Fas siRNA-transfected cells than in negative controls, suggesting that Fas signaling might be involved in the radotinib-enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity. This study provides the first evidence that radotinib could be used as an effective and strong therapeutic to treat solid tumors via upregulation of NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that radotinib has indirect killing mechanisms via upregulation of antitumor innate immune responses as well as direct killing activities for CML cells.","['Kim, Kyung Eun', 'Park, Sunyoung', 'Cheon, Soyoung', 'Kim, Dong Yeon', 'Cho, Dae Jin', 'Park, Jeong Min', 'Hur, Dae Young', 'Park, Hyun Jeong', 'Cho, Daeho']","['Kim KE', 'Park S', 'Cheon S', 'Kim DY', 'Cho DJ', 'Park JM', 'Hur DY', 'Park HJ', 'Cho D']","[""Department of Cosmetic Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Chungpa-Dong 2-Ka, Yongsan-ku, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", 'Institute of Convergence Science, Korea University, Anam-ro 145, Seongbuk-ku, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', ""Nano-Bio Resources Center, Sookmyung Women's University, Chungpa-Dong 2-Ka, Yongsan-ku, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Cent'l Res.

HBV reactivation generally occurs in overt or occult HBV infection patients who suffered DDAs, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive therapy, especially when some solid tumors and leukemia patients are using hormones such as prednisolone and imatinib. The approximate incidence of HBV reactivation ranged from about 10% to 40%. Scientists often explore the molecular mechanisms from both the virus and the host. But some studies have reported that some drugs (cisplatin, rituximab, imatinib, and glucocorticoid) could induce HBV reactivation directly. However, the specific molecular mechanisms were unclear. With the emergence of new antiviral drugs and molecular targeted drugs, the risk of HBV reactivation will increase significantly.

More recently, ASNase has also been shown to have potential for preventing metastasis from solid tumors. The ASNase treatment is, however, characterized by a plethora of potential side effects, ranging from immune reactions to severe toxicity. Consequently, in accordance with Quality-by-Design (QbD) principles, ingenious new products tailored to minimize adverse reactions while increasing patient survival have been devised. In the following pages, the reader is invited for a brief discussion on the most recent developments in this field. Firstly, the review presents an outline of the recent improvements on the manufacturing and formulation processes, which can severely influence important aspects of the product quality profile, such as contamination, aggregation and enzymatic activity. Following, the most recent advances in protein engineering applied to the development of biobetter ASNases (i.e., with reduced glutaminase activity, proteolysis resistant and less immunogenic) using techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics, PEGylation, PASylation and bioconjugation are discussed. Afterwards, the attention is shifted toward nanomedicine including technologies such as encapsulation and immobilization, which aim at improving ASNase pharmacokinetics. Besides discussing the results of the most innovative and representative academic research, the review provides an overview of the products already available on the market or in the latest stages of development. With this, the review is intended to provide a solid background for the current product development and underpin the discussions on the target quality profile of future ASNase-based pharmaceuticals.","['Brumano, Larissa Pereira', 'da Silva, Francisco Vitor Santos', 'Costa-Silva, Tales Alexandre', 'Apolinario, Alexsandra Conceicao', 'Santos, Joao Henrique Picado Madalena', 'Kleingesinds, Eduardo Krebs', 'Monteiro, Gisele', 'Rangel-Yagui, Carlota de Oliveira', 'Benyahia, Brahim', 'Junior, Adalberto Pessoa']","['Brumano LP', 'da Silva FVS', 'Costa-Silva TA', 'Apolinario AC', 'Santos JHPM', 'Kleingesinds EK', 'Monteiro G', 'Rangel-Yagui CO', 'Benyahia B', 'Junior AP']","['Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, CICECO, Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190110,Switzerland,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,101632513,PMC6335324,,2019/01/29 06:00,2019/01/29 06:01,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2018/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fbioe.2018.00212 [doi]'],epublish,Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2019 Jan 10;6:212. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2018.00212. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['L-asparaginase', 'PEGylation', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'biobetters', 'nanobiotechnology', 'protein engineering', 'quality-by-design', 'site-directed mutagenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to direct BCR-ABL1 inhibitors is a common clinical issue, so STAT5 inhibition has become an interesting alternative target. In this study, the effects of NPQ-C6, a novel naphtoquinone-coumarin conjugate, were evaluated on human CML-derived K562 cells. Live-Cell Imaging analysis revealed that NPQ-C6 inhibited 2D (IC50AUC = 1.4 +/- 0.6 muM) growth of CML cells. NPQ-C6 increased sub-G1 and reduced G0/G1 cell cycle phases in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect on cell cycle was related to increased levels of apoptotic nuclei, cleavage of caspase-3, -9, and PARP and annexin V-positive cells. NPQ-C6 increased gammaH2AX, a double-strand DNA break marker. NPQ-C6 showed a wide range of modulatory effects on cell signaling through an early increased phosphorylation of JNK, P38-MAPK and AKT, and decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, BCR-ABL1, and STAT5. NPQ-C6 inhibited expression of c-MYC and PYM-1, two target gene products of BCR-ABL1/STAT5 signaling pathway. Cytokine-induced activation of STAT5/STAT3-dependent transcriptional and DNA binding activities were also inhibited by NPQ-C6. Notably, NPQ-C6 maintained its activity on BCR-ABL1/STAT5/c-MYC/PIM-1 oncogenic pathway in imatinib-resistant cells. Molecular modeling suggested BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 proteins as NPQ-C6 targets. In summary, our data show a novel multikinase modulator that might be therapeutically effective in BCR-ABL1-STAT5-related malignancies.","['Martin-Rodriguez, Patricia', 'Guerra, Borja', 'Hueso-Falcon, Idaira', 'Aranda-Tavio, Haidee', 'Diaz-Chico, Juan', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Estevez, Francisco', 'Diaz-Chico, Bonifacio', 'Amesty, Angel', 'Estevez-Braun, Ana', 'Fernandez-Perez, Leandro']","['Martin-Rodriguez P', 'Guerra B', 'Hueso-Falcon I', 'Aranda-Tavio H', 'Diaz-Chico J', 'Quintana J', 'Estevez F', 'Diaz-Chico B', 'Amesty A', 'Estevez-Braun A', 'Fernandez-Perez L']","['Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular y Traslacional, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular y Traslacional, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica, Instituto Universitario de Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez, Universidad de La Laguna, San Cristobal de La Laguna, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular y Traslacional, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular y Traslacional, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Bioquimica, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Bioquimica, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular y Traslacional, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica, Instituto Universitario de Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez, Universidad de La Laguna, San Cristobal de La Laguna, Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica, Instituto Universitario de Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez, Universidad de La Laguna, San Cristobal de La Laguna, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Farmacologia Molecular y Traslacional, Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190109,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC6334626,,2019/01/29 06:00,2019/01/29 06:01,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.01546 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Jan 9;9:1546. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.01546. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'coumarin', 'drug resistance', 'imatinib', 'leukemia', 'naphthoquinone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the difficulty in its diagnosis, the diagnostic criterion was just recently revised in 2016. CNL is defined as: A clonal disorder with sustained primary neutrophilia, with normal neutrophil maturation, that does not meet other MPN criteria, as well as no identifiable mutations of the PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK2 genes, and, either, the presence of a CSF3R mutation, or if absent, the presence of sustained neutrophilia (> 3 months), splenomegaly and no other identifiable cause of reactive neutrophilia including the absence of a plasma cell neoplasm, or, if present, demonstration of myeloid cell clonality by cytogenetics. Only about 200 cases have been reported. Case Presentation: We report a 61-year-old Caucasian male patient who initially presented with unexplained leukocytosis. An outpatient work-up was planned to rule out a myeloproliferative disorder but the patient was acutely admitted for MRSA septic shock. The patient was stabilized prior bone marrow work-up and was then diagnosed with an atypical type of CNL (JAK2 positive, CSF3R negative). The patient refused further treatment due to social circumstances and requested palliative care instead. Conclusion: This case aims to present atypical findings of an extremely rare MPN. Even though a recent revision has been made to help in its diagnosis, atypical findings must still be considered. This, in turn, will help to further improve the current CNL diagnostic criteria.","['Mendiola, Vincent Louie', 'Qian, You-Wen', 'Jana, Bagi']","['Mendiola VL', 'Qian YW', 'Jana B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20181220,Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,PMC6341362,,2019/01/29 06:00,2019/01/29 06:01,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2018/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000495458 [doi]', 'cro-0011-0871 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2018 Dec 20;11(3):871-879. doi: 10.1159/000495458. eCollection 2018 Sep-Dec.,['NOTNLM'],"['Atypical', 'Chronic neutrophilic leukemia', 'JAK2 positive']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reported outcomes have been poor, and the prognostic factors have not been clearly determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the prognostic significance of various cytogenetic abnormalities and minimal residual disease status determined by flow cytometry after induction I, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 80 patients with non-Down syndrome with a diagnosis of M7 AML treated at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357) from July 2007 through December 2016. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients, 15 died during induction I and were excluded from the survival analysis. The overall survival, event-free survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 52.6% +/- 12.7%, 45.2% +/- 12.3%, and 31.8% +/- 11.5% respectively. Of the 90 patients, 61 had cytogenetic abnormalities, including trisomy 19,13q, trisomy 8, complex karyotype, t(1;22), KMT2A rearrangements, and trisomy 21. None of these had an effect on the outcomes. In addition, 34 patients had minimal residual disease < 0.1% after induction I, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Patients with a delayed time to recovery (possibly due to myelofibrosis) had worse outcomes compared with those with early recovery (47% +/- 19.2% vs. 63.2% +/- 21.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in patients with non-Down syndrome has a poor outcome with no clearly defined prognostic factors. However, future directions to risk stratify and tailor therapy should include assessment of the tumor biology according to the molecular pathways and study of the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis in this disease, which could affect the prognosis.","['Maarouf, Noura', 'Mahmoud, Sonia', 'Khedr, Reham', 'Lehmann, Leslie', 'Shaaban, Khaled', 'Ibrahim, Sherine', 'Fahmy, Sonya', 'Hassanain, Omneya', 'Nader, Nouran', 'Elhaddad, Alaa']","['Maarouf N', 'Mahmoud S', 'Khedr R', 'Lehmann L', 'Shaaban K', 'Ibrahim S', 'Fahmy S', 'Hassanain O', 'Nader N', 'Elhaddad A']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE 57357), Cairo, Egypt.

Currently, the 5-year survival of AML patients is about 30% and for elderly patients, the rate drops to <10%. About 30% of AML patients harbor an activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of Fms-Like Tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) or a FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). Inhibitors of FLT3, such as Rydapt that was recently approved by the FDA, have shown good initial response but patients often relapse due to secondary mutations in the FLT3 TKD, like D835Y and F691L mutations. METHODS: Alkynyl aminoisoquinoline and naphthyridine compounds were synthesized via Sonogashira coupling. The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo effects on leukemia growth. FINDINGS: The compounds inhibited FLT3 kinase activity at low nanomolar concentrations. The lead compound, HSN431, also inhibited Src kinase activity. The compounds potently inhibited the viability of MV4-11 and MOLM-14 AML cells with IC50 values <1nM. Furthermore, the viability of drug-resistant AML cells harboring the D835Y and F691L mutations were potently inhibited. In vivo efficacy studies in mice demonstrated that the compounds could drastically reduce AML proliferation in mice. INTERPRETATION: Compounds that inhibit FLT3 and downstream targets like Src (for example HSN431) are good leads for development as anti-AML agents.

It is therefore necessary to understand and prevent the adverse effects of these drugs, in order to enable antileukemic therapy to continue and to minimize patients' toxic exposure. This multidisciplinary consensus document, developed through a collaboration between hematologists and cardiologists, aims to review the cardiovascular toxicity associated with various TKIs and to establish recommendations for the follow-up of these patients.

Manufacturing of these personalized treatments necessitates that a novel organization and supply chain be set in place, to ensure product preservation, patient safety and compliance with complex regulatory requirements. Side effects are commensurate with clinical efficacy and can be life-threatening: proper management imposes tight coordination between various specialists, particularly between hematologists and intensive care practitioners. High pricing for these treatments is part of a long-term trend for increasing costs of innovations in hematology and oncology; it questions the ability of healthcare systems to sustain their reimbursement.","['Chabannon, C', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Furst, S', 'Granata, A', 'Saillard, C', 'Vey, N', 'Mokart, D', 'Fougereau, E', 'Lemarie, C', 'Mfarrej, B', 'Blaise, D', 'Calmels, B']","['Chabannon C', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Furst S', 'Granata A', 'Saillard C', 'Vey N', 'Mokart D', 'Fougereau E', 'Lemarie C', 'Mfarrej B', 'Blaise D', 'Calmels B']","[""Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), 13009 Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille Universite, 13007 Marseille, France; Inserm, Aix-Marseille Universite, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 13009 Marseille, France; Inserm, Aix-Marseille Universite, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, AP-HM, CBT-1409, centre d'Investigations Cliniques en Biotherapies, 13009 Marseille, France.

Among the immunotherapy strategies that have recently been developed, CAR-T cells (chimeric antigen receptor modified T-cells) represent a major technological and therapeutic advance in the management of adult and pediatric patients with such resistant diseases. The first CAR-T trials targeting the ubiquitous B-cell antigen CD19 showed very encouraging results with complete remission rates of approximately 80%. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity are two major and potentially life-threatening adverse events, that require coordinated management with intensive care units and graduated use of IL-6 pathway blocking antibodies and steroids. In addition to immediate toxicity, many clinical issues arise such as ALL treatment from apheresis to CAR-T infusion, the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) before or after CAR-T therapy, or the reduction of escape mechanisms mostly driven by the loss of target expression. The development of these strategies in other subtypes of acute leukemias, including myeloid acute leukemia, is confronted with the expression of antigenic targets by healthy tissues and the potential risk of prolonged cytopenias. This review adopts a clinical perspective to detail the main results of CD19 CAR-T in ALL and the challenges raised by this new therapeutic approach.

Five-year overall survival is greater than 90% but leukemia remains a major cause of death from cancer in children. A new class of immunotherapy based on a chimeric antigen receptor ""CAR"" targeting the CD19 on the B leukemic cells and that is transduced in an autologous or allogenic T lymphocyte will allow to transform the prognosis of refractory or relapsed B-ALL. Overall response rates range from 60 to 90% in phase I-II studies in patients with second relapse or more or with refractory disease. Persistent remissions and even cures have been observed. These very good results could lead to use this treatment in first line for patients with very high-risk disease. However, CAR-T cells production, costs and adverse events management represent major issues for the future of this therapeutic. The occurrence of CD19 negative relapses has led to develop bispecific CAR-T cells. Allogeneic CAR would permit to obtain a ""CAR garage"" off the shelf available from the diagnosis. Perspectives for CAR-T cells are immense but will involve technological progresses around the CAR conception and production, leading to further improve results in leukemias (ALL but also AML) and lymphomas and hopefully to the emergence of efficacy in childhood solid tumors.

Knowledge of the CLL genetic heterogeneity led to the definition of molecular biomarkers informing about prognosis and treatment outcome. Areas covered: English literature published from January 2008 through December 2018 was searched in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and hematology meeting abstracts to obtain literature on clinical predictive factors for CLL. Peer-reviewed articles were selected based on the following concepts: CLL and genetic predictive factors (ATM, IGHV, NOTCH1, SF3B1, TP53). Additional references were selected by navigating relevant articles' reference lists. Of the 252 identified articles, 60 met the selection criteria. Expert opinion: Treatment options for CLL have increased significantly with the introduction of the BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, and novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. In this scenario, predictive biomarkers can assist physicians in optimizing treatment tailoring. Furthermore, treatment-emergent mutations leading to drug resistance are discovered in the majority of patients treated with BTK inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors, which could be switched to an alternative option.","['Condoluci, Adalgisa', 'Rossi, Davide']","['Condoluci A', 'Rossi D']","['a Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland and Laboratory of Experimental Hematology , Institute of Oncology Research , Bellinzona , Switzerland.', 'a Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland and Laboratory of Experimental Hematology , Institute of Oncology Research , Bellinzona , Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190206,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,,2019/01/29 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1575130 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Feb;12(2):89-98. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1575130.

Allison and Tasuku Honjo ""for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation"". A number of therapeutic approaches are available for cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation, and other strategies, some of which have been awarded previous Nobel Prizes. These include methods for hormone treatment for prostate cancer (Huggins, 1966), chemotherapy (Elion and Hitchins, 1988), and bone marrow transplantation for leukemia (Thomas, 1990). Many scientists engaged in intense basic research and uncovered fundamental mechanisms regulating immunity and also showed how the immune system can recognize cancer cells. T-cells were shown to have receptors that bind to structures recognized as non-self and such interactions trigger the immune system to engage in defense. However, additional proteins acting as T-cell accelerators are also required to trigger a full-blown immune response. Many scientists contributed to this important basic research and identified other proteins that function as brakes on the T-cells, inhibiting immune activation. This intricate balance between the accelerators and inhibitors is essential for a tight control. New strategy was developed into a therapy for humans. Promising results soon emerged from several groups, and in 2010 an important clinical study showed striking effects in patients with advanced melanoma. In several patients, signs of remaining cancer disappeared. The results were dramatic, leading to long-term remission and possible cure in several patients with metastatic cancer, a condition that had previously been considered essentially untreatable. Such remarkable results had never been seen in this patient group before (Fig. 2, Ref. 12).

Technical advances have led to the development of automated blood culture systems to detect bacterial infections. Usually positive signals in automated blood culture systems result from the proliferation of microorganisms. Cases are classified as false-positive when the automated blood culture system produces a positive signal but no microorganisms are detected on Gram-stained smears and no microorganism growth is observed in blood subcultures. False-positive blood culture results are very rare in patients with hematologic malignancies. Recently, we encountered four patients who had false-positive blood culture results. Two of the patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia, involving hyperleukocytosis and an excess of blasts. The other two patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma with leukocytopenia. Although hypercapnia or acidosis, apart from hyperleukocytosis, might also cause false-positive results, our cases clearly did not have these conditions. We should be aware of the possibility that false-positive blood culture results can occur in patients with leukocytopenia, as well as hyperleukocytosis. To understand the mechanisms responsible for the observed false-positive results, additional studies are needed after the accumulation of similar cases.","['Ebihara, Yasuhiro', 'Kobayashi, Kiyoko', 'Watanabe, Noriyuki', 'Taji, Yoshitada', 'Maeda, Tomoya', 'Takahashi, Naoki', 'Ishida, Akaru', 'Asou, Norio', 'Ikebuchi, Kenji']","['Ebihara Y', 'Kobayashi K', 'Watanabe N', 'Taji Y', 'Maeda T', 'Takahashi N', 'Ishida A', 'Asou N', 'Ikebuchi K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Saitama Medical University International Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.

However, data is quite limited regarding its action and mechanism, especially in hematologic cancer types. Here, antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of whole extract of the rhizome of Zingiber officinalis (ZOWE), was investigated in K562 cell line derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient. Various concentrations of whole extract (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100muM) were tested in K562 cultures. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis was assessed with appropriate methods, as well as cellular ROS levels. In this study, we showed that ZOWE inhibited proliferation of K562 cells substantially, when compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donor. Increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased PARP cleavage demonstrated that ZOWE inhibited proliferation by induction of apoptosis. These changes were coupled with an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, ZOWE addition to the culture also reduced expression levels of survival proteins pAkt and survivin, in a concentration dependent manner. Our results clearly mark that ZOWE causes to a reduction in cell viability, an induction of apoptosis and elevation in ROS levels in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and effects are significantly different from healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells, further supporting its potential therapeutic value.","['Mega Tiber, Pinar', 'Kocyigit Sevinc, Sevgi', 'Kilinc, Olca', 'Orun, Oya']","['Mega Tiber P', 'Kocyigit Sevinc S', 'Kilinc O', 'Orun O']","['Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.

Several Abl1 inhibitors are used as anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, drug resistance limits their effectiveness. The main cause for drug resistance is mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of Abl1 that evolve in patients. The T315I mutation confers resistance against all clinically-available inhibitors except ponatinib. Resistance to ponatinib can develop by compound (double) mutations. METHODS: Kinetic measurements of the KD of Abl1 and its mutants were carried out to examine their catalytic activity. Specifically, mutants that lead to drug resistance against ponatinib were considered. Molecular dynamics simulations and multiple sequence analysis were used for explanation of the experimental findings. RESULTS: The catalytic efficiency of the T315I pan-resistance mutant is more than two times lower than that of the native KD. All ponatinib resistant mutations restore the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Two of them (G250E/T315I and Y253H/E255V) have a catalytic efficiency that is more than five times that of the native KD. CONCLUSIONS: The measurements and analysis suggest that resistance is at least partially due to the development of a highly efficient kinase through subsequent mutations. The simulations highlight modifications in two structurally important regions of Abl1, the activation and phosphate binding loops, upon mutations. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Experimental and computational methods were used together to explain how mutations in the kinase domain of Abl1 lead to resistance against the most advanced drug currently in use to treat chronic myeloid leukaemia.","['Georgoulia, Panagiota S', 'Todde, Guido', 'Bjelic, Sinisa', 'Friedman, Ran']","['Georgoulia PS', 'Todde G', 'Bjelic S', 'Friedman R']","['Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Linnaeus University, 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden; Linnaeus University Centre of Excellence ""Biomaterials Chemistry"", 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Linnaeus University, 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden; Linnaeus University Centre of Excellence ""Biomaterials Chemistry"", 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Linnaeus University, 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden.

It consists of raising the patient's body temperature for therapeutic purposes. The article presents the results of in vitro studies describing the effect of an elevated temperature of 39.5 degrees C, the busulfan cytostatic and their combination on the level of apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 cells. OBJECTIVES: During the experiments, the influence of a 2.5 degrees C temperature increase on the behavior of the population of 2 groups of HL-60 cells, with busulfan cytostatic and without the cytostatic, was investigated. The control group consisted of 2 groups of HL-60 cells incubated at 37.0 degrees C with the cytostatic and without the cytostatic. Two questions were asked: 1. Is low-temperature hyperthermia likely to have an effect on the effectiveness of busulfan cytostatic? 2. Does the increase in temperature by 2.5 degrees C have an effect on the level of apoptosis in the unsaturated HL-60 cell line? MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 was used in the experiments to examine the influence of temperature on apoptosis HL-60 in 2 separated incubators set to 37.0 degrees C and 39.5 degrees C for 3 h. Apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometry using Annexin V. RESULTS: An increase in mortality of HL-60 cells was found in the case of simultaneous exposure to elevated temperature and busulfan in comparison to the group of cells treated with the cytostatic alone. There was no observed effect of an elevated temperature of 39.5 degrees C alone on the level of HL-60 cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the study results indicates that low-temperature hyperthermia may be used to increase the effectiveness of busulfan treatment. No effect of an elevated temperature of 39.5 degrees C on the level of apoptosis in HL-60 cells that were not treated with busulfan was observed. There is a need to test the efficacy of other cytostatic agents at elevated temperatures.","['Sztafrowski, Dariusz', 'Jazwiec, Bozena', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']","['Sztafrowski D', 'Jazwiec B', 'Kuliczkowski K']","['Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantations, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantations, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2019/01/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/91821 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2019 May;28(5):581-585. doi: 10.17219/acem/91821.,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60 cell line', 'apoptosis', 'busulfan', 'hyperthermia', 'in vitro']",,,,,,20190809,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Busulfan/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', '*Temperature']",['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we retrospectively compared the D-index, which reflects both the depth and duration of neutropenia, between two different chemotherapy regimens for AML. Sixty-seven patients with AML were included: 37 received an induction regimen of daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine followed by consolidation therapies consisting of standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) and other antineoplastic agents; the remaining 30 received idarubicin (IDR) and cytarabine as remission induction therapy followed by high-dose cytarabine (HDAC). The duration of neutropenia was shorter, but the D-index was higher, with IDR than with DNR. The total D-index during the entire consolidation therapies was significantly higher with SDAC than with HDAC. In conclusion, the neutropenia profile differs between treatment regimens, and thus, physicians should plan the management of infectious complications according to the neutropenia profile for each regimen.","['Kawasaki, Yasufumi', 'Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Nakano, Hirofumi', 'Mashima, Kiyomi', 'Shirato, Yuya', 'Kawaguchi, Shin-Ichiro', 'Toda, Yumiko', 'Ochi, Shin-Ichi', 'Nagayama, Takashi', 'Minakata, Daisuke', 'Yamasaki, Ryoko', 'Morita, Kaoru', 'Ashizawa, Masahiro', 'Yamamoto, Chihiro', 'Hatano, Kaoru', 'Sato, Kazuya', 'Oh, Iekuni', 'Fujiwara, Shin-Ichiro', 'Ohmine, Ken', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Muroi, Kazuo', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Kawasaki Y', 'Kimura SI', 'Nakano H', 'Mashima K', 'Shirato Y', 'Kawaguchi SI', 'Toda Y', 'Ochi SI', 'Nagayama T', 'Minakata D', 'Yamasaki R', 'Morita K', 'Ashizawa M', 'Yamamoto C', 'Hatano K', 'Sato K', 'Oh I', 'Fujiwara SI', 'Ohmine K', 'Kako S', 'Muroi K', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan. ycanda-tky@umin.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan. ycanda-tky@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190125,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2019/01/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02593-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02593-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Apr;109(4):470-476. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02593-2.

Methotrexate (MTX) is the cornerstone of chemotherapy for ALL, and works by targeting enzymes involved in the folate pathway. We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms of the folate pathway are associated with MTX toxicity in children with ALL. METHODS: A total of 64 children with ALL were included in this study; 31 (48.4%) boys and 33 (51.6%) girls aged 2-16 years. The folate pathway genes were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing and studying the association between genetic polymorphisms and MTX toxicity. RESULTS: The immunophenotype was B-lineage in 55 patients (85.9%) and T-lineage in nine patients (14.1%). All genetic polymorphisms, except for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase polymorphisms, were associated with hematological toxicities and did not appear to precipitate any non-hematological adverse events. Patients with ALL carrying dominant alleles of methylene tetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) C677T and dihydrofolate reductase 19 bp deletion were at a higher risk of developing severe leucopenia [OR (95% CI) = 4.5 (1.2-17), p = 0.03; 5.4 (1.6-17.8); p = 0.006] while minor allele carriers of MTHFR A1298C were more likely to develop neutropenia [OR (95% CI) = 6.1 (1.3-29.5); 0.04]. Furthermore, dominant allele carriers of thymidylate synthase 1494 del6 were at a higher risk of developing neutropenia [OR (95% CI) = 6 (1.2-31.1); p = 0.04]. CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms of the folate pathway may modulate MTX-induced toxicity in childhood ALL.","['Yousef, Al-Motassem', 'Farhad, Rand', 'Alshamaseen, Daniah', 'Alsheikh, Abrar', 'Zawiah, Mohammed', 'Kadi, Taha']","['Yousef AM', 'Farhad R', 'Alshamaseen D', 'Alsheikh A', 'Zawiah M', 'Kadi T']","['Department of Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Queen Rania Street, Amman, 11942, Jordan. ayousef@ju.edu.jo.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Queen Rania Street, Amman, 11942, Jordan.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Queen Rania Street, Amman, 11942, Jordan.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Queen Rania Street, Amman, 11942, Jordan.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Queen Rania Street, Amman, 11942, Jordan.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Queen Rania Street, Amman, 11942, Jordan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190125,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/01/21 06:00,['2019/01/27 06:00'],"['2018/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-019-03776-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-019-03776-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2019 Apr;83(4):755-762. doi: 10.1007/s00280-019-03776-8.

Here, we thoroughly interrogated PD-L1/PD-L2-involving somatic aberrations in 384 samples from various lymphoma subtypes using high-throughput sequencing, particularly focusing on virus-associated lymphomas. A high frequency of PD-L1/PD-L2-involving genetic aberrations was observed in EBV-positive lymphomas [33 (22%) of 148 cases], including extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL, 23%), aggressive NK-cell leukemia (57%), systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (17%) as well as EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 19%) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (15%). Predominantly causing a truncation of the 3'-untranslated region, these alterations represented the most prevalent somatic lesions in ENKTL. By contrast, the frequency was much lower in EBV-negative lymphomas regardless of histology type [12 (5%) of 236 cases]. Besides PD-L1/PD-L2 alterations, EBV-positive DLBCL exhibited a genetic profile distinct from EBV-negative one, characterized by frequent TET2 and DNMT3A mutations and the paucity of CD79B, MYD88, CDKN2A, and FAS alterations. Our findings illustrate unique genetic features of EBV-associated lymphomas, also suggesting a potential role of detecting PD-L1/PD-L2-involving lesions for these lymphomas to be effectively targeted by immune checkpoint blockade.","['Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Sakata, Seiji', 'Dobashi, Akito', 'Couronne, Lucile', 'Kogure, Yasunori', 'Sato, Yasuharu', 'Nishida, Kenji', 'Gion, Yuka',

The post-genomic era has been a productive period of discovery where modern sequencing methods have been applied to large MM patient cohorts to modernize our current perception of myeloma pathobiology and establish an appreciation for the vast heterogeneity that exists between and within MM patients. Numerous pre-clinical studies conducted in the last two decades have unveiled a compendium of mechanisms by which malignant plasma cells can escape standard therapies, many of which have potentially quantifiable biomarkers. Exhaustive pre-clinical efforts have evaluated countless putative anti-MM therapeutic agents and many of these have begun to enter clinical trial evaluation. While the palette of available anti-MM therapies is continuing to expand it is also clear that malignant plasma cells still have mechanistic avenues by which they can evade even the most promising new therapies. It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that there is an outstanding need to develop and employ precision medicine strategies in MM management that harness emerging tumor profiling technologies to identify biomarkers that predict efficacy or resistance within an individual's sub-clonally heterogeneous tumor. In this review we present an updated overview of broad classes of therapeutic resistance mechanisms and describe selected examples of putative biomarkers. We also outline several emerging tumor profiling technologies that have the potential to accurately quantify biomarkers for therapeutic sensitivity and resistance at genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Finally, we comment on the future of implementation for precision medicine strategies in MM and the clear need for a paradigm shift in clinical trial design and disease management.","['Harding, Taylor', 'Baughn, Linda', 'Kumar, Shaji', 'Van Ness, Brian']","['Harding T', 'Baughn L', 'Kumar S', 'Van Ness B']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology & Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology & Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. vanne001@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2019/01/27 06:00'],"['2018/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0362-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0362-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Apr;33(4):863-883. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0362-z.

Logistic regression analysis identified IDH1, ASXL1 and SRSF2 mutations, very high-risk karyotype, age > 70 years, male sex, circulating blasts >/= 3%, presence of moderate or severe anemia and constitutional symptoms, as predictors of LT in the first 5 years of diagnosis.

Increasing evidences have shown that the overexpression of COX-2 and increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) correlate with poor prognosis in human solid tumours and hematological malignancies. Both, in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that increased proliferation of cancer cells as well as an impairment of anti-tumour immunity are influenced by the overexpression of this enzyme. In leukemia and lymphoma, an increased activity of COX-2 and subsequent increase in prostaglandins (PGs) concentration allow cancer cells to evade immune response and contribute to metastases. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumour microenvironment, suppression of innate and adaptive immunity depends on COX-2/PGE22 axis activity which increases in hematological malignancies. Cyclooxygenases inhibitors block the formation of PGs, consequently inhibiting angiogenesis, and in some malignancies they decrease cancer cells proliferation and tumour invasiveness. They also increase apoptosis of CSCs and cancer cells, decrease their drug resistance as well as enhance the host immune response. Therefore COX-2/PGE2 axis suppressors: selective COX-2 inhibitors or PG receptors antagonists have been considered as promising anticancer drugs. In comparative oncology dogs are increasingly used as a large animal model because they share the same environmental conditions with people and are exposed to the same environmental factors and also due to their relatively short life span. In dogs, spontaneously occurring non-Hodgkin lymphomas and leukemias have a large number of genetic and morphological features that are similar to those of humans' corresponding cancers. This, additionally makes the species a useful model for the study of new therapeutic strategies in human oncology. While the influence of COX-2 activity and PGE2 receptors have been evaluated extensively in human cancer, their role in veterinary oncology still needs to be elucidated.","['Zmigrodzka, M', 'Rzepecka, A', 'Krzyzowska, M', 'Witkowska-Pilaszewicz, O', 'Cywinska, A', 'Winnicka, A']","['Zmigrodzka M', 'Rzepecka A', 'Krzyzowska M', 'Witkowska-Pilaszewicz O', 'Cywinska A', 'Winnicka A']","['Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, Poland. mzmigro@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.', 'The Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Diseases and Veterinary Diagnostics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190121,Poland,J Physiol Pharmacol,Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,9114501,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/02/20 06:00,['2019/01/27 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26402/jpp.2018.5.01 [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol Pharmacol. 2018 Oct;69(5). doi: 10.26402/jpp.2018.5.01.

By transplantation of lentiviral-transduced hematopoietic cells in the Mpl-deficient mouse model, we addressed whether known or predicted Thpo target genes were able to rescue the Mpl-deficient phenotype of the mice. Among the tested genes, we identified endothelial protein C receptor (Epcr) to expand HSCs with the long-term (LT)-HSC surface phenotype in Mpl(-/-) mice and to enable secondary transplantation of Mpl-deficient bone marrow (BM). Epcr-transduced Mpl(-/-) HSCs enter quiescence earlier after transplantation than control-transduced Mpl(-/-) cells, and upregulated expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL. Also, in the wild-type background, Epcr expression marked the engrafting population in the BM. Furthermore, Epcr expression in Mpl(-/-) hematopoiesis increased the number of megakaryocytes in the BM. In vitro Thpo supported the surface expression of Epcr on primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. With these data, we add new insights into Thpo-dependent influence on HSC engraftment after transplantation. This may be of use for the in vitro manipulation of HSCs, also in the context of gene therapy.","['Kohlscheen, Saskia', 'Schenk, Franziska', 'Rommel, Marcel G E', 'Cullmann, Katharina', 'Modlich, Ute']","['Kohlscheen S', 'Schenk F', 'Rommel MGE', 'Cullmann K', 'Modlich U']","['Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190125,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/01/27 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42669-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-03-837344 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Mar 28;133(13):1465-1478. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-03-837344.

It has been proposed that CMV-reactivation induces expression of HLA-DP molecules on GVHD target tissues by releasing inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that the increased GVHD incidence in HLA-DP mismatched allo-SCTs correlates with recipient CMV serostatus or CMV reactivation. In addition, CMV reactivation is associated with increased risk of GVHD with an unknown mechanism. Here, we analyzed the association between HLA-DPB1 and CMV reactivation on cumulative incidence of aGVHD and relapse as well as OS in 613 patients with AML and MDS who underwent matched related or unrelated allo-HCT at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2005 to 2011. In multivariable analysis, HLA-DPB1 mismatching was associated with increased risk of aGVHD (hazard ratio (HR): 1.53, P < 0.001) independent of CMV serostatus and CMV reactivation. Additionally, HLA-DPB1 mismatching was associated with decreased risk of relapse and no effect on OS. CMV reactivation increased risks of aGVHD (HR: 5.82, P < 0.001) independent of HLA-DP mismatching with no effect on relapse or OS. In conclusion, our data suggests that HLA-DPB1 mismatching and CMV reactivation increase risk of aGVHD independently.","['Ghobadi, Armin', 'Milton, Denai R', 'Gowda, Lohith', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Chemaly, Roy F', 'Hamdi, Amir', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Afrough, Aimaz', 'Oran, Betul', 'Ciurea, Stefan', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar H', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Bashir, Qaiser']","['Ghobadi A', 'Milton DR', 'Gowda L', 'Rondon G', 'Chemaly RF', 'Hamdi A', 'Alousi A', 'Afrough A', 'Oran B', 'Ciurea S', 'Kebriaei P', 'Popat UR', 'Qazilbash MH', 'Shpall EJ', 'Champlin RE', 'Bashir Q']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.

Glycan-based interactions play a vital role in immune surveillance, cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix interaction, contributing to treatment failure in tumor. However, the glycan essential for leukemia development and its upstream regulatory mechanism by oncogenic drivers were rarely reported. Here, we demonstrated that Le(X), a well-characterized cancer-related glycan epitope, strengthened the cell-matrix interaction via glycosylating alpha5beta1 integrin under the control of the driver oncogenic Ikaros isoform (IK6) in ALL. By analyzing the expression profile of Ikaros and the level of FUT4/Le(X) in clinical samples, we found that FUT4/Le(X) was positively correlated with dysfunctional Ikaros isoforms. IK1 (Full length Ikaros) regulates the level of FUT4 as a transcription repressor, while IK6 abolished the wild-type Ikaros mediated transcriptional repression and resulted in higher level of FUT4 expression. Moreover, we demonstrated that FUT4 could activate alpha5beta1-mediated sequential signal transduction and accelerate adhesion and invasion between integrin alpha5beta1 in leukemia cells and fibronectin in extracellular matrix (ECM) via increasing glycosylation. Together, our study provides a new insight into the mechanisms by which Ikaros mutation induced ALL cells invasion and a potential strategy for drug-resistance ALL by blocking Le(X) in combination with common chemotherapy.","['Yi, Lijun', 'Hu, Qinghua', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Liu, Zhiqiang', 'Li, Hong']","['Yi L', 'Hu Q', 'Zhou J', 'Liu Z', 'Li H']","[""Central Laboratory, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, Yangming Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330006, China."", ""Central Laboratory, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, Yangming Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330006, China."", ""Central Laboratory, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, Yangming Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330006, China."", ""Central Laboratory, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, Yangming Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330006, China."", ""Central Laboratory, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, Yangming Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330006, China.

Blood and lesion cultures revealed P.aeruginosa, confirming our clinical diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum. Subsequently an underlying immune deficit was found, namely patient was diagnosed with hairy-cell leukemia. Despite adequate antibiotics no infection control could be achieved. After treating the underlying immune deficit as well, the infection and hairy-cell leukemia resolved completely. CONCLUSION: Ecthyma gangrenosum is an important cutaneous infection to recognize, because it is it is typically associated with P.aeruginosa bacteremia. Recognizing this skin leasion should prompt empiric antimicrobial therapy including an agent with antipseudomonal activity.

The aim of the current study is to investigate the ability of INH to induce monocyte differentiation and the underlying signaling pathway involved in this phenomenon using HL-60cells. In this study, HL-60cells were treated with different non-cytotoxic concentrations of INH or vitamin D (a well-known inducer of monocytic differentiation) to determine key functional changes in the phenotype of these cells using several biochemical and cytobiological experiments. HL-60cells are derived from human promyelocytic leukemia and bear some resemblance to promyelocytes, which differentiate into various cell types. INH-induced differentiation was confirmed to occur in a concentration-dependent manner through several functional markers such as nonspecific esterase activity, NADPH oxidase activity and expression of surface markers CD14 and CD16 (characteristic of monocytes). INH-induced monocytic-like differentiation in HL-60cells and demonstrated that at least 25% of cells were differentiated within the range of the pharmacological concentrations of INH. To determine the effects of INH on HL-60cells, we applied quantitative proteomics that revealed 32 proteins were altered significantly in pathways that could involve differentiation signals. Lastly, INH activated the ERK-1/MAPK signaling pathway based on detection of phosphorylated ERK-1. These in vitro findings in HL-60cells warrant further study using promyelocytes or hematopoietic stem cells to evaluate the physiological capability of INH to induce monocytic differentiation that may aid in host defense against TB.","['Babu, Dinesh', 'Khan, Saifur R', 'Srivastava, Nutan', 'Kyoung Suh, Lindsey Yeon', 'Morgan, Andrew G', 'Aljuhani, Naif', 'Fahlman, Richard P', 'Siraki, Arno G']","['Babu D', 'Khan SR', 'Srivastava N', 'Kyoung Suh LY', 'Morgan AG', 'Aljuhani N', 'Fahlman RP', 'Siraki AG']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada; Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Taibah University, Madinah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada; Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

This study assessed the prevalence and associated factors of CMV infection in pediatric non-transplant leukemia patients.This was a cross-sectional study of 50 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients receiving chemotherapy at Ramathibodi Hospital from December 2015 to December 2016. CMV viral load quantified by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was monitored in different phases of chemotherapy: enrolment, post-induction, post-consolidation, post-intensification, and maintenance.One hundred forty one blood tests were evaluated from 50 patients. Overall prevalence of CMV DNAemia (>/=20 copies/mL) and high-level CMV DNAemia (>/=1000 copies/mL) was 52% (26 of 50) and 16.0% (8 of 50), respectively. All patients with high-level CMV DNAemia were in the maintenance phase of chemotherapy. One patient had CMV retinitis, while the rest had no end-organ CMV diseases. Increased lymphocyte count was significantly associated with protection from high-level CMV DNAemia (odds ratio 0.997, P = .02). Receiver operating characteristic curve identified a cut-off value of 798 cells/mm of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) as a discriminator for the presence of high-level CMV DNAemia (area under the curve 0.756, 95% CI 0.645-0.867, P = .001) with 88.9% sensitivity and 50.4% specificity.CMV infection predominantly occurred during maintenance chemotherapy. Low ALC was significantly associated with high-level CMV DNAemia. CMV infection surveillance by quantitative CMV DNA PCR during maintenance chemotherapy in patients with ALC <800 cells/mm may be considered.","['Phasuk, Nonthapan', 'Keatkla, Jiraporn', 'Rattanasiri, Sasivimol', 'Techasaensiri, Chonnamet', 'Anurathapan, Usanarat', 'Apiwattanakul, Nopporn']","['Phasuk N', 'Keatkla J', 'Rattanasiri S', 'Techasaensiri C', 'Anurathapan U', 'Apiwattanakul N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Road, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'School of Medicine, Walailuk University, 222 Thasala District, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Road, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Section for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Road, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Road, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Road, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Road, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC6358396,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000014256 [doi]', '00005792-201901250-00070 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jan;98(4):e14256. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000014256.,,,,,,,,20190204,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/*epidemiology/virology', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*virology', 'Prevalence', 'Viral Load']","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tremendous effort has been devoted to developing clinically effective FLT3 inhibitors. First generation inhibitors consisted of multi-kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lestaurtinib, midostaurin), which blocked FLT3 as well as multiple other kinase receptors. The failure of these agents to induce durable responses led to the development of second generation FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (quizartinib, crenolinib, gilteritinib) exhibiting high potency and specificity for mutant FLT3 kinases and sustained in vivo FLT3 inhibition. These myriad FLT3 inhibitors possess diverse kinase inhibitory properties, toxicity profiles, and pharmacokinetics, which impact on their incorporation into therapeutic regimens. Areas covered: This article reviews the medical literature on current and future FLT3 inhibitors for AML therapy. We provide algorithms for which kinase inhibitor should be utilized for different FLT3 mutations (ITD+/-TKD) and clinical scenarios (de novo, relapsed/refractory, fit vs. unfit) and discuss novel FLT3 targeted therapeutic approaches. Expert commentary: Integration of clinically active FLT3 inhibitors into all stages of therapy for all individuals with FLT3 mutant AML promises to significantly improve outcomes for this poor prognosis disease.","['Elshoury, Amro', 'Przespolewski, Amanda', 'Baron, Jeffrey', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Elshoury A', 'Przespolewski A', 'Baron J', 'Wang ES']","['a Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'a Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Pharmacy , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'a Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190206,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2019.1573679 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2019 Mar;19(3):273-286. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2019.1573679.

In particular, antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunotherapy have significantly changed the treatment approach of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. These therapies, initially employed in patients with refractory/relapsed disease, are now integrated in the treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Together with the therapeutic success, we have also learnt that these innovative therapies can induce relevant, sometimes life-threatening or even fatal, side effects. Areas covered: In this review article, we analyzed the applicative therapeutic scenario and the peculiar toxicities associated with approaches of immunotherapy, paying particular attention to the new emerging side effects, substantially unknown before the introduction of these therapies. Expert commentary: Both monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy with lymphocytes genetically modified to be redirected against leukemia targets through the transduction with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have obtained unprecedented success in rescuing patients with resistant B-cell malignancies. Complications, such as neurotoxicity, cytokine release syndrome or persistent B-cell lymphopenia, must always be taken into consideration and diagnosed in a timely manner in patients with B-cell neoplasms to guarantee optimal management, thus avoiding they blunting the efficacy of immunotherapy.","['Del Bufalo, Francesca', 'Merli, Pietro', 'Alessi, Iside', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Del Bufalo F', 'Merli P', 'Alessi I', 'Locatelli F']","['a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cellular and Gene Therapy , IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cellular and Gene Therapy , IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cellular and Gene Therapy , IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cellular and Gene Therapy , IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'b Department of Pediatrics , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190206,England,Expert Rev Clin Immunol,Expert review of clinical immunology,101271248,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1744666X.2019.1573672 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Immunol. 2019 May;15(5):497-509. doi: 10.1080/1744666X.2019.1573672.

Some may have a delay in their treatment plan due to same-day cancelation (SDC) of the procedure due to issues related to sedation or other factors. The objective of this report was to evaluate the factors resulting in the SDC of hematology and oncology patients in an outpatient pediatric sedation service. METHODS: Retrospective review of children with cancer or other hematologic disorders undergoing outpatient procedures using a dedicated pediatric sedation team from January 2012 to December 2017. The children with SDC were compared to controls (ie, patients not canceled) during the above study period. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients had SDC during the study. The median age was 10 years (25th percentile to 75th percentile: 7-10 years). The overall SDC rate was 3% and 78/100 (78%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Most common procedure was lumbar puncture with intrathecal chemotherapy in 82/100 (82%) patients. Inadequate blood counts, acute illness, and not nil per os (NPO) accounted for 83% of the reasons for SDC. Type of health insurance, estimated household income, or distance traveled to the clinic did not impact SDC.

In this strategy, a patient's own T cells are genetically engineered to express a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen. CAR T cells are then expanded for clinical use and infused back into the patient's body to attack and destroy chemotherapy-resistant cancer. Dramatic clinical responses and high rates of complete remission have been observed in the setting of CAR T-cell therapy of B-cell malignancies. This resulted in two recent FDA approvals of CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, CAR T cells are arguably one of the first successful examples of synthetic biology and personalized cellular cancer therapy to become commercially available. In this review, we introduce the concept of using CAR T cells to break immunological tolerance to tumors, highlight several challenges in the field, discuss the utility of biomarkers in the context of predicting clinical responses, and offer prospects for developing next-generation CAR T cell-based approaches that will improve outcome.","['Feins, Steven', 'Kong, Weimin', 'Williams, Erik F', 'Milone, Michael C', 'Fraietta, Joseph A']","['Feins S', 'Kong W', 'Williams EF', 'Milone MC', 'Fraietta JA']","['Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190218,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25418 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 May;94(S1):S3-S9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25418.

Unfortunately, the majority of patients treated will not achieve durable remissions. Reasons for these suboptimal clinical outcomes can be tied back to intrinsic CAR T cell design and manufacturing processes, factors that are highly amenable to modification and improvement. As CAR T cell therapy is being deployed in spaces outside of CD19-positive disease, these limitations, complications, and setbacks need to be overcome, allowing for the full potential of this novel therapy to be realized. Preclinical work has begun tackling these major roadblocks, paving the way for potentially off-the-shelf products that are safer and more potent.

It is usually distinguished between disease-related and disease-unrelated death. A frequently used approach is to define death as disease-related when a progression to advanced phases has occurred before, otherwise as disease-unrelated. The data are often analyzed as competing risks, while a progressive illness-death model might in fact describe the situation more precisely. In this study, we investigated under which circumstances this misspecification leads to biased estimations of the state occupation probabilities. We simulated data according to the progressive illness-death model in various settings, analyzed them with a competing risks model and with a progressive illness-death model and compared them to the true state occupation probabilities. Censoring was either added independently of the status or based on the patients' status. The simulations showed that the censoring mechanism was decisive for the bias while neither the progression hazard nor the Markov property was important. Further, we found a slightly increased standard deviation for the competing risk estimator when censoring was independent of the patients' status. For illustration, both methods were applied to two practical examples of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): one randomized controlled trial and one registry data set. While in the first case both estimators yielded almost identical results, in the latter case, visible differences were found between both methods.","['Lauseker, Michael', 'Zu Eulenburg, Christine']","['Lauseker M', 'Zu Eulenburg C']","['Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology, Munchen, Bavaria, Germany.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Medical Statistics and Decision Making, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190125,Germany,Biom J,Biometrical journal.

A retrospective study including 543 patients with ALL was performed. MRD was determined using multiparametric flow cytometry. Both in the entire cohort of patients and in subgroup cases with T-ALL or B-ALL, patients with positive pre-MRD had a higher incidence of relapse (CIR) than those with negative pre-MRD in MSDT settings (P < 0.01 for all). Landmark analysis at 6 months showed that MRD positivity was significantly and independently associated with inferior rates of relapse (HR, 1.908; P = 0.007), leukemia-free survival (LFS) (HR, 1.559; P = 0.038), and OS (HR, 1.545; P = 0.049). The levels of pre-MRD according to a logarithmic scale were also associated with leukemia relapse, LFS, and OS, except that cases with MRD <0.01% experienced comparable CIR and LFS to those with negative pre-MRD. A risk score for CIR was developed using the variables pre-MRD, disease status, and immunophenotype of ALL. The CIR was 14%, 26%, and 59% for subjects with scores of 0, 1, and 2-3, respectively (P < 0.001). Three-year LFS was 75%, 64%, and 42%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of the risk score with CIR and LFS. The results indicate that positive pre-MRD, except for low level one (MRD < 0.01%), is associated with poor outcomes in patients with ALL who underwent unmanipulated haplo-SCT.","['Zhao, Xiao-Su',

In the present study, we sought to evaluate renal function and hemoglobin levels during long-term imatinib treatment. Eighty-two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase who had been on imatinib for over 5 years were retrospectively analyzed. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly decreased over 5 years (77 +/- 17 to 62 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73m(2), P < 0.001). Higher age and lower eGFR value at initiation of imatinib were significantly associated with development of renal dysfunction by multivariate analyses. Mean hemoglobin levels also significantly decreased over the 5-year period (12.9 +/- 1.7 to 12.4 +/- 1.3 g/dl, P < 0.01). The rate of decrease in eGFR correlated significantly with hemoglobin levels (correlation coefficient = - 0.249, P < 0.05). Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels did not increase in 16 patients with both renal dysfunction and anemia (median, 31.9 mIU/ml). In patients who participated in a clinical trial of imatinib discontinuation, mean eGFR (50.0 +/- 6.5 to 56.0 +/- 10.2 ml/min/1.73m(2), P < 0.05) and hemoglobin levels (12.0 +/- 1.7 to 14.0 +/- 1.6 g/dl, P < 0.01) improved significantly at 1 year after discontinuation. These findings suggest that long-term imatinib results in a partially reversible continuous decline in renal function and decreased hemoglobin levels.","['Sakurai, Masatoshi', 'Kikuchi, Taku', 'Karigane, Daiki', 'Kasahara, Hidenori', 'Matsuki, Eri', 'Hashida, Risa', 'Yamane, Yusuke', 'Abe, Ryohei', 'Koda, Yuya', 'Toyama, Takaaki', 'Kato, Jun', 'Shimizu, Takayuki', 'Yokoyama, Yuta', 'Suzuki, Sayo', 'Nakamura, Tomonori', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Mori, Takehiko']","['Sakurai M', 'Kikuchi T', 'Karigane D', 'Kasahara H', 'Matsuki E', 'Hashida R', 'Yamane Y', 'Abe R', 'Koda Y', 'Toyama T', 'Kato J', 'Shimizu T', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Suzuki S', 'Nakamura T', 'Okamoto S', 'Mori T']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmaceutical Care Sciences, Keio University Faculty of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmaceutical Care Sciences, Keio University Faculty of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmaceutical Care Sciences, Keio University Faculty of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan. tmori@a3.keio.jp.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190124,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02596-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02596-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Mar;109(3):292-298. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02596-z.

However, we previously showed that the long-term prognosis of patients with smoldering and chronic ATL is often worse than expected, with many undergoing transformation to aggressive ATL. To identify clinical features associated with transformation of smoldering/chronic ATL, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of 44 patients (14 smoldering and 30 chronic) who experienced transformation during WW. An elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value was most often observed (n = 30) at the time of transformation, especially in the chronic type (n = 24). Major organ involvement, lymphadenopathy, and hypercalcemia were shown to be associated with transformation in transformed patients without elevated LDH. The median overall survival time after transformation was only 7.8 months, and the prognosis was poor after transformation in those fulfilling the criteria of acute type, similar to that of de novo aggressive ATL. Laboratory data, such as LDH, and clinical signs including exacerbation of performance status, skin lesions, and lymphadenopathy should all be monitored during WW to ensure appropriate timing of chemotherapy initiation. Identification of optimal predictive markers for transformation and new therapeutic options is warranted to improve outcomes in indolent ATL.","['Taniguchi, Hiroaki', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Takasaki, Yumi', 'Nakashima, Jun', 'Kato, Takeharu', 'Itonaga, Hidehiro', 'Sato, Shinya', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Ando, Koji', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Taniguchi H', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Takasaki Y', 'Nakashima J', 'Kato T', 'Itonaga H', 'Sato S', 'Sawayama Y', 'Ando K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Hata T', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan. y-imaizm@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Saint Francis Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190124,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02602-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02602-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Apr;109(4):402-408. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02602-4.

Recently, a growing body of evidence supports a putative role of autophagy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia; however, no definitive clue has been established so far. To elucidate this issue, we have developed a pilot study to measure autophagic flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, and explored its correlation with classical clinical/analytical parameters. METHODS/PATIENTS: Thirty-three chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients participated in the study. Autophagic flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined by western blot measuring the levels of the proteins p62 and lipidated LC3. Moreover, p62 mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Lymphocytosis and the percentage of tumoral lymphocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients statistically correlate with a blocked autophagic flux. CONCLUSION: Alterations in autophagic flux could play an important role in the physiopathology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Romero-Macias, J-R', 'Pascual-Serra, R', 'Roche, O', 'Ruiz-Marcos, F', 'Serrano-Martinez, A', 'Gonzalez-Aguado, P', 'Belandia, B', 'Ruiz-Hidalgo, M-J', 'Sanchez-Prieto, R']","['Romero-Macias JR', 'Pascual-Serra R', 'Roche O', 'Ruiz-Marcos F', 'Serrano-Martinez A', 'Gonzalez-Aguado P', 'Belandia B', 'Ruiz-Hidalgo MJ', 'Sanchez-Prieto R']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Molecular, Unidad de Medicina Molecular, Centro Regional de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Molecular, Unidad de Medicina Molecular, Centro Regional de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Molecular, Unidad de Medicina Molecular, Centro Regional de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Unidad Asociada de Biomedicina CSIC-UCLM, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Medicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Lab. 1.5.2, Departamento de Biologia del Cancer, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"" (CSIC-UAM), Arturo Duperier, 4, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad Asociada de Biomedicina CSIC-UCLM, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Molecular, Unidad de Medicina Molecular, Centro Regional de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Unidad Asociada de Biomedicina CSIC-UCLM, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Area de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02006, Albacete, Spain.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Medicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02006, Albacete, Spain. rsprieto@iib.uam.es.', 'Lab. 1.5.2, Departamento de Biologia del Cancer, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"" (CSIC-UAM), Arturo Duperier, 4, 28029, Madrid, Spain. rsprieto@iib.uam.es.', 'Unidad Asociada de Biomedicina CSIC-UCLM, 28029, Madrid, Spain. rsprieto@iib.uam.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190124,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-019-02041-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-019-02041-x [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2019 Sep;21(9):1280-1285. doi: 10.1007/s12094-019-02041-x.

High-risk MDS patients who received non-T-cell-depleted allo-HSCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology and were MRD-positive after allo-HSCT were studied (n = 47). The MRD-positive status was considered if leukemia-associated aberrant immune phenotypes or Wilms' tumor gene 1 expression is present in a single bone marrow sample.

Here, we report that Smac mimetic-mediated activation of NF-kappaB contributes to the rescue of cancer cells from tunicamycin (TM)-triggered apoptosis. The prototypic Smac mimetic BV6 activates non-canonical and canonical NF-kappaB pathways, while TM has little effect on NF-kappaB signaling. Importantly, ectopic expression of dominant-negative IkappaBalpha superrepressor (IkappaBalpha-SR), which inhibits canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB activation, significantly reversed this BV6-imposed protection against TM. Similarly, transient or stable knockdown of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, which accumulated upon exposure to BV6 alone and in combination with TM, significantly counteracted BV6-mediated inhibition of TM-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, while cIAP2 was initially degraded upon BV6 treatment, it was subsequently upregulated in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner, as this restoration of cIAP2 expression was abolished in IkappaBalpha-SR-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, upon exposure to TM/BV6 apoptosis was significantly increased in cIAP2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, NF-kappaB inhibition partially prevented BV6-stimulated expression of Mcl-1 upon TM treatment. Consistently, Mcl-1 silencing significantly inhibited BV6-mediated protection from TM-induced apoptosis. Thus, NF-kappaB activation by Smac mimetic contributes to Smac mimetic-mediated protection against TM-induced apoptosis.","['Abhari, Behnaz Ahangarian', 'McCarthy, Nicole', 'Agostinis, Patrizia', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Abhari BA', 'McCarthy N', 'Agostinis P', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Cell Death Research and Therapy Unit, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, KU Leuven, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/04/04 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10495-018-1507-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-018-1507-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2019 Apr;24(3-4):269-277. doi: 10.1007/s10495-018-1507-2.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell death', '*NF-kappaB', '*Smac', '*Tunicamycin']","['IUAP/32/Interuniversity Attraction Poles Program, Belgian State, Science Policy', 'Office/International']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0459-6417'],,,20200403,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, there are few reports on cerebral vascular disease associated with nilotinib use. We herein describe the case of a 55-year-old male patient with CML, who presented with cerebral infarction and severe cerebrovascular stenosis that developed during nilotinib treatment. The patient was diagnosed with cerebral infarction and severe stenosis of the intracranial arteries associated with nilotinib use. Vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VW-MRI) revealed diffuse concentric thickening of the vessel wall, unlike ordinary patterns of atherosclerosis. The patient underwent direct revascularization (superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass) and was successfully treated without recurrence. Based on this rare case, VW-MRI may be used to detect the morphological changes of the intracranial arteries that are associated with nilotinib use. Moreover, surgical revascularization may improve the prognosis of nilotinib-associated cerebrovascular diseases, such as severe stenosis or occlusion of the main trunk of the cerebral arteries, that cause brain ischemia.","['Suzuki, Kohei', 'Yamamoto, Junkoh', 'Kakeda, Shingo', 'Takamatsu, Seishiro', 'Miyaoka, Ryo', 'Kitagawa, Takehiro', 'Saito, Takeshi', 'Nakano, Yoshiteru', 'Nishizawa, Shigeru']","['Suzuki K', 'Yamamoto J', 'Kakeda S', 'Takamatsu S', 'Miyaoka R', 'Kitagawa T', 'Saito T', 'Nakano Y', 'Nishizawa S']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 807-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181130,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,PMC6327219,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/01/27 06:01,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2018.1780 [doi]', 'MCO-0-0-1780 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2019 Feb;10(2):239-243. doi: 10.3892/mco.2018.1780.

Pre-cancerous lesions, or early stage cancers, often show signs of a telomere crisis, suggesting that escape from telomere crisis is a prerequisite for disease progression. Telomeric crisis therefore represents an attractive, and as yet unexplored, opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that two clinically approved PARP inhibitors, selectively eliminate human cells undergoing a telomere-driven crisis. Clonal populations of a colorectal cancer cell line (HCT116), or the plasma cell leukaemia cell line (JJN-3), expressing a dominant-negative telomerase, entered a telomere-driven crisis at defined population doubling points and telomere lengths. The addition of the PARP inhibitors, olaparib or rucaparib prevented these cells from escaping crisis. PARP inhibition did not alter cellular proliferation prior to crisis, rates of telomere erosion or the telomere length at which crisis was initiated, but affected repair of eroded telomeres, resulting in an increased in intra-chromosomal telomere fusion. This was accompanied by enhanced DNA damage checkpoint activation and elevated levels of apoptosis. We propose that PARP inhibitors impair the repair of dysfunctional telomeres and/or induce replicative stress at telomeres to inhibit escape from a telomere crisis. This is the first demonstration that a drug can selectively kill cells experiencing telomeric crisis. We propose that this type of drug, which we term 'crisolytic', has the potential to eliminate pre-cancerous lesions and tumours exhibiting short dysfunctional telomeres.","['Ngo, Greg', 'Hyatt, Sam', 'Grimstead, Julia', 'Jones, Rhiannon', 'Hendrickson, Eric', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Baird, Duncan']","['Ngo G', 'Hyatt S', 'Grimstead J', 'Jones R', 'Hendrickson E', 'Pepper C', 'Baird D']","['Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'University of Sussex, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181225,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6331021,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],2019/01/27 06:00,2019/01/27 06:01,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26499 [doi]', '26499 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Dec 25;9(101):37549-37563. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26499. eCollection 2018 Dec 25.,['NOTNLM'],"['PARP1', 'cancer', 'crisis', 'genome instability', 'telomere']",['R01 CA190492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IC and NIC as well as BSC treatment options are available; however, there is scant published literature on the impact of disease and treatment on the HRQoL in patients receiving NIC. Aim: This study determined the HRQoL among NIC AML patients. Materials and methods: Embase, Medline, Cochrane database, and conference abstracts were searched using the prespecified PICOS criteria from January 2000 to November 2017 for studies reporting HRQoL and patient preference utilities in NIC AML. Studies on patients with RAEB-t MDS, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective observational studies, and patient surveys were included, while systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used for bibliographic searching. Results: Thirteen records from 12 original studies were identified. These included five records from four RCTs, three prospective studies, four patient survey studies, and one cost-effectiveness analysis. At baseline, NIC AML patients had poor HRQoL scores especially in fatigue (33) and GHS (50) on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health. Low baseline HRQoL scores, especially PF and fatigue (<50) were shown to be significant independent predictors of poor survival. Clinical responders demonstrated meaningful improvements, especially in PF and fatigue, along with other health domains after being treated with NIC agents across several studies. Conclusion: HRQoL is poor for patients with NIC AML; measures such as fatigue and PF at baseline have been identified as independent prognostic factors for overall survival with several studies showing improvement in both domains with treatment.

Their immunomodulatory effects are controlled by microenvironmental signals. The MSCs' functional response towards inflammatory cues is known as MSC-""licensing"" and includes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) upregulation. MSCs use tryptophan-depleting IDO to suppress T-cells. Increasing evidence suggests that several functions are (co-)determined by the cells' metabolic commitment. MSCs are capable of both, high levels of glycolysis and of oxidative phosphorylation. Although several studies have addressed alterations of the immune regulatory phenotype elicited by inflammatory priming metabolic mechanisms controlling this process remain unknown. We demonstrate that inflammatory MSC-licensing causes metabolic shifts including enhanced glycolysis and increased fatty acid oxidation. Yet, only interfering with glycolysis impacts IDO upregulation and impedes T-cell-suppressivity. We identified the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 pathway as a regulator of both glycolysis and IDO, and show that enhanced glucose turnover is linked to abundant STAT1 glycosylation. Inhibiting the responsible O-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase abolishes STAT1 activity together with IDO upregulation. Our data suggest that STAT1-O-GlcNAcylation increases its stability towards degradation thus sustaining downstream effects. This pathway could represent a target for interventions aiming to enhance the MSCs' immunoregulatory potency.","['Jitschin, R', 'Bottcher, M', 'Saul, D', 'Lukassen, S', 'Bruns, H', 'Loschinski, R', 'Ekici, A B', 'Reis, A', 'Mackensen, A', 'Mougiakakos, D']","['Jitschin R', 'Bottcher M', 'Saul D', 'Lukassen S', 'Bruns H', 'Loschinski R', 'Ekici AB', 'Reis A', 'Mackensen A', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054, Erlangen, Germany. dimitrios.mougiakakos@uk-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190124,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0376-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0376-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jul;33(7):1783-1796. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0376-6.

We used two murine AML models based on retroviral overexpression of Hoxa9/Meis1 (H9M) or MN1 to study LSD1 loss of function in AML. The conditional knockout of Lsd1 resulted in differentiation with both granulocytic and monocytic features and increased ATRA sensitivity and extended the survival of mice with H9M-driven AML. The conditional knockout led to an increased expression of multiple genes regulated by the important myeloid transcription factors GFI1 and PU.1. These include the transcription factors GFI1B and IRF8. We also compared the effect of different irreversible and reversible inhibitors of LSD1 in AML and could show that only tranylcypromine derivatives were capable of inducing a differentiation response. We employed a conditional knock-in model of inactive, mutant LSD1 to study the effect of only interfering with LSD1 enzymatic activity. While this was sufficient to initiate differentiation, it did not result in a survival benefit in mice. Hence, we believe that targeting both enzymatic and scaffolding functions of LSD1 is required to efficiently treat AML. This finding as well as the identified biomarkers may be relevant for the treatment of AML patients with LSD1 inhibitors.","['Barth, Jessica', 'Abou-El-Ardat, Khalil', 'Dalic, Denis', 'Kurrle, Nina', 'Maier, Anna-Maria', 'Mohr, Sebastian', 'Schutte, Judith', 'Vassen, Lothar', 'Greve, Gabriele', 'Schulz-Fincke, Johannes', 'Schmitt, Martin', 'Tosic, Milica', 'Metzger, Eric', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Wagner, Sebastian A', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Jung, Manfred', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Schule, Roland', 'Berg, Tobias']","['Barth J', 'Abou-El-Ardat K', 'Dalic D', 'Kurrle N', 'Maier AM', 'Mohr S', 'Schutte J', 'Vassen L', 'Greve G', 'Schulz-Fincke J', 'Schmitt M', 'Tosic M', 'Metzger E', 'Bug G', 'Khandanpour C', 'Wagner SA', 'Lubbert M', 'Jung M', 'Serve H', 'Schule R', 'Berg T']","['Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Center for Clinical Research, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Center for Clinical Research, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Center for Clinical Research, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University, 79104, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. tobias.berg@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Frankfurt, Germany. tobias.berg@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. tobias.berg@kgu.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190124,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/09/07 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0375-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0375-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jun;33(6):1411-1426. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0375-7.

N-terminal CEBPA mutations cause ablation of full-length C/EBPalpha without affecting the expression of a shorter oncogenic isoform, termed p30. The mechanistic basis of p30-induced leukemogenesis is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the MLL1 histone-methyltransferase complex represents a critical actionable vulnerability in CEBPA-mutated AML. Oncogenic C/EBPalpha p30 and MLL1 show global co-localization on chromatin and p30 exhibits robust physical interaction with the MLL1 complex. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of MLL1 results in proliferation arrest and myeloid differentiation in C/EBPalpha p30-expressing cells. In line, CEBPA-mutated hematopoietic progenitor cells are hypersensitive to pharmacological targeting of the MLL1 complex. Inhibitor treatment impairs proliferation and restores myeloid differentiation potential in mouse and human AML cells with CEBPA mutations. Finally, we identify the transcription factor GATA2 as a direct critical target of the p30-MLL1 interaction. Altogether, we show that C/EBPalpha p30 requires the MLL1 complex to regulate oncogenic gene expression and that CEBPA-mutated AML is hypersensitive to perturbation of the MLL1 complex. These findings identify the MLL1 complex as a potential therapeutic target in AML with CEBPA mutations.","['Schmidt, Luisa', 'Heyes, Elizabeth', 'Scheiblecker, Lisa', 'Eder, Thomas', 'Volpe, Giacomo', 'Frampton, Jon', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Valent, Peter', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Grebien, Florian']","['Schmidt L', 'Heyes E', 'Scheiblecker L', 'Eder T', 'Volpe G', 'Frampton J', 'Nerlov C', 'Valent P', 'Grembecka J', 'Grebien F']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute for Medical Biochemistry, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, Birmingham, UK.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, Birmingham, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria. florian.grebien@vetmeduni.ac.at.', 'Institute for Medical Biochemistry, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. florian.grebien@vetmeduni.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190124,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6612510,,2019/01/27 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0382-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0382-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jul;33(7):1608-1619. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0382-3.

As mutations in STAT5B, but not STAT5A, have been frequently described in hematopoietic tumors, we used BCR/ABL as model systems to investigate the contribution of STAT5A or STAT5B for leukemogenesis. The absence of STAT5A decreased cell survival and colony formation. Even more drastic effects were observed in the absence of STAT5B. STAT5B-deficient cells formed BCR/ABL(+) colonies or stable cell lines at low frequency. The rarely evolving Stat5b(-/-) cell lines expressed enhanced levels of BCR/ABL oncoprotein compared to wild-type cells. In line, Stat5b(-/-) leukemic cells induced leukemia with a significantly prolonged disease onset, whereas Stat5a(-/-) cells rapidly caused a fatal disease superimposable to wild-type cells. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) profiling revealed a marked enhancement of interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma signatures in Stat5b(-/-) cells. Inhibition of IFN responses rescued BCR/ABL(+) colony formation of Stat5b(-/-)-deficient cells. A downregulated IFN response was also observed in patients suffering from leukemia carrying STAT5B mutations. Our data define STAT5B as major STAT5 isoform driving BCR/ABL(+) leukemia. STAT5B enables transformation by suppressing IFN-alpha/gamma, thereby facilitating leukemogenesis. Our findings might help explain the high frequency of STAT5B mutations in hematopoietic tumors.","['Kollmann, Sebastian', 'Grundschober, Eva', 'Maurer, Barbara', 'Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Grausenburger, Reinhard', 'Edlinger, Leo', 'Huuhtanen, Jani', 'Lagger, Sabine', 'Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Valent, Peter', 'Decker, Thomas', 'Strobl, Birgit', 'Mueller, Mathias', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic, Andrea', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Kollmann S', 'Grundschober E', 'Maurer B', 'Warsch W', 'Grausenburger R', 'Edlinger L', 'Huuhtanen J', 'Lagger S', 'Hennighausen L', 'Valent P', 'Decker T', 'Strobl B', 'Mueller M', 'Mustjoki S', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic A', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210, Vienna, Austria.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, P.O.Box 700, 00290, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Unit of Laboratory Animal Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Max F.

However, most GSK3 inhibitors lack specificity for GSK3alpha over GSK3beta and other kinases. We have previously shown in lung cancer cells that GSK3alpha and to a lesser extent GSK3beta are inhibited by the advanced clinical candidate tivantinib (ARQ197), which was designed as a MET inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesized that tivantinib would be an effective therapy for the treatment of AML. Here, we show that tivantinib has potent anticancer activity across several AML cell lines and primary patient cells. Tivantinib strongly induced apoptosis, differentiation and G2/M cell cycle arrest and caused less undesirable stabilization of beta-catenin compared to the pan-GSK3 inhibitor LiCl. Subsequent drug combination studies identified the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to synergize with tivantinib while cytarabine combination with tivantinib was antagonistic. Interestingly, the addition of ABT-199 to tivantinib completely abrogated tivantinib induced beta-catenin stabilization. Tivantinib alone, or in combination with ABT-199, downregulated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels, which likely contribute to the observed synergy. Importantly, tivantinib as single agent or in combination with ABT-199 significantly inhibited the colony forming capacity of primary patient AML bone marrow mononuclear cells. In summary, tivantinib is a novel GSK3alpha/beta inhibitor that potently kills AML cells and tivantinib single agent or combination therapy with ABT-199 may represent attractive new therapeutic opportunities for AML.","['Kuenzi, Brent M', 'Remsing Rix, Lily L', 'Kinose, Fumi', 'Kroeger, Jodi L', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Padron, Eric', 'Rix, Uwe']","['Kuenzi BM', 'Remsing Rix LL', 'Kinose F', 'Kroeger JL', 'Lancet JE', 'Padron E', 'Rix U']","['Department of Drug Discovery, H.

Reproducing a proliferative stimulation ex vivo is critical to decipher the mechanisms of leukemogenesis in these malignancies. However, functional studies of CLL cells remains limited since current ex vivo B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation protocols are not sufficient to induce the proliferation of these cells, pointing out the need of mandatory BCR co-factors in this process. Here, we investigated benefits of several BCR co-stimulatory molecules (IL-2, IL-4, IL-15, IL-21 and CD40 ligand) in multiple culture conditions. Our results demonstrated that BCR engagement (anti-IgM ligation) concomitant to CD40 ligand, IL-4 and IL-21 stimulation allowed CLL cells proliferation ex vivo. In addition, we established a proliferative advantage for ZAP70 positive CLL cells, associated to an increased phosphorylation of ZAP70/SYK and STAT6. Moreover, the use of a tri-dimensional matrix of methylcellulose and the addition of TLR9 agonists further increased this proliferative response. This ex vivo model of BCR stimulation with T-derived cytokines is a relevant and efficient model for functional studies of CLL as well as lymphoproliferative malignancies.","['Schleiss, Cedric', 'Ilias, Wassila', 'Tahar, Ouria', 'Guler, Yonca', 'Miguet, Laurent', 'Mayeur-Rousse, Caroline', 'Mauvieux, Laurent', 'Fornecker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Toussaint, Elise', 'Herbrecht, Raoul', 'Bertrand, Frederic', 'Maumy-Bertrand, Myriam', 'Martin, Thierry', 'Fournel, Sylvie', 'Georgel, Philippe', 'Bahram, Seiamak', 'Vallat, Laurent']","['Schleiss C', 'Ilias W', 'Tahar O', 'Guler Y', 'Miguet L', 'Mayeur-Rousse C', 'Mauvieux L', 'Fornecker LM', 'Toussaint E', 'Herbrecht R', 'Bertrand F', 'Maumy-Bertrand M', 'Martin T', 'Fournel S', 'Georgel P', 'Bahram S', 'Vallat L']","[""Laboratoire d'ImmunoRhumatologie Moleculaire, INSERM UMR-S1109, LabEx Transplantex, Federation de Medecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg (FMTS), Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) OMICARE, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'ImmunoRhumatologie Moleculaire, INSERM UMR-S1109, LabEx Transplantex, Federation de Medecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg (FMTS), Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) OMICARE, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'ImmunoRhumatologie Moleculaire, INSERM UMR-S1109, LabEx Transplantex, Federation de Medecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg (FMTS), Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) OMICARE, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Plateau Technique de Biologie, Pole de Biologie, Nouvel Hopital Civil, Strasbourg, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, INSERM, IRFAC UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, INSERM, IRFAC UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital de Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, INSERM, IRFAC UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital de Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, INSERM, IRFAC UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital de Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, INSERM, IRFAC UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital de Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, INSERM, IRFAC UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital de Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, INSERM, IRFAC UMR-S1113, Strasbourg, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital de Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) OMICARE, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Mathematique Avancee IRMA, CNRS UMR 7501, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) OMICARE, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Mathematique Avancee IRMA, CNRS UMR 7501, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) OMICARE, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'CNRS UPR 9021 -

This consists of the metabolic inhibitor cytarabine (AraC) and the cytostatic topoisomerase 2 inhibitor daunorubucin (DNR). In light of the high chance for relapse, as well as the large heterogeneity, novel therapies are needed to improve patient outcome. We have tested the anti-AML activity of 15 novel compounds based on the scaffolds pyrrolo[2,3-a]carbazole-3-carbaldehyde, pyrazolo[3,4-c]carbazole, pyrazolo[4,3-a]phenanthridine, or pyrrolo[2,3-g]indazole. The compounds were inhibitors of Pim kinases, but could also have inhibitory activity against other protein kinases. Ser/Thr kinases like the Pim kinases have been identified as potential drug targets for AML therapy. The compound VS-II-173 induced AML cell death with EC50 below 5 mumol/L, and was 10 times less potent against nonmalignant cells. It perturbed Pim-kinase-mediated AML cell signaling, such as attenuation of Stat5 or MDM2 phosphorylation, and synergized with DNR to induce AML cell death. VS-II-173 induced cell death also in patients with AML blasts, including blast carrying high-risk FLT3-ITD mutations. Mutation of nucleophosmin-1 was associated with good response to VS-II-173. In conclusion new scaffolds for potential AML drugs have been explored. The selective activity toward patient AML blasts and AML cell lines of the pyrazolo-analogue VS-II-173 make it a promising drug candidate to be further tested in preclinical animal models for AML.","['Bjornstad, Ronja', 'Aesoy, Reidun', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Brenner, Annette K', 'Giraud, Francis', 'Dowling, Tara Helen', 'Gausdal, Gro', 'Moreau, Pascale', 'Doskeland, Stein Ove', 'Anizon, Fabrice', 'Herfindal, Lars']","['Bjornstad R', 'Aesoy R', 'Bruserud O', 'Brenner AK', 'Giraud F', 'Dowling TH', 'Gausdal G', 'Moreau P', 'Doskeland SO', 'Anizon F', 'Herfindal L']","['Department of Clinical Science, Centre for Pharmacy, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Hospital Pharmacy in western Norway, Bergen.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Centre for Pharmacy, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Sigma Clermont, ICCF, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'BerGenBio AS, Bergen, Norway.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Sigma Clermont, ICCF, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Sigma Clermont, ICCF, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Centre for Pharmacy, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. lars.herfindal@uib.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190124,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-17-1234 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-17-1234 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Mar;18(3):567-578. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-17-1234.

Thus, our knowledge about circumstances of diagnosis, outcome and treatment is limited, especially for children and young adults. We therefore performed a systematic review of cases, published since 2005, concerning patients aged below 20 years at the time of diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. We identified 396 cases of essential thrombocythemia and 75 of polycythemia vera. The median age at diagnosis was 9.3 and 12 years, respectively, and females constituted 57.6% and 45% of the groups, respectively. Half of the patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. The proportion of so-called triple negativity was high: 57% in essential thrombocythemia and 73% in polycythemia vera. The incidence of thrombosis during the follow-up was 9.3% in patients with polycythemia vera and less, 3.8%, in those with essential thrombocythemia. Venous events were predominant (84.2%), with hemorrhagic episodes being rarer (<5%). The risk of evolution also seemed low (2% to myelofibrosis and no reports of acute leukemia), but the median follow-up was only 50 months. Survival curves were not available. Half of the patients received an antithrombotic drug and 40.5% received a cytoreductive drug. All data should be analyzed with care because of the proportion of missing data (10.7% to 74.7%). This review highlights interesting points concerning this population of young patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, including that such patients were identified as negative for all common driver mutations, but also shows the need for larger contemporary cohorts with longer follow-up to assess the true prognosis of these patients.","['Ianotto, Jean-Christophe', 'Curto-Garcia, Natalia', 'Lauermanova, Marie', 'Radia, Deepti', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques', 'Harrison, Claire N']","['Ianotto JC', 'Curto-Garcia N', 'Lauermanova M', 'Radia D', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Harrison CN']","[""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust, London, UK."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancero-Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Brest, Brest, France."", ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust, London, UK."", ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust, London, UK."", 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust, London, UK."", ""Centre d'Investigation Clinique, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France."", ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust, London, UK claire.harrison@gstt.nhs.uk.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20190124,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC6669170,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/05/22 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.200832 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.200832 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Aug;104(8):1580-1588. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.200832.

The developmental/pathogenic contribution of the t(4;11)-resulting MLL-AF4 (MA4) and AF4-MLL (A4M) fusions remains unclear; MA4 is always expressed in patients with t(4;11)(+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but the reciprocal fusion A4M is expressed in only half of the patients. Because prenatal leukemogenesis manifests as impaired early hematopoietic differentiation, we took advantage of well-established human embryonic stem cell-based hematopoietic differentiation models to study whether the A4M fusion cooperates with MA4 during early human hematopoietic development. Co-expression of A4M and MA4 strongly promoted the emergence of hemato-endothelial precursors, both endothelial- and hemogenic-primed. Double fusion-expressing hemato-endothelial precursors specified into significantly higher numbers of both hematopoietic and endothelial-committed cells, irrespective of the differentiation protocol used and without hijacking survival/proliferation. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes and differentially enriched H3K79me3 genomic regions by RNA-sequencing and H3K79me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, respectively, confirmed a hematopoietic/endothelial cell differentiation signature in double fusion-expressing hemato-endothelial precursors. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis revealed a significant enrichment of H3K79 methylated regions specifically associated with HOX-A cluster genes in double fusion-expressing differentiating hematopoietic cells. Overall, these results establish a functional and molecular cooperation between MA4 and A4M fusions during human hematopoietic development.","['Bueno, Clara', 'Calero-Nieto, Fernando J', 'Wang, Xiaonan', 'Valdes-Mas, Rafael', 'Gutierrez-Aguera, Francisco', 'Roca-Ho, Heleia', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Real, Pedro J', 'Arambilet, David', 'Espinosa, Lluis', 'Torres-Ruiz, Raul', 'Agraz-Doblas, Antonio', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'de Boer, Jasper', 'Bigas, Anna', 'Gottgens, Bertie', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Bueno C', 'Calero-Nieto FJ', 'Wang X', 'Valdes-Mas R', 'Gutierrez-Aguera F', 'Roca-Ho H', 'Ayllon V', 'Real PJ', 'Arambilet D', 'Espinosa L', 'Torres-Ruiz R', 'Agraz-Doblas A', 'Varela I', 'de Boer J', 'Bigas A', 'Gottgens B', 'Marschalek R', 'Menendez P']","['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Spain cbueno@carrerasresearch.org pmenendez@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBER-ONC), ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, UK.', 'Dreamgenics S.L.

In infants, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains fatal, especially in patients with t(4;11), present in ~80% of cases. The pathogenesis of t(4;11)/KMT2A-AFF1(+) (MLL-AF4(+)) infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains difficult to model, and the pathogenic contribution in cancer of the reciprocal fusions resulting from derivative translocated-chromosomes remains obscure. Here, ""multi-layered"" genome-wide analyses and validation were performed on a total of 124 de novo cases of infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia uniformly diagnosed and treated according to the Interfant 99/06 protocol. These patients showed the most silent mutational landscape reported so far for any sequenced pediatric cancer. Recurrent mutations were exclusively found in K-RAS and N-RAS, were subclonal and were frequently lost at relapse, despite a larger number of non-recurrent/non-silent mutations. Unlike non-MLL-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, B-cell receptor repertoire analysis revealed minor, non-expanded B-cell clones in t(4;11)(+) infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and RNA-sequencing showed transcriptomic similarities between t(4;11)(+) infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and the most immature human fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, confirming a ""pre-VDJ"" fetal cellular origin for both t(4;11) and RAS (mut) The reciprocal fusion AF4-MLL was expressed in only 45% (19/43) of the t(4;11)(+) patients, and HOXA cluster genes are exclusively expressed in AF4-MLL-expressing patients. Importantly, AF4-MLL/HOXA-expressing patients had a significantly better 4-year event-free survival (62.4% vs 11.7%, P=0.001), and overall survival (73.7 vs 25.2%, P=0.016). AF4-MLL expression retained its prognostic significance when analyzed in a Cox model adjusting for risk stratification according to the Interfant-06 protocol based on age at diagnosis, white blood cell count and response to prednisone. This study has clinical implications for disease outcome and diagnostic risk-stratification of t(4;11)(+) infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Agraz-Doblas, Antonio', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Bashford-Rogers, Rachael', 'Roy, Anindita', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'Bardini, Michela', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Cazzaniga, Gianni', 'Moreno, Thaidy', 'Revilla, Carlos', 'Gut, Marta', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'Roberts, Irene', 'Pieters, Rob', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Stam, Ronald W']","['Agraz-Doblas A', 'Bueno C', 'Bashford-Rogers R', 'Roy A', 'Schneider P', 'Bardini M', 'Ballerini P', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Moreno T', 'Revilla C', 'Gut M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Roberts I', 'Pieters R', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Varela I', 'Menendez P', 'Stam RW']","['Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria (IBBTEC), Universidad de Cantabria-CSIC, Santander, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute-Campus Clinic, Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute-Campus Clinic, Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, UK.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, UK.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology, A.

As such, they regulate cancer cell invasion, dissemination and metastasis of solid tumors. In addition, their expression is associated with the gain of cancer stem cell properties and resistance to therapy. Using conditional loss-of-function mice, we previously demonstrated that Zeb2 also plays pivotal roles in hematopoiesis, controlling important cell fate decisions, lineage commitment and fidelity. In addition, upon Zeb2 overexpression, mice spontaneously develop immature T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we show that pre-leukemic Zeb2-overexpressing thymocytes are characterized by a differentiation delay at beta-selection due to aberrant activation of the interleukin-7 receptor signaling pathway. Notably, and in contrast to Lmo2-overexpressing thymocytes, these pre-leukemic Zeb2-overexpressing T-cell progenitors display no acquired self-renewal properties. Finally, Zeb2 activation in more differentiated T-cell precursor cells can also drive malignant T-cell development, suggesting that the early T-cell differentiation delay is not essential for Zeb2-mediated leukemic transformation. Altogether, our data suggest that Zeb2 and Lmo2 drive malignant transformation of immature T-cell progenitors via distinct molecular mechanisms.","['Goossens, Steven', 'Wang, Jueqiong', 'Tremblay, Cedric S', 'De Medts, Jelle', ""T'Sas, Sara"", 'Nguyen, Thao', 'Saw, Jesslyn', 'Haigh, Katharina', 'Curtis, David J', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Berx, Geert', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Haigh, Jody J']","['Goossens S', 'Wang J', 'Tremblay CS', 'De Medts J', ""T'Sas S"", 'Nguyen T', 'Saw J', 'Haigh K', 'Curtis DJ', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Berx G', 'Taghon T', 'Haigh JJ']","['Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium steven.goossens@ugent.be.', 'Department for Biomedical Molecular Biology, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research (IRC), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Mammalian Functional Genetics Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Stem Cell Research Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department for Biomedical Molecular Biology, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research (IRC), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Mammalian Functional Genetics Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Stem Cell Research Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Mammalian Functional Genetics Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Stem Cell Research Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department for Biomedical Molecular Biology, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research (IRC), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Mammalian Functional Genetics Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Rady Faulty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology (RIOH), Cancer Care Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190124,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC6669144,,2019/01/27 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.207837 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.207837 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Aug;104(8):1608-1616. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.207837.

It confers protection and promotes survival in response to metabolic/environmental stress, and is upregulated in response to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and chemotherapies. Autophagy is also known to sustain malignant cell growth and contributes to cancer stem cell survival when challenged by cytotoxic and/or targeted therapies, a potential mechanism of disease persistence and drug resistance that has gathered momentum. However, different types of human leukemia utilize autophagy in complex, context-specific manners, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this process involve multiple protein networks that will be discussed in this review. There is mounting preclinical evidence that targeting autophagy can enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies. Chloroquine and other lysosomal inhibitors have spurred initiation of clinical trials and demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy restores chemosensitivity of anticancer drugs, but with limited autophagy-dependent effects. Intriguingly, several autophagy-specific inhibitors, with better therapeutic indexes and lower toxicity, have been developed. Promising preclinical studies with novel combination approaches as well as potential challenges to effectively eradicate drug-resistant cells, particularly cancer stem cells, in human leukemia are also detailed in this review.","['Rothe, Katharina', 'Porter, Vanessa', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Rothe K', 'Porter V', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver V5Z 1L3, Canada. krothe@bccrc.ca.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver V6H 3N1, Canada. krothe@bccrc.ca.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver V6H 3N1, Canada. vporter@bcgsc.ca.', 'Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver V5Z 1L3, Canada. vporter@bcgsc.ca.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver V5Z 1L3, Canada. xjiang@bccrc.ca.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver V6H 3N1, Canada. xjiang@bccrc.ca.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver V5Z 1M9, Canada. xjiang@bccrc.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190122,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6387281,['The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],2019/01/27 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2019/01/26 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20030461 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20030461 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jan 22;20(3). pii: ijms20030461. doi: 10.3390/ijms20030461.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'autophagy', 'autophagy inhibitors', 'cancer stem cells', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'hematological malignancies', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cells']","['702786/Canadian Cancer Society', 'PJT156392/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8974-7340'],,,20190513,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of mutations have been reported in the L-ferritin subunit gene (FTL gene) that cause the following five diseases: (1) hereditary hyperferritinemia with cataract syndrome (HHCS), (2) neuroferritinopathy, a subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), (3) benign hyperferritinemia, (4) L-ferritin deficiency with autosomal dominant inheritance, and (5) L-ferritin deficiency with autosomal recessive inheritance. Defects in the FTL gene lead to abnormally high levels of serum ferritin (hyperferritinemia) in HHCS and benign hyperferritinemia, while low levels (hypoferritinemia) are present in neuroferritinopathy and in autosomal dominant and recessive L-ferritin deficiency. Iron disturbances as well as neuromuscular and cognitive deficits are present in some, but not all, of these diseases. Here, we identified two novel FTL variants that cause dominant L-ferritin deficiency and HHCS (c.375+2T > A and 36_42delCAACAGT, respectively), and one previously reported variant (Met1Val) that causes dominant L-ferritin deficiency. Globally, genetic changes in the FTL gene are responsible for multiple phenotypes and an accurate diagnosis is useful for appropriate treatment. To help in this goal, we included a diagnostic algorithm for the detection of diseases caused by defects in FTL gene.","['Cadenas, Beatriz', 'Fita-Torro, Josep', 'Bermudez-Cortes, Mar', 'Hernandez-Rodriguez, Ines', 'Fuster, Jose Luis', 'Llinares, Maria Esther', 'Galera, Ana Maria', 'Romero, Julia Lee', 'Perez-Montero, Santiago', 'Tornador, Cristian', 'Sanchez, Mayka']","['Cadenas B', 'Fita-Torro J', 'Bermudez-Cortes M', 'Hernandez-Rodriguez I', 'Fuster JL', 'Llinares ME', 'Galera AM', 'Romero JL', 'Perez-Montero S', 'Tornador C', 'Sanchez M']","['Whole Genix SL., 08021 Barcelona, Spain.

In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the high frequency with which patients achieve first remission, and the diffuse nature of the disease throughout the periphery, makes immunotherapy particularly appealing following induction and consolidation therapy, using chemotherapy, and where possible stem cell transplantation. Immunotherapy could be used to remove residual disease, including leukaemic stem cells from the farthest recesses of the body, reducing, if not eliminating, the prospect of relapse. The identification of novel antigens that exist at disease presentation and can act as targets for immunotherapy have also proved useful in helping us to gain a better understand of the biology that belies AML. It appears that there is an additional function of leukaemia associated antigens as biomarkers of disease state and survival.

However, T cells recognizing WT1 occur in low frequencies in the peripheral blood of healthy donors, limiting potential therapeutic possibilities. Tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP) is known to inhibit heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has been shown to boost the activation and proliferation of human virus-specific T cells. We analyzed the influence of this effect on the generation of WT1-specific T cells and developed strategies for generating quantities of these cells from healthy donors, sufficient for adoptive T-cell therapies. HO-1 inhibition with SnMP increased WT1-specific T-cell frequencies in 13 (26%) of 50 healthy donors. To assess clinical applicability, we measured the enrichment efficiency of SnMP-treated WT1-specific T cells in response to a WT1-specific peptide pool and a HLA-A*02:01-restricted WT1 peptide by cytokine secretion assay. SnMP treatment resulted in a 28-fold higher enrichment efficacy with equal functionality. In conclusion, pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 activity with SnMP results in more efficient generation of functionally active WT1-specific T cells. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potentials of inhibiting HO-1 with SnMP to enhance antigen-specific T-cell responses in the treatment of cancer patients with WT1-positive disease.","['Schillingmann, Damaris A', 'Riese, Sebastian B', 'Vijayan, Vijith', 'Tischer-Zimmermann, Sabine', 'Schmetzer, Helga', 'Maecker-Kolhoff, Britta', 'Blasczyk, Rainer', 'Immenschuh, Stephan', 'Eiz-Vesper, Britta']","['Schillingmann DA', 'Riese SB', 'Vijayan V', 'Tischer-Zimmermann S', 'Schmetzer H', 'Maecker-Kolhoff B', 'Blasczyk R', 'Immenschuh S', 'Eiz-Vesper B']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. damaris.schillingmann@googlemail.com.', 'Integrated Research and Treatment Center (IFB-Tx), Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. damaris.schillingmann@googlemail.com.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. riese.sebastian@mh-hannover.de.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. vijayan.vijith@mh-hannover.de.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. tischer-zimmermann.sabine@mh-hannover.de.', 'Integrated Research and Treatment Center (IFB-Tx), Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. tischer-zimmermann.sabine@mh-hannover.de.', 'Department for Hematopoetic Transplantations, Med.

PPARs are important regulators of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and immune response. Their possible role in the female reproductive tract was demonstrated. In the present study, cultured luminal epithelial (LE) and stromal (ST) cells of the porcine endometrium were used to examine (1) the effect of conceptus exposed medium (CEM) on mRNA and protein expression and DNA binding activity of PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG isoforms, and (2) the effect of PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG agonists on the expression of selected genes, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. The addition of CEM stimulated PPARA expression and DNA binding activity of this isoform in LE and ST cells (P<0.05). Increased expression of PPARD mRNA in the presence of CEM was detected in ST cells (P<0.05), while the concentration of PPARG transcripts decreased in response to CEM in both cell types (P<0.05). LE and ST cells of the pig endometrium possess PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG proteins, with clear nuclear staining visible predominately in ST cells. In LE cells, activation of PPARG with 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin(PG)J2 down-regulated the expression of genes encoding amino acid transporter 1 (SLC38A1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and enzymes involved in PG synthesis (P<0.05). In ST cells, activation of PPARD isoform with both agonists used (L-165,041 and cPGI2) and PPARG isoform with 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2 increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) mRNA expression (P<0.05). Moreover, GW9578 (PPARA agonist) and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2 stimulated glucose transporter 1 (SLC2A1) gene expression in ST cells. 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2 was also effective in up-regulation of the ratio of BAX/BCL2 mRNA expression and active caspase-3 concentration in ST cells (P<0.05). Finally, GW9578 stimulated LE and ST cell proliferation, while rosiglitazone (PPARG agonist) increased the number of viable ST but not LE cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that conceptus products differentially modulate PPARs expression and activity in the porcine endometrium.

Twenty-two patients with either primary refractory (n=10) or relapsed refractory (n=12) AML in active disease status received a transplant from haploidentical donors. The preparative regimen included cytoreduction with fludarabine and cytarabine and subsequent myeloablative conditioning with treosulfan and thiotepa. Antithymocyte globulin was substituted with tocilizumab in all patients and also with abatacept in 10 patients. Grafts were peripheral blood stem cells engineered by alphabeta T cell and CD19 depletion. Post-transplantation prophylactic therapy included infusion of donor lymphocytes, composed of a CD45RA-depleted fraction with or without a hypomethylating agent. Complete remission was achieved in 21 patients (95%). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 18%, and the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 23%. At 2 years, transplantation-related mortality was 9%, relapse rate was 42%, event-free survival was 49%, and overall survival was 53%. Our data suggest that alphabeta T cell-depleted haploidentical HSCT provides a reasonable chance of long-term survival in a cohort of children with chemorefractory AML and creates a solid basis for further improvement.","['Shelikhova, Larisa', 'Ilushina, Maria', 'Shekhovtsova, Zhanna', 'Shasheleva, Daria', 'Khismatullina, Rimma', 'Kurnikova, Elena', 'Pershin, Dmitriy', 'Balashov, Dmitriy', 'Radygina, Svetlana', 'Trakhtman, Pavel', 'Kalinina, Irina', 'Muzalevskii, Yakov', 'Kazachenok, Alexei', 'Zaharova, Viktoria', 'Brilliantova, Varvara', 'Olshanskaya, Yulia', 'Panferova, Agnesa', 'Zerkalenkova, Elena', 'Baidildina, Dina', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Rumyantsev, Alexander', 'Maschan, Alexei', 'Maschan, Michael']","['Shelikhova L', 'Ilushina M', 'Shekhovtsova Z', 'Shasheleva D', 'Khismatullina R', 'Kurnikova E', 'Pershin D', 'Balashov D', 'Radygina S', 'Trakhtman P', 'Kalinina I', 'Muzalevskii Y', 'Kazachenok A', 'Zaharova V', 'Brilliantova V', 'Olshanskaya Y', 'Panferova A', 'Zerkalenkova E', 'Baidildina D', 'Novichkova G', 'Rumyantsev A', 'Maschan A', 'Maschan M']","['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Blood Bank and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Processing Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Transplantation Biology and Immunotherapy, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Blood Bank and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Processing Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Blood Bank and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Processing Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Blood Bank and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Processing Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia;

Few reports have evaluated deferasirox in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We investigated the impact of deferasirox after allo-HSCT in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Of 326 consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT in remission, analysis of 198 patients not receiving deferasirox revealed the negative prognostic effect of hyperferritinemia (>/=1000 ng/mL) before and after allo-HSCT on survival mainly due to increase in relapse. Of 276 patients with hyperferritinemia at 1 month after allo-HSCT, 128 patients (46%) received deferasirox. Deferasirox induced a faster decline in serum ferritin level with a manageable safety profile, which significantly reduced relapse rather than nonrelapse mortality, resulting in better survival compared to patients not receiving deferasirox. Of note, the deferasirox group had a significantly higher incidence of chronic graft-vs-host disease, indicating improved graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effects evidenced by the presence of suppressed regulatory T cells and sustained higher proportion of NK cells in peripheral blood. This study firstly demonstrates the improved survival and restoration of GVL effects of patients with AML by deferasirox, which also clarifies the detrimental effect of hyperferritinemia through after allo-HSCT.","['Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Hahn, A-Reum', 'Lee, Tai-Hyang', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Cho BS', 'Jeon YW', 'Hahn AR', 'Lee TH', 'Park SS', 'Yoon JH', 'Lee SE', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Kim HJ']","[""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190124,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6382990,,2019/01/25 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1928 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Feb;8(2):501-514. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1928.

Our study explores the association between parental education and childhood cancer survival. METHODS: The specialized Childhood Cancer Registry of the Piedmont region in Italy provided data on all the cases (aged 0-14) diagnosed with cancer in the period 1976-2011 who resided in the city of Turin (capital of the Piedmont region) at least once since 1971. Information on parental education was extracted from the Turin Longitudinal Study by record linkage. The association between parental educational level and survival was estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: The study included 949 children. We observed a disadvantage in the overall survival for children of less educated mothers. No such effect was observed for paternal education. The effect of maternal education was particularly strong for central nervous system tumors (hazard ratios, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-8.0). A similar effect, though smaller in magnitude, was observed for leukemia and embryonal tumors, whereas the estimates for lymphoma were imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows an association between maternal educational level and survival in children with central nervous system tumors, a diagnosis that often requires long-lasting treatment and special care. Giving support to the families of affected children to provide them the optimal care has the potential to improve children's cancer treatment outcomes.","['Isaevska, Elena', 'Popovic, Maja', 'Alessi, Daniela', 'Mosso, Maria Luisa', 'Sacerdote, Carlotta', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Pastore, Guido', 'Rosso, Tiziana', 'Zengarini, Nicolas', 'Dockerty, John', 'Merletti, Franco', 'Maule, Milena']","['Isaevska E', 'Popovic M', 'Alessi D', 'Mosso ML', 'Sacerdote C', 'Magnani C', 'Pastore G', 'Rosso T', 'Zengarini N', 'Dockerty J', 'Merletti F', 'Maule M']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Piedmont Cancer Registry, Biella and Vercelli Provinces, Epidemiology Unit, ASL VC, Vercelli, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Unit of Medical Statistics and Cancer Epidemiology, CPO Piemonte and University of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Epidemiology Unit, ASL TO3 Piedmont Region, Grugliasco, Italy.', 'Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago, P O Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190124,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,,2019/01/25 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27616 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 May;66(5):e27616. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27616.

PROCEDURE: Central American patients with newly diagnosed stage I or II B-NHL received a modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) regimen including a prephase (prednisone, cyclophosphamide) followed by A/B/A courses (A: cytarabine, dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, methotrexate, and intrathecal therapy; B: cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and intrathecal therapy). Those with stage III or IV NHL received additional courses (B/A/B), intensified for stage IV disease by additional vincristine and methotrexate doses. Patients in poor condition received a second prephase treatment before their chemotherapy courses. RESULTS: Between March 2004 and June 2016, of 405 patients with B-NHL, 386 (109 females) were eligible for treatment. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 177 cases (47.4%) and characterized the disease as mature B-cell lymphoma. Stage distribution was as follows: I/II, 31 (8.1%); III, 252 (65.3%); IV, 93 (24.1%); 10 (2.6%) not available. The 3-year overall survival was 70% for the whole group (86% for stages I/II, 75% for stage III, 58% for stage IV). Events included death during induction (34 patients, 8.8%), relapse/progression (46, 11.9%), death in remission (9, 2.3%), second malignancy (1, 0.26%), and death of unknown cause (1, 0.26%). Twenty-three (6%) patients abandoned or refused therapy.

The patient presented disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute kidney injury before induction therapy was conducted. CVVHD was performed and ATO was initiated. Species of ATO metabolites in plasma and effluent were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Plasma concentrations of As(III) , monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid with CVVHD were lower than those without CVVHD. Area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to the last sample with quantifiable concentration of As(III) without CVVHD was significantly higher than that with CVVHD (292.10 ng h/mL vs 195.86 ng h/mL, P = .037), which were not observed for monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid.

The most frequent life-threatening adverse events after CART infusion are cytokine release syndrome and CAR-related encephalopathy syndrome, which can occur within hours or days after administration. IL-6 released by macrophages and monocytes plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cytokine release syndrome and CAR-related encephalopathy syndrome, and IL-6 blockade and steroids contribute to fast resolution of symptoms. Critical care management plays an important role in patients receiving CARTs, as up to half of patients might need an admission to the ICU and lifesaving interventions. As new treatment indications and CART constructs enter the clinic, the number of patients requiring ICU admission will rapidly increase, with profound consequences for the use of ICU resources, training requirements, clinical expertise, multidisciplinary collaboration, and hospital organization.

Throughout the years, many studies have described the functional relevance of CD5 as a modulator of T and B cell receptor signaling. However, it has not been until recent years that CD5 has emerged as a functional receptor in other areas of the immune system. Here, we review some of the most important aspects of CD5 as a modulator of TCR and BCR signaling, cell survival receptor both in T and B cells during health and disease, as well as the newly discovered roles of this receptor in thymocyte selection, T cell effector differentiation, and immune tolerance. CD5 was found to promote T cell survival by protecting autoreactive T cell from activation-induced cell death, to promote de novo induction of regulatory T cells in the periphery, to modulate Th17 and Th2 differentiation, and to modulate immune responses by modulating dendritic cell functions. CD5 is overexpressed in Tregs and Bregs, which are fundamental to maintain immune homeostasis. The newly established roles of CD5 in modulating different aspects of immune responses identify this receptor as an immune checkpoint modulator, and therefore it could be used as a target for immune intervention in different pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune diseases or infections.","['Burgueno-Bucio, Erica', 'Mier-Aguilar, Carlos A', 'Soldevila, Gloria']","['Burgueno-Bucio E', 'Mier-Aguilar CA', 'Soldevila G']","['Department of Immunology, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Immunology, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Immunology, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190124,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,,2019/01/25 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.MR0618-226R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 May;105(5):891-904. doi: 10.1002/JLB.MR0618-226R.

METHODS: A total of 170 children with AML were given MAE induction therapy, and the complications and remission rate were analyzed after treatment. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.33:1 and the mean age was 7.4 years (range 1-15 years). Leukocyte count at diagnosis was 29.52x10(9)/L [range (0.77-351)x10(9)/L]. Of all children, 2 had M0-AML, 24 had M2-AML, 2 had M4-AML, 48 had M5-AML, 3 had M6-AML, 7 had M7-AML, 69 had AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22), and 15 had AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22). The most common complication was infection (158/170, 92.9%). Among these 158 patients, 22 (13.9%) had agranulocytosis with pyrexia (with no definite focus of infection), and 136 (86.1%) had definite focus of infection (including bloodstream infection). Other complications included non-infectious diarrhea, bleeding, and drug-induced hepatitis. Treatment-related mortality was observed in 10 children, among whom 8 had severe infection, 1 had multiple organ failure, and 1 had respiratory failure. Remission rate was evaluated for 156 children and the results showed a complete remission rate of 85.3%, a partial remission rate of 4.5%, and a non-remission rate of 10.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Induction therapy with the MAE regimen helps to achieve a good remission rate in children with AML after one course of treatment. Infection is the main complication and a major cause of treatment-related mortality.","['Chen, Xiao-Yan', 'Ruan, Min', 'Zhao, Bei-Bei', 'Wang, Shu-Chun', 'Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Guo, Ye', 'Yang, Wen-Yu', 'Zou, Yao', 'Chen, Yu-Mei', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Chen XY', 'Ruan M', 'Zhao BB', 'Wang SC', 'Chen XJ', 'Zhang L', 'Guo Y', 'Yang WY', 'Zou Y', 'Chen YM', 'Zhu XF']","['Department of Pediatric Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China. xfzhu@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,PMC7390179,,2019/01/25 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2019.01.005 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Jan;21(1):24-28.,,,,,,,,20190409,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone', 'Remission Induction']","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we reported a novel kind of artificial antibody, the cell-imprinted hydrogel with site-directed modification of aptamers (APT-CIH) to achieve the specific capture of CTCs. Cell-imprinted sites not only could be used to recognize target cells but also could be used as efficient scaffolds for assembling aptamers to enhance the capture efficiency and selectivity. Due to the synergistic effect of conformation recognition and multivalent interaction between the aptamers and target cells, APT-CIH showed high capture efficiency and selectivity to SMMC-7721 cells. In the coexistence of the 1000 times leukemia Jurkat cells, the enrichment factor of APT-CIH could reach as high as 21.6 +/- 3.1 toward target cells, while that relied only on cell imprinting or aptamer affinity was 8.1 +/- 5.0 or 10.1 +/- 1.3, respectively.

Patients who discontinue ruxolitinib have a dismal outcome, and this is, therefore, an area of significant unmet need. Given the central role that JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation plays in disease pathogenesis, there have been many other JAK inhibitors tested, but most have been abandoned, for a variety of reasons. The JAK2-selective inhibitor fedratinib has recently been resurrected, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the failed JAK1/2 inhibitor momelotinib, which possibly improves anemia. Pacritinib, a non-myelosuppressive JAK2-selective inhibitor, is currently in a dose-ranging study mandated by regulatory authorities. A plethora of other targeted agents, most backed by preclinical data, are in various stages of investigation. These include epigenetic and immune therapies, agents targeting cellular survival, metabolic and apoptotic pathways, the cell cycle, DNA repair, and protein folding and degradation, among others. However, at this time, none of these is close to registration or even in a pivotal trial, illustrating the difficulties in recapitulating the clinical disease in preclinical models. Most current clinical trials are testing the addition of a novel agent to ruxolitinib, either in the frontline setting or in the context of an insufficient response to ruxolitinib, or attempting to study new drugs in the second-line, ""ruxolitinib failure"" setting. Emerging data supports the addition of azacitidine to ruxolitinib in some patients. Other strategies have focused on improving cytopenias, through amelioration of bone marrow fibrosis or other mechanisms. This is important, because cytopenias are the commonest reason for ruxolitinib interruption and/or dose reduction, and dose optimization of ruxolitinib is tied to its survival benefit. The activin receptor ligand trap, sotatercept, and the anti-fibrotic agent, PRM-151, have shown promise in this regard.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Alfayez, Mansour', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Alfayez M', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. pbose@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20190124,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,,,2019/01/25 06:00,2020/03/26 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-019-0604-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-019-0604-y [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2019 Jan 24;20(1):5. doi: 10.1007/s11864-019-0604-y.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Anemia', '*Bone marrow fibrosis', '*JAK inhibitors', '*Myelofibrosis', '*Targeted therapies', '*Treatment']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,20200325,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines']","['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the standard of care in the frontline setting for fit patients is TKI in combination with chemotherapy. Age-adjusted chemotherapy or corticosteroids alone have been used with TKIs in elderly patients with comorbidities with modest long-term benefit. The primary goal of treatment is the achievement of early deep molecular remission as the achievement of complete molecular remission (CMR) at 3 months has been demonstrated to be predictive of higher long-term survival. The probability of attaining this goal by a more potent TKIs like dasatinib or ponatinib is higher, thus we recommend the use of second- or third-generation TKIs over imatinib. Clinicians should be aware of possible fatal cardiovascular events mainly related to ponatinib. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) should still be considered in first remission, especially for younger patients treated with imatinib combination therapy. A subset of patients achieving CMR at 3 months may be able to continue consolidation and maintenance with chemotherapy and TKI without the need for alloHSCT. Because of higher risk of relapses in the central nervous system, intrathecal chemoprophylaxis is mandatory for all patients. New strategies incorporating novel agents, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific monoclonal antibodies, potent TKIs, and CAR T cells are under investigation.","['Abou Dalle, Iman', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Abou Dalle I', 'Jabbour E', 'Short NJ', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd. Unit 0428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd. Unit 0428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd. Unit 0428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd. Unit 0428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190124,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,,,2019/01/25 06:00,2020/03/26 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-019-0603-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-019-0603-z [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2019 Jan 24;20(1):4. doi: 10.1007/s11864-019-0603-z.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*BCR-ABL', '*Blinatumomab', '*Inotuzumab', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",['K12 CA088084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,20200325,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cat had been administered oral spinosad (140 mg; 33.5 mg/kg) 48 h prior to the onset of clinical signs, and an oral anthelmintic containing milbemycin oxime (16 mg; 3.8 mg/kg) and praziquantel (40 mg; 9.6 mg/kg) 12 h before the onset of clinical signs. On physical examination, dull-to-obtunded mentation, tetraparesis, ataxia and mild tremors of facial, limb and trunk muscles were noted.

The results of a complete blood count, urine culture and serology for feline leukaemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus and cryptococcal antigen were negative. The patient was monitored in hospital and all clinical signs resolved within 24 h. Relevance and novel information: The neurological signs in this case were consistent with macrocyclic lactone neurotoxicity, which is suspected to have occurred from an adverse drug interaction between spinosad and milbemycin oxime.

Biomarkers are required to predict resistance to EGT in myeloid malignancies, which together with the delineation of associated molecular mechanisms, may provide additional understanding for novel treatment strategies when investigating resistance to EGT. The present study aimed to investigate the in vivo effects of EGT on the expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and orphan nuclear receptor NUR77 with clinical responses in patients with myeloid malignancies. In addition, in vitro and in vivo characterization of the effects of EGT on the expression of NF-kappaB and Bcl-xL, potential downstream targets of PD-L1 reverse signaling, were evaluated to determine components of the molecular mechanism responsible for these effects. The in vivo effects of EGT on the expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and a previously identified molecular marker of response to EGT, NUR77 was characterized in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with either azacytidine (Aza) alone or a combination of Aza and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) LBH-589 during the first cycle of therapy. The correlation of clinical responses to treatment with EGT with the expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and NUR77 demonstrated that the induction of PD-L1 mRNA levels was associated with resistance to EGT despite the concurrent augmentation of NUR77 expression. The characterization of potential downstream effector molecules of reverse PD-L1 signaling identified EGT-mediated induction of Bcl-xL and NF-kappaB mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential anti-apoptotic molecular mechanism was responsible for PD-L1-mediated resistance to EGT. Taken together, these observations suggest that enhanced PD-L1 expression may confer resistance to EGT over known EGT response markers in myeloid malignancies, and provides a potential molecular mechanism involving the modulation of effectors of PD-L1 reverse signaling, which may in-part, be responsible for these effects.","['Liu, Hongbin', 'Hu, Yunshan', 'Rimoldi, Rafael', 'Von Hagt, Chloe', 'Khong, Edmund W C', 'Lee, Nora', 'Flemming, Shaun', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Dear, Anthony E']","['Liu H', 'Hu Y', 'Rimoldi R', 'Von Hagt C', 'Khong EWC', 'Lee N', 'Flemming S', 'Spencer A', 'Dear AE']","['Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Eastern Health Clinical School, Box Hill Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181217,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC6341830,,2019/01/25 06:00,2019/01/25 06:01,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2018.9841 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-9841 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2019 Feb;17(2):2543-2550. doi: 10.3892/ol.2018.9841.

The GSE67684 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and lncRNAs (DELs) between Days 0, 8, 15 and 33 were isolated using random variance model corrective analysis of variance. Overlapping DEGs and DELs were clustered using Cluster 3.0. Bio-functional enrichment analysis was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Interactions between lncRNAs and mRNAs were calculated using dynamic simulations, and interactions among mRNAs were predicted using the STRING database. lncRNA-mRNA and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were visualized using Cytoscape. Subsequently, the expression levels of lncRNAs in biological samples from children with or without cALL were validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A total of 593 overlapping DEGs and 21 DELs were identified. After clustering, Profile 26 exhibited a continuously increasing temporal trend, whereas Profile 1 exhibited a continuous decreasing trend. Upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in 1,825 GO terms and 166 KEGG pathways, whereas downregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in 196 GO terms and 90 KEGG pathways. The lncRNAs NONHSAT027612.2 and NONHSAT134556.2 were the top two regulators in the lncRNA-mRNA network. Toll-like receptor 4, cathepsin G, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 and cathepsin S may be considered the hub genes of the PPI network. RT-qPCR results indicated that the expression levels of the lncRNAs NONHSAT027612.2 and NONHSAT134556.2 were significantly elevated in the blood and bone marrow of patients with cALL compared with the controls. In conclusion, the lncRNAs NONHSAT027612.2 and NONHSAT134556.2 may serve important roles in the pathogenesis of cALL via regulating immune response-associated pathways.","['Li, Sheng', 'Bian, Hongliang', 'Cao, Yizhi', 'Juan, Chenxia', 'Cao, Qian', 'Zhou, Guoping', 'Fang, Yongjun']","['Li S', 'Bian H', 'Cao Y', 'Juan C', 'Cao Q', 'Zhou G', 'Fang Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, P.R.

ALK is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p23) and exchange of chromosomal segments with other genes, including nucleophosmin (NPM), echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and Trk-fused gene (TFG), readily occurs. Such chromosomal translocation results in the formation of chimeric X-ALK fusion oncoproteins, which possess potential oncogenic functions due to constitutive activation of ALK kinase. These proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including lymphoma, lung cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs), Spitz tumors, renal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, digestive tract cancer, breast cancer, leukemia and ovarian carcinoma. Targeting of ALK fusion oncoproteins exclusively, or in combination with ALK kinase inhibitors including crizotinib, is the most common therapeutic strategy. As is often the case for small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), drug resistance eventually develops via an adaptive secondary mutation in the ALK fusion oncogene, or through engagement of alternative signaling mechanisms. The updated mechanisms of a variety of ALK fusions in tumorigenesis, proliferation and metastasis, in addition to targeted therapies are discussed below.","['Cao, Zhifa', 'Gao, Qian', 'Fu, Meixian', 'Ni, Nan', 'Pei, Yuting', 'Ou, Wen-Bin']","['Cao Z', 'Gao Q', 'Fu M', 'Ni N', 'Pei Y', 'Ou WB']","['Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Silkworm Bioreactors and Biomedicine, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310018, P.R.

Proliferation of RBL-1 cells was determined using an MTT assay. Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned randomly into three groups of 10 animals each, where the positive control group was administered an intravenous injection of normal saline, the negative control group was administered 1x10(6) RBL-1 cells and the treatment group was administered with 1x10(6) RBL-1 cells and then benzoxime (50 mg/kg/day) for 1 week. Increased dosage of benzoxime reduced RBL-1 cell viability from 92 at 2 microM to at microM after h. Benzoxime treatment prevented the loss of body weight in the rats with leukemia. Compared with the negative control rats, the body weight was determined to be significantly reduced (P<0.05) in the positive control rats. The weight of the spleen and liver was determined to be significantly increased (P<0.02) in the positive control rats and the benzoxime-treated rats compared with that in the negative control group on day 35 of RBL-1 cell implantation. Analysis of leukocytes in rats on day 35 demonstrated a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the cluster of differentiation (CD)11b and CD45 level in the positive control group compared with that in the negative control group. The level of CD11b and CD45 was determined to be similar in the rats in the benzoxime treatment and negative control groups. Analysis of the level of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and blood urea nitrogen indicated that all three components exhibited no significant changes in the rats following treatment with benzoxime compared with the component levels in the negative control group. The levels of these three components were in the normal range in rats treated with benzoxime on day 35 of cell implantation. These data demonstrated that the liver and kidneys are not influenced by benzoxime in rats with leukemia. In summary, the present study demonstrated that benzoxime efficiently prevents leukemia growth without inducing any harmful effects in rat models through targeting CD11b and CD45 level; thus, benzoxime should be evaluated further regarding its use in the treatment of leukemia.","['Li, Yingchun', 'Wang, Huihan', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Zhang, Guojun', 'Yang, Ying', 'Liu, Zhuogang']","['Li Y', 'Wang H', 'Zhang R', 'Zhang G', 'Yang Y', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110021, P.R.

Tanshinone IIA (Tan-IIA) possesses anticancer activities through inducing the apoptosis of tumor cells. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the ability of Tan-IIA to induce apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and to examine the potential mechanism underlying its activity. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were used to analyze the therapeutic effects of Tan-IIA on ovarian cancer. It was demonstrated that Tan-IIA significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of human ovarian cancer cells. Tan-IIA significantly increased the apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells through cleavage activation of caspases-3, caspase-8 and caspases-9. In addition, Tan-IIA treatment decreased the expression of mitochondrial-protective B-cell lymphoma 2-like protein 2 (Bcl-w) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 long (Mcl-1L) in ovarian cancer cells. Tan-IIA also reduced the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in human ovarian cancer cells. A specific PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) enhanced the Tan-IIA-inhibited expression of AKT and JNK. The overexpression of PI3K negated the Tan-IIA-inhibited expression of AKT and JNK, and eliminated the Tan-IIA-induced apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells. Additionally, the in vivo assay showed that Tan-IIA treatment inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer through increasing the apoptosis of tumor cells. In conclusion, these findings suggested that the induction of apoptosis by Tan-IIA involves the PI3K/AKT/JNK signaling pathways in ovarian cancer.","['Zhang, Xian', 'Zhou, Yong', 'Gu, Ying-Er']","['Zhang X', 'Zhou Y', 'Gu YE']","[""Department of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, P.R.

Pemetrexed is a clinical antifolate therapeutic agent with anticancer properties. The present study aimed to understand whether pemetrexed is able to exert anticancer effects on ESCC cells, and to determine the underlying molecular mechanism. ESCC cells were treated with pemetrexed and cell survival was assessed with MTT assays. The cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated using flow cytometry analysis, and proteins were detected using western blotting. It was demonstrated that pemetrexed inhibited cell survival and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human ESCC cells. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1/induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 axis is involved in intrinsic apoptosis induced by pemetrexed. The protein expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha, binding immunoglobulin protein and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein were upregulated following treatment with pemetrexed. These results suggest that pemetrexed may induce an endoplasmic reticulum stress response while activating intrinsic apoptosis.

There are no established beneficial interventions to treat AML in elderly patients. It is unclear whether outpatient delivery of palliative chemotherapies could reduce the burden of disease and hospitalisation for this group. Aims: To compare overall survival, response to treatment and supportive care needs between inpatient and outpatient-based treatments for AML in elderly patients. Materials & Methods: We undertook a retrospective cohort study in the Haematology Department at Belfast City Hospital comparing overall survival (OS), treatment responses and supportive care needs between inpatient and outpatient treatments for AML in elderly patients. Consecutive entrants to outpatient and inpatient based clinical trials between February 2013 and January 2017 were included. Case notes, chemotherapy charts, clinic letters, blood bank and electronic care records were analysed. Results: OS and rates of CR (complete remission), CRi (CR with incomplete count recovery) and PR (partial response) was not significantly different between inpatient and outpatient regimens with a median OS of 201 vs. 124 days, respectively. No response was observed in 35% of patients in the inpatient group compared with 65% of the outpatient group, however this did not reach significance. Of patients who achieved CR/CRi in the outpatient group, 75% relapsed at a median of 271 days, compared with 60% of the inpatient group at a median of 209 days. At least one grade 3-4 toxicity was experienced by 90% and 83.3% of inpatient and outpatient groups, respectively. There was no difference in six common grade 3-4 toxicities. Patients on the outpatient regimen spent fewer days in hospital but had a median packed red cell use of more than twice that of the inpatient group. No difference was noted in infections, days on antibiotics or platelet use. Discussion: Our data suggests that outpatient chemotherapy is safe and can reduce hospitalisation for elderly patients with AML, without a decline in OS or response rates. These results provide an important rationale to test the comparative efficacy of outpatient chemotherapy. Chemotherapy related toxicities remain a significant source of morbidity in this population and highlight the need to develop novel, targeted therapies for this age group.","['Daly, A B', 'Cuthbert, R', 'Finnegan, D', 'Arnold, C', 'Craddock, C', 'McMullin, M F']","['Daly AB', 'Cuthbert R', 'Finnegan D', 'Arnold C', 'Craddock C', 'McMullin MF']","['Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, N.

An international overview.,1173-1183,10.1038/s41375-018-0341-4 [doi],"There are different BCR-ABL1 fusion genes that are translated into proteins that are different from each other, yet all leukemogenic, causing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Their frequency has never been systematically investigated. In a series of 45503 newly diagnosed CML patients reported from 45 countries, it was found that the proportion of e13a2 (also known as b2a2) and of e14a2 (also known as b3a2), including the cases co-expressing e14a2 and e13a2, was 37.9% and 62.1%, respectively. The proportion of these two transcripts was correlated with gender, e13a2 being more frequent in males (39.2%) than in females (36.2%), was correlated with age, decreasing from 39.6% in children and adolescents down to 31.6% in patients >/= 80 years old, and was not constant worldwide. Other, rare transcripts were reported in 666/34561 patients (1.93%). The proportion of rare transcripts was associated with gender (2.27% in females and 1.69% in males) and with age (from 1.79% in children and adolescents up to 3.84% in patients >/= 80 years old). These data show that the differences in proportion are not by chance. This is important, as the transcript type is a variable that is suspected to be of prognostic importance for response to treatment, outcome of treatment, and rate of treatment-free remission.","['Baccarani, Michele', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Albeer, Ali', 'Pfirrmann, Markus']","['Baccarani M', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Rosti G', 'Soverini S', 'Albeer A', 'Pfirrmann M']","['Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

Since we previously identified high expression of calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with high EVI1 expression, we here characterized the function of CRLR in hematopoiesis. Since higher expression of CRLR and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) was identified in immature hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) cells, we focused on calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a specific ligand for the CRLR/RAMP1 complex. To elucidate the role of CGRP in hematopoiesis, Ramp1-deficient (Ramp1(-/-)) mice were used. The steady-state hematopoiesis was almost maintained in Ramp1(-/-) mice; however, the BM repopulation capacity of Ramp1(-/-) mice was significantly decreased, and the transplanted Ramp1(-/-) BM mononuclear cells had low proliferation capacity with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell apoptosis. Thus, CGRP is important for maintaining hematopoiesis during temporal exposures with proliferative stress. Moreover, continuous CGRP exposure to mice for two weeks induced a reduction in the number of BM immature hematopoietic cells along with differentiated myeloid cells. Since CGRP is known to be increased under inflammatory conditions to regulate immune responses, hematopoietic exhaustion by continuous CGRP secretion under chronic inflammatory conditions is probably one of the important mechanisms of anti-inflammatory responses.","['Suekane, Akira', 'Saito, Yusuke', 'Nakahata, Shingo', 'Ichikawa, Tomonaga', 'Ogoh, Honami', 'Tsujikawa, Kazutake', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Suekane A', 'Saito Y', 'Nakahata S', 'Ichikawa T', 'Ogoh H', 'Tsujikawa K', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan. kmorishi@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190123,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6344543,,2019/01/25 06:00,2020/06/26 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-36796-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-36796-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jan 23;9(1):429. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-36796-0.,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1870-9790'],,,20200625,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide/genetics/*immunology', 'Calcitonin Receptor-Like Protein/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/immunology', 'Receptor Activity-Modifying Protein 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics/*immunology']","['0 (Calcitonin Receptor-Like Protein)', '0 (Ramp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptor Activity-Modifying Protein 1)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To get some insight into this process, AGAP2 proximal promoter was cloned and characterised using reporter assays. We have identified SP1 as a transcription factor bound to AGAP2 promoter and required for AGAP2 expression in two different types of cancer cells (KU812, a chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line; and DU145, a prostate cancer cell line): silencing SP1 decreased AGAP2 protein levels. We have also found that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased AGAP2 protein levels in both cell lines whilst curcumin treatment reduced ATRA-mediated AGAP2 increase. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed the presence of RARalpha, RXRalpha and the lysine acetyl transferase PCAF in AGAP2 promoter. Our results provide a novel understanding of AGAP2 expression regulation that could be beneficial to those patients with cancers where AGAP2 is overexpressed.","['Doush, Yegor', 'Surani, Arif A', 'Navarro-Corcuera, Amaia', 'McArdle, Stephanie', 'Billett, E Ellen', 'Montiel-Duarte, Cristina']","['Doush Y', 'Surani AA', 'Navarro-Corcuera A', 'McArdle S', 'Billett EE', 'Montiel-Duarte C']","['College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.', 'College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.', 'College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Navarra, 31008, Pamplona, Spain.', 'The John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.', 'College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.', 'College of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK. cristina.montielduarte@ntu.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190123,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6344547,,2019/01/25 06:00,2020/06/26 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-36888-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-36888-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jan 23;9(1):390. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-36888-x.,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9144-8809'],,,20200625,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']","['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (AGAP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted this study to explore their role in AML therapy outcomes. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of 90 AML patients, receiving chemotherapy, were analyzed by real time PCR. Gene expression was calculated by the 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method. The patients who had a persistent remission were labelled 'Good Responder' (GRes) whereas, those with relapse or drug resistance were labelled 'Poor Responders' (PRes). Higher LRP expression in bone marrow, but not in peripheral blood, was positively associated with persistent remission (p = 0.001), GRes (p = 0.002), 1-year overall as well as disease-free survival (p = 0.02 and p = 0.007, respectively). Marrow and blood MDR1 and MRP2 expression did not differ significantly between the above groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that only a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; M3) or high marrow LRP expression significantly predicted a favorable therapeutic outcome. This is the first report showing that high bone marrow LRP expression predicts significant favorable therapeutic outcome.

Validation of these candidates requires novel approaches for high-throughput in vivo perturbation of gene function. Here we develop genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer that permit rapid introduction of putative drivers by either retargeting of GEMM-derived embryonic stem cells, lentivirus-mediated somatic overexpression or in situ CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption. We use these approaches to validate Myc, Met, Pten and Rb1 as bona fide drivers in BRCA1-associated mammary tumorigenesis. Iterative mouse modeling and comparative oncogenomics analysis show that MYC-overexpression strongly reshapes the CNA landscape of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and identify MCL1 as a collaborating driver in these tumors. Moreover, MCL1 inhibition potentiates the in vivo efficacy of PARP inhibition (PARPi), underscoring the therapeutic potential of this combination for treatment of BRCA1-mutated cancer patients with poor response to PARPi monotherapy.","['Annunziato, Stefano', 'de Ruiter, Julian R', 'Henneman, Linda', 'Brambillasca, Chiara S', 'Lutz, Catrin', 'Vaillant, Francois', 'Ferrante, Federica', 'Drenth,

We previously reported that ARC regulates leukemia-microenvironment interactions through the NFkappaB/IL1beta signaling network. Malignant cells have been reported to release IL1beta, which induces PGE2 synthesis in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), in turn activating beta-catenin signaling and inducing the cancer stem cell phenotype. Although Cox-2 and its enzymatic product PGE2 play major roles in inflammation and cancer, the regulation and role of PGE2 in AML are largely unknown. Here, we report that AML-MSC cocultures greatly increase Cox-2 expression in MSC and PGE2 production in an ARC/IL1beta-dependent manner. PGE2 induced the expression of beta-catenin, which regulated ARC and augmented chemoresistance in AML cells; inhibition of beta-catenin decreased ARC and sensitized AML cells to chemotherapy. NOD/SCIDIL2RgammaNull-3/GM/SF mice transplanted with ARC-knockdown AML cells had significantly lower leukemia burden, lower serum levels of IL1beta/PGE2, and lower tissue human ARC and beta-catenin levels, prolonged survival, and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy than controls. Collectively, we present a new mechanism of action of antiapoptotic ARC by which ARC regulates PGE2 production in the tumor microenvironment and microenvironment-mediated chemoresistance in AML.Significance: The antiapoptotic protein ARC promotes AML aggressiveness by enabling detrimental cross-talk with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Po Yee', 'Wang, Xiangmeng', 'Tao, Wenjing', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Mak, Duncan', 'Mu, Hong', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak PY', 'Wang X', 'Tao W', 'Ruvolo V', 'Mak D', 'Mu H', 'Burks JK', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. mandreef@mdanderson.org bicarter@mdanderson.org.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. mandreef@mdanderson.org bicarter@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190123,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC6420856,,2019/01/25 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-18-0921 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0921 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Mar 15;79(6):1165-1177. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0921.

These are highly related to hyperleukocytosis, a major adverse risk factor with chemotherapy-based regimens. APL is a model for oncogene-targeted therapies: all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic both target and degrade its ProMyelocytic Leukemia/Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha (PML/RARA) driver. The combined ATRA/arsenic regimen now cures virtually all patients with standard-risk APL. Although FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) was an adverse risk factor for historical ATRA/chemotherapy regimens, the molecular bases for this effect remain unknown. Using mouse APL models, we unexpectedly demonstrate that FLT3-ITD severely blunts ATRA response. Remarkably, although the transcriptional output of initial ATRA response is unaffected, ATRA-induced PML/RARA degradation is blunted, as is PML nuclear body reformation and activation of P53 signaling. Critically, the combination of ATRA and arsenic fully rescues therapeutic response in FLT3-ITD APLs, restoring PML/RARA degradation, PML nuclear body reformation, P53 activation, and APL eradication.

Metabolomics technology combining mathematical model of biomarkers could be used for assisting the diagnosis of pediatric acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: The concentrations of 17 amino acids was measured by targeted liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry in periphery blood collected using dried blood spots. After evaluation, the mathematical models were further evaluated by prospective clinical validation cohort for AL diagnosis. RESULTS: The concentrations of 13 in 17 amino acids were statistically different between the periphery blood dried serum dots measured by targeted LC-MS/MS. The receiver operating characteristic analysis for the models of amino acid panel showed that the area under curve for AL diagnosis were 0.848, 0.834 and 0.856 by SVM, RF and XGBoost. The Kappa values in further prospectively evaluated clinical cohort were 0.697, 0.703 and 0.789 (p > 0.05) respectively, and the accuracies for the models were 84.86%, 85.20% and 89.46% respectively with further clinical validation. CONCLUSIONS: The established mathematical model is a faster, cheaper and more convenient way than conventional methods, and no significant difference on the effect of diagnosis comparing with conventional methods. The mathematical model can be clinically useful for assisting pediatric AL diagnosis.","['Liu, Zhidai', 'Zhou, Tingting', 'Han, Xing', 'Lang, Tingyuan', 'Liu, Shan', 'Zhang, Penghui', 'Liu, Haiyan',

Therefore, in addition to existing diagnostic and MRD detection tools, there is still a need for the development of novel approaches that can provide information on the state of the disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing genetic material reflecting the status of the parental cell, have gained interest in recent years as potential diagnostic biomarkers in cancer. Therefore, isolation and characterization of blood and bone marrow plasma-derived EVs from pediatric AML patients could be an additional approach in AML diagnostics and disease monitoring. In this study, we attempt to establish a plasma EV-RNA-based method to detect leukemia-specific FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations using established leukemia cell lines and primary pediatric AML plasma samples. We were successfully able to detect FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in the EV-RNA using GeneScan-based fragment-length analysis and real-time PCR assays, respectively, in samples before therapy. This was corresponding to the gDNA mutational analysis from leukemic blasts, and supports the potential of using EV-RNA as a diagnostic biomarker in pediatric AML.","['Kunz, Fabienne', 'Kontopoulou, Evangelia', 'Reinhardt, Katarina', 'Soldierer, Maren', 'Strachan, Sarah', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Thakur, Basant Kumar']","['Kunz F', 'Kontopoulou E', 'Reinhardt K', 'Soldierer M', 'Strachan S', 'Reinhardt D', 'Thakur BK']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45147, Essen, Germany.

Patients with disease- or therapy-related immunodeficiency are especially at risk for fatal infections caused by MDRO. The impact of MDRO colonization on the clinical course of AML patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy-a potentially curative but highly toxic treatment option-has not been systematically studied. MATERIALS & METHODS: 312 AML patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy between 2007 and 2015 were examined for MDRO colonization. Patients with evidence for MDRO before or during the hospital stay of induction chemotherapy were defined as colonized, patients who never had a positive swab for MDRO were defined as noncolonized. RESULTS: Of 312 AML patients 90 were colonized and 130 were noncolonized. Colonized patients suffered from significantly more days with fever, spent more days on the intensive care unit and had a higher median C-reactive protein value during the hospital stay. These findings did not result in a prolonged length of hospital stay or an increased mortality rate for colonized patients. However, in a subgroup analysis, patients colonized with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) had a significantly reduced 60- and 90-day, as well as 1- and 2-year survival rates when compared to noncolonized patients. CONCLUSION: Our analysis highlights the importance of intensive MDRO screening especially in patients with febrile neutropenia since persisting fever can be a sign of MDRO-colonization. CRE-colonized patients require special surveillance, since they seem to be at risk for death.","['Ballo, Olivier', 'Tarazzit, Ikram', 'Stratmann, Jan', 'Reinheimer, Claudia', 'Hogardt, Michael', 'Wichelhaus, Thomas A', 'Kempf, Volkhard', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Finkelmeier, Fabian', 'Brandts, Christian']","['Ballo O', 'Tarazzit I', 'Stratmann J', 'Reinheimer C', 'Hogardt M', 'Wichelhaus TA', 'Kempf V', 'Serve H', 'Finkelmeier F', 'Brandts C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT), Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT), Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT), Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT), Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190123,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6343922,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/01/24 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0210991 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-28049 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jan 23;14(1):e0210991. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0210991. eCollection 2019.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1634-1988', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7726-6622']",,,20191101,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/isolation & purification', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/isolation & purification', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the impact of clinical trial accrual on response rates, early mortality and survival in patients with AML enrolled between 2002 and 2009 into two parallel cooperative group clinical trials SWOG S0106/ECOG-ACRIN E1900. Institutions were classified as low- (LAIs) (</= 9 enrolled patients) or high-accruing institutions (HAIs) (>/=10 enrolled patients). Fisher's exact text and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the response and early mortality rates. The effect of accrual volume on survival was analyzed by log-rank tests and Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1252 patients from 152 institutions were included in the final analyses. The median clinical trial registrations in HAIs was 19 patients (range, 10 to 92) versus 3 (range, 1 to 9) patients in LAIs. In multivariate analyses, HAIs, as a quantitative covariate, was associated with improved complete remission rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.08, p = 0.0051), but no improvement median overall survival (HR 0.97, p = 0.065) or median event-free (hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, p = 0.05). Early mortality rates were similar between cohorts and academic affiliation had no impact on response rates or survival.

Analyses of 38 AML samples through integrated transcriptional and chromatin mark analysis exposes 2 major subtypes. One subtype is dominated by patients with NPM1 mutations or MLL-fusion genes, shows activation of the regulatory pathways involving HOX-family genes as targets, and displays high self-renewal capacity and stemness. The second subtype is enriched for RUNX1 or spliceosome mutations, suggesting potential interplay between the 2 aberrations, and mainly depends on IRF family regulators. Cellular consequences in prognosis predict a relatively worse outcome for the first subtype.

Patient was referred to hematology, where he was diagnosed as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and started on imatinib mesylate. Thereafter, he presented with recurrence of neovascularization and vascularization of the bleb along with OS vitreous hemorrhage at 6 weeks follow-up. While he was planned for OS vitreo-retinal surgery, he presented with OD spontaneous hyphema with raised IOP (OD: 38 mmHg, OS: 16 mmHg). He had maintained a tight glycemic control. Following imatinib therapy, there was a rapid progression and recurrence of neovascularization, eventually leading to failure of trabeculectomy OD and bilateral severe loss of vision. Imatinib may be implicated in the worsening of NVG in CML patients, especially with co-existing diabetes and thus, such patients should receive regular thorough ophthalmic evaluation as long as imatinib continues.","['Roop, Prakhyat', 'Angmo, Dewang', 'Kamble, Neha', 'Tomar, Ankit S']","['Roop P', 'Angmo D', 'Kamble N', 'Tomar AS']","['Glaucoma Research and Clinical Facility, Department of Ophthalmology, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Glaucoma Research and Clinical Facility, Department of Ophthalmology, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Glaucoma Research and Clinical Facility, Department of Ophthalmology, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Glaucoma Research and Clinical Facility, Department of Ophthalmology, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,India,Indian J Ophthalmol,Indian journal of ophthalmology,0405376,PMC6376821,['None'],2019/01/24 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJOphthalmol_2019_67_2_285_250660 [pii]', '10.4103/ijo.IJO_1288_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Ophthalmol. 2019 Feb;67(2):285-287. doi: 10.4103/ijo.IJO_1288_18.,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'neovascular glaucoma']",,,,,,20190610,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Glaucoma, Neovascular/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Gonioscopy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Trabeculectomy', '*Visual Acuity']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we revealed that the ZBTB16 locus encoding PLZF, is repressed by Polycomb (PcG) and H3K27me3 in naive hMSCs. At the pre-osteoblast stage of differentiation, the locus lost PcG binding and H3K27me3, gained JMJD3 recruitment, and H3K27ac resulting in high expression of PLZF. Subsequently, PLZF was recruited to osteogenic enhancers, influencing H3K27 acetylation and expression of nearby genes important for osteogenic function. Furthermore, we identified a latent enhancer within the ZBTB16/PLZF locus itself that became active, gained PLZF, p300 and Mediator binding and looped to the promoter of the nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) gene. The increased expression of NNMT correlated with a decline in SAM levels, which is dependent on PLZF and is required for osteogenic differentiation.","['Agrawal Singh, Shuchi', 'Lerdrup, Mads',

However, the toxicity of this regimen is high, with disappointing clinical outcomes among the so-called poor-prognosis AML subsets, which generally refer to patients with adverse cytogenetic risk, secondary AML including therapy-related AML, poor-prognosis mutations, especially FLT3-ITD, and relapse/refractory AML. Areas covered: To the best of our knowledge, the role and efficacy of 7 + 3 schedules containing daunorubicin (DNR) and Ara-C for certain types of poor-prognosis AML has not been systematically assessed. A critical approach to the role of DNR and Ara-C induction could be relevant to establish which patients should be enrolled in clinical trials using novel therapies. Expert commentary: In this regard, a recent randomized clinical trial (RCT) showed improved results in older patients with sAML or high-risk cytogenetics who received CPX-351 compared with standard 7 + 3 combination. We perform a systematic literature review to analyze the clinical outcomes reported with DNR plus Ara-C regimens in adult patients with poor-prognosis AML, the use of liposomal formulations of DNR and Ara-C and the RCTs which compared standard 7 + 3 with the addition of a third drug.","['Megias-Vericat, Juan Eduardo', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Poveda, Jose Luis', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Sanz MA', 'Poveda JL', 'Montesinos P']","['a Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'b Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'c CIBERONC , Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'b Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'c CIBERONC , Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'a Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'b Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia , Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe , Valencia , Spain.', 'c CIBERONC , Instituto Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20190206,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,,,2019/01/24 06:00,2019/02/28 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2019.1573668 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Mar;12(3):197-218. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2019.1573668.

However, the anti-cancer effect of JS-K in gastric cancer has not been reported. In this study, we found that JS-K inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and triggered mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, JS-K induced a significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the clearance of ROS by antioxidant reagents reversed JS-K-induced toxicity in gastric cancer cells and subcutaneous xenografts. Although JS-K triggered significant NO release, NO scavenging had no effect on JS-K-induced toxicity in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, ROS, but not NO, mediated the anti-cancer effects of JS-K in gastric cancer. We also explored the potential mechanism of JS-K-induced ROS accumulation and found that JS-K significantly down-regulated the core proteins of mitochondria respiratory chain (MRC) complex I and IV, resulting in the reduction of MRC complex I and IV activity and the subsequent ROS production. Moreover, JS-K inhibited the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including copper-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and catalase, which contributed to the decrease of antioxidant enzymes activity and the subsequent inhibition of ROS clearance. Therefore, JS-K may target MRC complex I and IV and antioxidant enzymes to exert ROS-dependent anti-cancer function, leading to the potential usage of JS-K in the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer.","['Zhao, Xudong', 'Cai, Aizhen', 'Peng, Zheng', 'Liang, Wenquan', 'Xi, Hongqing', 'Li, Peiyu', 'Chen, Guozhu', 'Yu, Jiyun', 'Chen, Lin']","['Zhao X', 'Cai A', 'Peng Z', 'Liang W', 'Xi H', 'Li P', 'Chen G', 'Yu J', 'Chen L']","[""Department of General Surgery, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Institute of Military Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Military Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Department of General Surgery, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC6433691,,2019/01/24 06:00,2020/07/11 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2019 Apr;23(4):2489-2504. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14122.

It continues to be evaluated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) at lower doses due to dose-related toxicities including tumour flare and tumour lysis syndrome. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for lenalidomide in multiple cancers, including CLL, to identify any disease-related differences in disposition. METHODS: Lenalidomide concentrations from 4 clinical trials were collated (1999 samples, 125 subjects), covering 4 cancers (multiple myeloma, CLL, acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and a large dose range (2.5-75 mg). A population pharmacokinetic model was developed with NONMEM and patient demographics were tested as covariates. RESULTS: The data were best fitted by a 1-compartment kinetic model with absorption described by 7 transit compartments. Clearance and volume of distribution were allometrically scaled for fat-free mass. The population parameter estimates for apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution and transit rate constant were 12 L/h (10.8-13.6), 68.8 L (61.8-76.3), and 13.5 h(-1) (11.9-36.8) respectively. Patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) exhibited a 22% reduction in lenalidomide clearance compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min. Cancer type had no discernible effect on lenalidomide disposition. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a lenalidomide population pharmacokinetic model to evaluate lenalidomide pharmacokinetics in patients with CLL and compare its pharmacokinetics with other B-cell malignancies. As no differences in pharmacokinetics were found between the observed cancer-types, the unique toxicities observed in CLL may be due to disease-specific pharmacodynamics.","['Hughes, Jim H', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Upton, Richard N', 'Reuter, Stephanie E', 'Gao, Yue', 'Byrd, John C', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Hofmeister, Craig C', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Blum, William', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Foster, David J R']","['Hughes JH', 'Phelps MA', 'Upton RN', 'Reuter SE', 'Gao Y', 'Byrd JC', 'Grever MR', 'Hofmeister CC', 'Marcucci G', 'Blum W', 'Blum KA', 'Foster DJR']","['Australian Centre for Pharmacometrics, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Australia.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Australian Centre for Pharmacometrics, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Australia.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Australian Centre for Pharmacometrics, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190227,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,PMC6475687,,2019/01/24 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.13873 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 May;85(5):924-934. doi: 10.1111/bcp.13873.

Thus, a sensitive and accurate method for monitoring the corresponding surface markers is in high demand for early diagnosis and treatment instruction. Herein, we developed a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based sandwich-type immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of two surface markers (i.e., CD19 and CD20) in Raji cell lines as well as in clinical blood samples. First, to compare with the results obtained by flow cytometry, we evaluated the sensitivity and reproducibility of the SERS immunoassay for real-time detection of CD19 and CD20 expressions in Raji cells and blood samples. Then, we conducted follow-up tests on 13 B cell hematological malignancy patients for one month and dynamically monitored their CD19 and CD20 expressions by the SERS immunoassay. In addition to the improved sensitivity of the SERS method, good linear correlations between the SERS intensities and flow cytometry results were also observed for both CD19 and CD20, which indicated the accuracy of this SERS-based strategy. Therefore, this SERS-based simultaneous detection approach shows great potential for accurate and early diagnosis of MRD in B cell hematological malignancies.","['Wang, Yujie', 'Zong, Shenfei', 'Li, Na', 'Wang, Zhuyuan', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Cui, Yiping']","['Wang Y', 'Zong S', 'Li N', 'Wang Z', 'Chen B', 'Cui Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China. cba8888@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,,,2019/01/24 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8nr06929h [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2019 Jan 31;11(5):2460-2467. doi: 10.1039/c8nr06929h.,,,,,,,,20190306,IM,"['Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/blood', 'Limit of Detection', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnostic imaging', 'Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/*methods']","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Cell viability and colony formation assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of imatinib, GNF5 and GNF2 on the growth of SK-HEP1 cells. Using immunoblot analysis, we assessed change of the activation of caspases, PARP, Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and Skp2/p27/p21 pathway by imatinib and GNF5 in SK-HEP1 cells. Using sh-Skp2 HCC cells, the role of Skp2 in the effects of imatinib and GNF5 was evaluated. Results: Imatinib and GNF5 significantly inhibited the growth of SK-HEP1 cells. Treatment of imatinib and GNF5 decreased Skp2 expression and Akt phosphorylation, and increased the expression of p27, p21, and active-caspases in SK-HEP1 cells. In sh-Skp2 HCC cells, cell growth and the expression of Skp2 were inhibited by more than in the mock group treated with imatinib and GNF5. Conclusions: These results suggest that the anti-growth activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be associated with the regulation of p27/p21 and caspases through Skp2 blockage in HCC cells.","['Kim, Sung Hyun', 'Kim, Myoung-Ok', 'Kim, Ki-Rim']","['Kim SH', 'Kim MO', 'Kim KR']","['China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Henan, China.', 'Department of Animal Science, College of Ecology and Environment Science, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Korea.', 'Department of Dental Hygiene, College of Science and Technology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181230,Korea (South),J Cancer Prev,Journal of cancer prevention,101615965,PMC6330986,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.'],2019/01/24 06:00,2019/01/24 06:01,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.15430/JCP.2018.23.4.170 [doi]', 'jcp-23-170 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Prev. 2018 Dec;23(4):170-175. doi: 10.15430/JCP.2018.23.4.170.

In the bone marrow, the process of how HSCs exert self-renewal and differentiation is tightly regulated by the surrounding microenvironment, or niche. Recent advances in imaging technologies and numerous knockout or knockin mouse models have greatly improved our understanding of the organization of the bone marrow niche. This niche compartment includes a complex network of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), osteolineage cells, endothelial cells (arterioles and sinusoids), sympathetic nerves, nonmyelinating Schwann cells and megakaryocytes. In addition, different types of mediators, such as cytokines/chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exosomes play a pivotal role in regulating the function of hematopoietic cells. Therefore, the niche components and the hematopoietic system make up an ecological environment that maintains the homeostasis and responds to stress, damage or disease conditions. On the other hand, the niche compartment can become a traitor that can do harm to normal hematopoietic cells under pathological conditions. Studies on the diseased bone marrow niche have only recently begun to appear in the extant literature.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of all immunocompromised cancer patients diagnosed with proven or probable IA between February 2012 and March 2018. This trial included 26 patients from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, 20 patients from Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil, and 10 patients from St. Luke's International Hospital Tokyo, Japan. Results: A total of 56 patients were analyzed. They were divided into 2 groups voriconazole containing regimen and non-voriconazole containing regimen (90% Amphotericin B based regimen). Both groups had similar characteristic, age, gender, and immunocompromised status. The majority of patients had underlying leukemia (63%), followed by lymphoma (20%), myeloma (16%) and other hematologic malignancy (1%). Antifungal primary therapy with voriconazole-containing regimen was associated with better response to treatment (p = 0.003). Survival analysis showed that primary therapy with a voriconazole containing regimen was significantly associated with improved survival (p =0.006). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, mechanical ventilation was a predictor of worse outcomes (poor response to therapy and increased mortality within 6 months), whereas primary treatment with voriconazole containing regimen was associated with improved outcomes including response to primary therapy (OR=18.1, p=0.002) and 6-month mortality (OR=0.14, p=0.011). Conclusions: Based on international experience in immunocompromised cancer patients with IA, primary therapy with voriconazole-containing regimen is associated with improved response and survival compared with non-voriconazole amphotericin B based regimen.","['Hachem, Ray', 'Batista, Marjorie V', 'Kanj, Souha S', 'El Zein, Saeed', 'Haddad, Sara', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Mori, Nobuyoshi', 'Vanderson, Rocha', 'Chaftari, Anne-Marie', 'Raad, Issam']","['Hachem R', 'Batista MV', 'Kanj SS', 'El Zein S', 'Haddad S', 'Jiang Y', 'Mori N', 'Vanderson R', 'Chaftari AM', 'Raad I']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control and Employee Health, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190101,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,PMC6328033,['Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/01/24 06:00,2019/01/24 06:01,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2019.003 [doi]', 'mjhid-11-1-e2019003 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2019 Jan 1;11(1):e2019003. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2019.003. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunocompromised', 'Invasive aspergillosis', 'Voriconazole']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The homogeneity between KWM/Hym and the inbred strains was as follows: C57BL/6J (39.3%), BALB/c AJic (42.9%), and DBA/2J (50%). KWM/Hym is most similar to the PWK/PhJ inbred strain (96.4%) derived from wild mice (Czech Republic). To identify the morphometric characteristics of KWM/Hym, the external morphology was measured. The tail ratio of male and female was 79.60+/-3.09 and 73.55+/-6.14%, respectively. KWM/Hym has short and agouti-colored hairs and its belly is white with golden hair. Taking these results together, KWM/Hym, a newly developing inbred mouse originated from wild mouse, might be use as new genetic resources to overcome the limitations of the current laboratory mice.","['Nam, Hajin', 'Kim, Yoo Yeon', 'Kim, Boyoung', 'Yoon, Won Kee', 'Kim, Hyoung-Chin', 'Suh, Jun Gyo']","['Nam H', 'Kim YY', 'Kim B', 'Yoon WK', 'Kim HC', 'Suh JG']","['Department of Medical Genetics, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Laboratory Animal Resource Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Cheongju, Korea.', 'Laboratory Animal Resource Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Cheongju, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181231,England,Lab Anim Res,Laboratory animal research,101560684,PMC6333606,"['Conflict of interests: The authors declare that there is no financial conflict of', 'interests to publish these results.']",2019/01/24 06:00,2019/01/24 06:01,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5625/lar.2018.34.4.311 [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Anim Res. 2018 Dec;34(4):311-316. doi: 10.5625/lar.2018.34.4.311.

Here, we investigated the state of ophthalmic medical care for ATL and ATL-related ocular manifestations by conducting the first large-scale nationwide survey in Japan. A total of 115 facilities were surveyed, including all university hospitals in Japan that were members of the Japanese Ophthalmological Society and regional core facilities that were members of the Japanese Ocular Inflammation Society. The collected nationwide data on the state of medical care for ATL-related ocular manifestations and ATL-associated ocular findings were categorized, tallied, and analyzed. Of the 115 facilities, 69 (60%) responded. Overall, 28 facilities (43.0%) had experience in providing ophthalmic care to ATL patients. ATL-related ocular manifestations were most commonly diagnosed ""based on blood tests and characteristic ophthalmic findings."" By analyzing the 48 reported cases of ATL-related ocular manifestations, common ATL-related ocular lesions were intraocular infiltration (22 cases, 45.8%) and opportunistic infections (19 cases, 39.6%). All cases of opportunistic infection were cytomegalovirus retinitis. Dry eye (3 cases, 6.3%), scleritis (2 cases, 4.2%), uveitis (1 case, 2.1%), and anemic retinopathy (1 case, 2.1%) were also seen. In conclusion, intraocular infiltration and cytomegalovirus retinitis are common among ATL patients, and ophthalmologists should keep these findings in mind in their practice.","['Kamoi, Koju', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Izumo, Shuji', 'Hamaguchi, Isao', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko']","['Kamoi K', 'Okayama A', 'Izumo S', 'Hamaguchi I', 'Uchimaru K', 'Tojo A', 'Ohno-Matsui K']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190108,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC6331419,,2019/01/24 06:00,2019/01/24 06:01,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.03240 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Jan 8;9:3240. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.03240. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', 'intraocular infiltration', 'nationwide survey', 'ocular manifestations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaplan-Meier survival and hazard ratios for mortality were calculated for factors known at time of relapse using Cox proportional hazards models. The median (range) age at time of first HCT was 10.9 (0.5-20.9) years, time to relapse was 6.1 (0.2-89.5) months after HCT, and age at relapse was 11.7 (0.7-23.6) years. The 3-year overall survival (OS) after relapse was 13% (95% confidence interval (CI): 9%, 18%).The median (range) follow-up for the 18 surviving patients was 7.2 (3.0-24.4) years after relapse. The remaining 214 died after a median of 3 months (0.02-190.4). OS was not significantly different for patients with ALL as compared to AML. Fifty-one patients proceeded to second transplant of whom nine survive. Factors associated with improved survival included late relapse (>12 months), ALL in first CR at the time of first transplant and chemotherapy-based first conditioning regimens. These results can be used to counsel patients at the time of relapse after first transplant and as a baseline for comparison as to the effectiveness of newer therapies which are greatly needed for treatment of post-transplant relapse.","['Dahlberg, Ann', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Bleakley, Marie', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Summers, Corinne', 'Hadland, Brandon', 'Delaney, Colleen', 'Mallhi, Kanwaldeep', 'Burroughs, Lauri', 'Carpenter, Paul', 'Woolfrey, Ann']","['Dahlberg A', 'Leisenring W', 'Bleakley M', 'Meshinchi S', 'Baker KS', 'Summers C', 'Hadland B', 'Delaney C', 'Mallhi K', 'Burroughs L', 'Carpenter P', 'Woolfrey A']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. adahlber@fredhutch.org.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,PMC6646113,,2019/01/24 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-019-0438-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-019-0438-z [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Aug;54(8):1337-1345. doi: 10.1038/s41409-019-0438-z.

A screening method optimized to discover cytotoxic compounds selective for MLL-rearranged leukemia identified CCI-006 as a novel inhibitor of MLL-rearranged and CALM-AF10 translocated leukemias that share common leukemogenic pathways. CCI-006 inhibited mitochondrial respiration and induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis in a subset (7/11, 64%) of MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines within a few hours of treatment. The unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cells did not undergo mitochondrial membrane depolarization or apoptosis despite a similar attenuation of mitochondrial respiration by the compound. In comparison to the sensitive cells, the unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cells were characterized by a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype, exemplified by a more pronounced sensitivity to glycolysis inhibitors and elevated HIF1alpha expression. Silencing of HIF1alpha expression sensitized an intrinsically unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cell to CCI-006, indicating that this pathway plays a role in determining sensitivity to the compound. In addition, unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cells expressed increased levels of MEIS1, an important leukemogenic MLL target gene that plays a role in regulating metabolic phenotype through HIF1alpha. MEIS1 expression was also variable in a pediatric MLL-rearranged ALL patient dataset, highlighting the existence of a previously undescribed metabolic variability in MLL-rearranged leukemia that may contribute to the heterogeneity of the disease. This study thus identified a novel small molecule that rapidly kills MLL-rearranged leukemia cells by targeting a metabolic vulnerability in a subset of low HIF1alpha/low MEIS1-expressing MLL-rearranged leukemia cells.","['Somers, Klaartje', 'Wen, Victoria W', 'Middlemiss, Shiloh M C', 'Osborne, Brenna', 'Forgham, Helen', 'Jung, MoonSun', 'Karsa, Mawar', 'Clifton, Molly', 'Bongers,

Treatment advances have provided 5-year survival rates ranging from 78 to 91% depending on the age at diagnosis. However, approximately 2-3% of patients will present with refractory disease that is unresponsive to chemotherapy, and 10-15% of patients will relapse. Outcomes post-relapse show significantly reduced 5-year survival rates that continue to decrease with each subsequent relapse. Despite our increased understanding of risk factors and disease predictors, treatment strategies for patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease, including variations of chemotherapy and stem cell transplant, remain ineffective for many patients. To improve outcomes of patients with r/r disease, immunotherapies targeting specific B cell antigens are being developed. Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with refractory leukemia or those with second or later relapse.

Interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and the nuclear domain 10-associated proteins, such as promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, localize to input viral genomes, but they are also capable of restricting progeny viral transcription. In this study, we used structured illumination microscopy to show that after HSV DNA replication, IFI16 forms nuclear filamentous structures on DNA within a subset of nuclear replication compartments in HSV-1 ICP0-null mutant virus-infected human cells. The ability to form filaments in different cell types correlates with the efficiency of restriction, and the kinetics of filament formation and epigenetic changes are similar. Thus, both are consistent with the filamentous structures being involved in epigenetic silencing of viral progeny DNA. IFI16 filaments recruit other restriction factors, including PML, Sp100, and ATRX, to aid in the restriction. Although the filaments are only in a subset of the replication compartments, IFI16 reduces the levels of elongation-competent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in all replication compartments. Therefore, we propose that IFI16 filaments with associated restriction factors that form in replication compartments constitute a ""restrictosome"" structure that signals in cis and trans to silence the progeny viral DNA throughout the infected cell nucleus. The IFI16 filamentous structure may constitute the first known nuclear supramolecular organizing center for signaling in the cell nucleus.IMPORTANCE Mammalian cells exhibit numerous strategies to recognize and contain viral infections. The best-characterized antiviral responses are those that are induced within the cytosol by receptors that activate interferon responses or shut down translation. Antiviral responses also occur in the nucleus, yet these intranuclear innate immune responses are poorly defined at the receptor-proximal level. In this study, we explored the ability of cells to restrict infection by assembling viral DNA into transcriptionally silent heterochromatin within the nucleus. We found that the IFI16 restriction factor forms filaments on DNA within infected cells. These filaments recruit antiviral restriction factors to prevent viral replication in various cell types. Mechanistically, IFI16 filaments inhibit the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to viral genes. We propose that IFI16 filaments with associated restriction factors constitute a ""restrictosome"" structure that can signal to other parts of the nucleus where foreign DNA is located that it should be silenced.","['Merkl, Philipp E', 'Knipe, David M']","['Merkl PE', 'Knipe DM']","['Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA david_knipe@hms.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,PMC6343039,,2019/01/24 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.02621-18 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.02621-18 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2019 Jan 22;10(1). pii: mBio.02621-18. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02621-18.,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA virus', '*chromatin', '*epigenetics', '*signaling', '*supramolecular organizing center']",['R01 AI106934/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1554-6236'],,,20190405,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Silencing', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', '*Protein Multimerization', '*Virus Replication']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '148998-64-5 (IFI16 protein, human)']",,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Merkl and Knipe.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The infection of APCs by viruses often induces their dysfunction, and it has been shown that FV infection reduces the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to prime critical CD8(+) T cell responses. Nonetheless, mice mount vigorous CD8(+) T cell responses, so we investigated whether B cells might serve as alternative APCs during FV infection. Direct ex vivo analysis of B cells from FV-infected mice revealed that infected but not uninfected B cells upregulated expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40, as well as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that, compared to uninfected B cells from the same mice, the FV-infected B cells had significantly enhanced APC function, as measured by their capacity to prime CD8(+) T cell activation and proliferation. Thus, in contrast to DCs, infection of B cells with FV enhanced their APC capacity and ability to stimulate the CD8(+) T cell responses essential for virus control. FV infections also induce the activation and expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), so it was of interest to determine the impact of Tregs on B cell activation. The upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression and APC function of B cells was even more strongly enhanced by in vivo depletion of regulatory T cells than infection. Thus, Tregs exert potent homeostatic suppression of B cell activation that is partially overcome by FV infection.IMPORTANCE The primary role of B cells in immunity is considered the production of pathogen-specific antibodies, but another, less-well-studied, function of B cells is to present foreign antigens to T cells to stimulate their activation and proliferation. Dendritic cells (DCs) are considered the most important antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for CD8(+) T cells, but DCs lose APC function when infected with Friend virus (FV), a model retrovirus of mice. Interestingly, B cells were better able to stimulate CD8(+) T cell responses when they were infected with FV. We also found that the activation status of B cells under homeostatic conditions was potently modulated by regulatory T cells. This study illustrates an important link between B cell and T cell responses and illustrates an additional mechanism by which regulatory T cells suppress critical T cell responses during viral infections.","['Moore, Tyler C', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Gonzaga, Lorena M', 'Mather, Jennifer M', 'Carmody, Aaron B', 'Bayer, Wibke', 'Littwitz-Salomon, Elisabeth', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J']","['Moore TC', 'Messer RJ', 'Gonzaga LM', 'Mather JM', 'Carmody AB', 'Bayer W', 'Littwitz-Salomon E', 'Dittmer U', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Research Technologies Branch, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, USA khasenkrug@nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,PMC6343038,,2019/01/24 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.02578-18 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.02578-18 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2019 Jan 22;10(1). pii: mBio.02578-18. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02578-18.,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell responses', '*CD8+ T cells', '*antigen presentation', '*regulatory T cells', '*retroviruses']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5885-5592', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8523-4911']",,,20190405,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'B7-2 Antigen/analysis', 'CD40 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/virology']","['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is classified as an overlap myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic neoplasm by the World Health Organization and shares some features with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in adults. JMML pathobiology is characterized by constitutive activation of the Ras signal transduction pathway. About 90% of patients harbor molecular alterations in 1 of 5 genes (PTPN11, NRAS, KRAS, NF1, or CBL), which define genetically and clinically distinct subtypes. Three of these subtypes, PTPN11-, NRAS-, and KRAS-mutated JMML, are characterized by heterozygous somatic gain-of-function mutations in nonsyndromic children, whereas 2 subtypes, JMML in neurofibromatosis type 1 and JMML in children with CBL syndrome, are defined by germline Ras disease and acquired biallelic inactivation of the respective genes in hematopoietic cells. The clinical course of the disease varies widely and can in part be predicted by age, level of hemoglobin F, and platelet count. The majority of children require allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for long-term leukemia-free survival, but the disease will eventually resolve spontaneously in approximately 15% of patients, rendering the prospective identification of these cases a clinical necessity. Most recently, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles identified distinct methylation signatures correlating with clinical and genetic features and highly predictive for outcome.

The diagnostic boundaries between these diseases can be arbitrary and not necessarily reflective of underlying disease biology or outcomes. In practice, measures that distinguish MDS from related disorders may be difficult to quantify and can vary as disease progression occurs. Patients may harbor findings that are not consistent with a single diagnostic category. Several overlap disorders have been formally described, such as the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs). These disorders are characterized by hematopoietic dysplasia with increased proliferation of monocytes, neutrophils, or platelets. They may have mutational profiles that distinguish them from the disorders they resemble and reflect important differences in pathophysiology. MDS also shares diagnostic borders with other diseases. For example, aplastic anemia and hypoplastic MDS can be difficult to distinguish in patients with pancytopenia and bone marrow hypocellularity. Genetic features may help in this regard, because they can identify differences in prognosis and risk of progression. The boundary between MDS and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) is arbitrarily defined and has been redefined over the years. Genetic studies have demonstrated that sAML clones can precede clinical progression from MDS by many months, suggesting that MDS with excess blasts could be viewed as an overlap between a dysplastic bone marrow failure syndrome and an oligoblastic leukemia. This review will describe the diagnostic boundaries between MDS, MDS/MPNs, sAML, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance, and aplastic anemia and how genetic approaches may help to better define them.","['Tanaka, Tiffany N', 'Bejar, Rafael']","['Tanaka TN', 'Bejar R']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190122,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,2019/01/24 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42727-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-10-844670 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Mar 7;133(10):1086-1095. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-10-844670.

Through intensive efforts of sequencing of a large number of MDS genomes, a comprehensive registry of driver mutations recurrently found in a recognizable fraction of MDS patients has been revealed, and ongoing efforts are being made to clarify their impacts on clinical phenotype and prognosis, as well as their role in the pathogenesis of MDS. Among major mutational targets in MDS are the molecules involved in DNA methylations, chromatin modification, RNA splicing, transcription, signal transduction, cohesin regulation, and DNA repair. Showing substantial overlaps with driver mutations seen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as age-related clonal hematopoiesis in healthy individuals, these mutations are presumed to have a common clonal origin. Mutations are thought to be acquired and positively selected in a well-organized manner to allow for expansion of the initiating clone to compromise normal hematopoiesis, ultimately giving rise to MDS and subsequent transformation to AML in many patients. Significant correlations between mutations suggest the presence of functional interactions between mutations, which dictate disease progression. Mutations are frequently associated with specific disease phenotype, drug response, and clinical outcomes, and thus, it is essential to be familiar with MDS genetics for better management of patients.

Here, we demonstrate that (R)-TEMOSPho enhances megakaryopoiesis and plateletogenesis from primary hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) induced by thrombopoietin (TPO). Specifically, we demonstrate at sub-saturation levels of TPO, the addition of (R)-TEMOSPho enhances differentiation and maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs) from murine HSCs derived from fetal liver. Furthermore, we show that production of platelets with (R)-TEMOSPho in combination with TPO is also more efficient than TPO alone and that platelets generated in vitro with these two agents are as functional as those from TPO alone. TPO can thus be partly replaced by or supplemented with (R)-TEMOSPho, and this in turn implies that (R)-TEMOSPho can be useful in efficient platelet production in vitro and potentially be a valuable option in designing cell-based therapy.

Adoptive cellular therapies using chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have achieved remarkable clinical responses in B cell leukemia and lymphoma but the effect on solid tumors including lung cancer is limited. Here we present data on the therapeutic potential of allogeneic CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) double negative T (DNT) cells as a new cellular therapy for the treatment of lung cancer and underlying mechanisms. METHODS: DNTs were enriched and expanded ex vivo from healthy donors and phenotyped by flow cytometry. Functionally, their cytotoxicity was determined against primary and established non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in vitro or through in vivo adoptive transfer into xenograft models. Mechanistic analysis was performed using blocking antibodies against various cell surface and soluble markers. Furthermore, the role of IL-15 on DNT function was determined. RESULTS: We demonstrated that ex vivo expanded DNTs can effectively lyse various human NSCLC cells in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models. Expanded DNTs have a cytotoxic phenotype, as they express NKp30, NKG2D, DNAM-1, membrane TRAIL (mTRAIL), perforin and granzyme B, and secrete IFNgamma and soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL). DNT-mediated cytotoxicity was dependent on a combination of tumor-expressed ligands for NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp30 and/or receptors for TRAIL, which differ among different NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, stimulation of DNTs with IL-15 increased expression of effector molecules on DNTs, their TRAIL production and cytotoxicity against NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Healthy donor-derived DNTs can target NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. DNTs recognize tumors via innate receptors which can be up-regulated by IL-15. DNTs have the potential to be used as a novel adoptive cell therapy for lung cancer either alone or in combination with IL-15.","['Yao, Junlin', 'Ly, Dalam', 'Dervovic, Dzana', 'Fang, Linan', 'Lee, Jong Bok', 'Kang, Hyeonjeong', 'Wang, Yu-Hui', 'Pham, Nhu-An', 'Pan, Hongming', 'Tsao, Ming-Sound', 'Zhang, Li']","['Yao J', 'Ly D', 'Dervovic D', 'Fang L', 'Lee JB', 'Kang H', 'Wang YH', 'Pham NA', 'Pan H', 'Tsao MS', 'Zhang L']","['Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Present address: Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Present address: Department of Systems Biology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.', 'University Health Network, Princess Margaret Cancer Research Tower, 101 College St. Rm 2-807, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada. lzhang@uhnresearch.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,PMC6343266,,2019/01/24 06:00,2020/04/02 06:00,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-019-0507-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-019-0507-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2019 Jan 22;7(1):17. doi: 10.1186/s40425-019-0507-2.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adoptive cellular therapy', '*Double negative T cells', '*IL-15', '*Lung cancer']",['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,20200401,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ligands', 'Lung Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation']","['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Ligands)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before the identification of genetic driver lesions, chemically, irradiation or viral infection-induced mouse leukaemia models provided platforms to test novel chemotherapeutics. Later, transgenic mouse models were established to test the in vivo transforming potential of newly cloned fusion genes and genetic aberrations detected in patients' genomes. Hereby researchers constitutively or conditionally expressed the respective gene in the germline of the mouse or reconstituted the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice with bone marrow virally expressing the mutation of interest. More recently, immune deficient mice have been explored to study patient-derived human AML cells in vivo. Unfortunately, although complementary to each other, none of the currently available strategies faithfully model the initiation and progression of the human disease. Nevertheless, fast advances in the fields of next generation sequencing, molecular technology and bioengineering are continuously contributing to the generation of better mouse models. Here we review the most important AML mouse models of each category, briefly describe their advantages and limitations and show how they have contributed to our understanding of the biology and to the development of novel therapies.","['Almosailleakh, Marwa', 'Schwaller, Juerg']","['Almosailleakh M', 'Schwaller J']","[""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital beider Basel (UKBB), University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland. m.almosailleakh@unibas.ch."", ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital beider Basel (UKBB), University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.

Chromosomal translocations involving the NUP214 locus are recurrent in acute leukemia and frequently fuse the C-terminal region of NUP214 with SET and DEK, two chromatin remodeling proteins with roles in transcription regulation. SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 fusion proteins disrupt protein nuclear export by inhibition of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, which results in the aberrant accumulation of CRM1 protein cargoes in the nucleus. SET-NUP214 is primarily associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas DEK-NUP214 exclusively results in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), indicating different leukemogenic driver mechanisms. Secondary mutations in leukemic blasts may contribute to the different leukemia outcomes. Additional layers of complexity arise from the respective functions of SET and DEK in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling, which may drive malignant hematopoietic transformation more towards ALL or AML. Another, less frequent fusion protein involving the C terminus of NUP214 results in the sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1)-NUP214 chimera, which was detected in ALL. SQSTM1 is a ubiquitin-binding protein required for proper autophagy induction, linking the NUP214 fusion protein to yet another cellular mechanism. The scope of this review is to summarize the general features of NUP214-related leukemia and discuss how distinct chromosomal translocation partners can influence the cellular effects of NUP214 fusion proteins in leukemia.","['Mendes, Adelia', 'Fahrenkrog, Birthe']","['Mendes A', 'Fahrenkrog B']","['Institute of Biology and Molecular Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium. mrodrig6@ulb.ac.be.', 'Institute of Biology and Molecular Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium. bfahrenk@ulb.ac.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190121,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,PMC6356203,,2019/01/24 06:00,2019/01/24 06:01,['2019/01/24 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cells8010076 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8010076 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Jan 21;8(1). pii: cells8010076. doi: 10.3390/cells8010076.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRM1', '*DEK', '*HOX genes', '*NUP214', '*SET', '*chromatin remodeling', '*leukemia', '*nucleocytoplasmic transport', '*transcription']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4080-9413'],,,20191127,IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport']",['0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel FDA-approved PI3Kdelta inhibitor, CAL-101/idelalisib, leads to downregulation of p-AKT and increased apoptosis of CLL cells. Recently, two additional PI3K inhibitors have received FDA approval. As the PI3K/AKT pathway is also implicated in adhesion-mediated survival of ALL cells, PI3K inhibitors have been evaluated preclinically in ALL. However, PI3K inhibition has yet to be approved for clinical use in ALL. Here, we review the role of PI3K in normal hematopoietic cells, and in ALL.

However, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) continues to limit the long-term success of HSCT, and new therapies are still needed. We previously demonstrated that aGVHD depends on the ability of donor conventional T cells (Tcons) to express the lymph node trafficking receptor, CC-Chemokine Receptor 7 (CCR7). Consequently, we examined the ability of cosalane, a recently identified CCR7 small-molecule antagonist, to attenuate aGVHD in mouse HSCT model systems. Here we show that the systemic administration of cosalane to transplant recipients after allogeneic HSCT did not prevent aGVHD. However, we were able to significantly reduce aGVHD by briefly incubating donor Tcons with cosalane ex vivo before transplantation. Cosalane did not result in Tcon toxicity and did not affect their activation or expansion. Instead, cosalane prevented donor Tcon trafficking into host secondary lymphoid tissues very early after transplantation and limited their subsequent accumulation within the liver and colon. Cosalane did not appear to impair the intrinsic ability of donor Tcons to produce inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, cosalane-treated Tcons retained their graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) potential and rejected a murine P815 inoculum after transplantation. Collectively, our data indicate that a brief application of cosalane to donor Tcons before HSCT significantly reduces aGVHD in relevant preclinical models while generally sparing beneficial GVL effects, and that cosalane might represent a viable new approach for aGVHD prophylaxis.","['Fowler, Kenneth A', 'Li, Kelin', 'Whitehurst, Christopher B', 'Bruce, Danny W', 'Moorman, Nathaniel J', 'Aube, Jeffrey', 'Coghill, James M']","['Fowler KA', 'Li K', 'Whitehurst CB', 'Bruce DW', 'Moorman NJ', 'Aube J', 'Coghill JM']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Department of Internal Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

The current phase 1/2 study investigated the safety, maximum tolerated dose, and evidence of antileukemic activity for DFP-10917 administered by 7-day or 14-day continuous intravenous infusion in patients with recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: In the phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study, patients were administered DFP-10917 by 7-day continuous intravenous infusion plus 21-day rest (stage 1) or 14-day continuous intravenous infusion plus 14-day rest (stage 2). The primary objectives of phase 1 were to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the phase 2 dose, and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of DFP-10917. The primary objectives of phase 2 were to evaluate the overall response rate of DFP-10917 using complete response (CR), CR without platelet recovery (CRp), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or partial response. RESULTS: In stage 1 of phase 1 (4-35 mg/m(2) /day as a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion), a DLT of grade 3 diarrhea occurred at a dose of 35 mg/m(2) /day. In stage 2 of phase 1, a dose of 10 mg/m(2) /day as a 14-day continuous intravenous infusion resulted in DLTs of prolonged hypocellularity, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. The dose of 6 mg/m(2) /day as a 14-day continuous intravenous infusion was found to be well tolerated and was selected for phase 2. Response rates in patients in phase 2 (N = 29) were 20.7% CR, 3.4% CRp, and 24.1% CRi. The overall response rate was 48.3% (95% confidence interval, 29.4%-67.5%). CONCLUSIONS: DFP-10917 as a 14-day continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 6 mg/m(2) /day can be administered safely and appears to be effective in patients with recurrent or refractory AML. A phase 3 investigation comparing DFP-10917 monotherapy versus standard of care in an early recurrent or refractory AML setting is warranted.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Waukau, Jane B', 'Kwari, Monica I', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Anderson, Barry D', 'Iizuka, Kenzo', 'Jin, Cheng', 'Zhang, Chun', 'Plunkett, William K']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kadia TM', 'DiNardo CD', 'Daver NG', 'Borthakur G', 'Jain N', 'Waukau JB', 'Kwari MI', 'Ravandi F', 'Anderson BD', 'Iizuka K', 'Jin C', 'Zhang C', 'Plunkett WK']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Theradex Oncology, Princeton, New Jersey.', 'Delta-Fly Pharma Inc, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Delta-Fly Pharma Inc, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Delta-Fly Pharma Inc, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31923 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 May 15;125(10):1665-1673. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31923.

The site recode variables define the major cancer site/histology groups that are commonly used in the reporting of cancer incidence data and are added to the SEER databases as a convenience for researchers. These codes and definitions are periodically updated and changed by the National Cancer Institute as newer and more applicable information becomes available. Because this myeloma analysis includes cases diagnosed 2010+, the ICD-O-3 recode-updates with adjustment for WHO 2008 hematopoietic histologies that account for changes in the obsolete classification of hematopoietic histology codes, and the assignment of new names (ie, multiple myeloma-MM - to - plasma cell myeloma-PCM) is adhered to and used here. Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) is a bone-marrow based multifocal plasma cell malignancy (primary site C421). PCM is characterized by a single clone of plasma cells, believed to be derived from lymphoid B cells, and spans a clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to aggressive forms, plus disorders caused by the deposition of abnormal immunoglobulin chains in tissue. The current myeloma group ICD-O-3 histologic morphology types consists of: ICD-O-3 9731: Plasmacytoma, NOS, occurring in bone (osseous plasmacytoma malignancy data reportable to SEER only beginning since 1986); ICD-O-3 9732: Plasma cell myeloma - composed of three clinical variants: a) asymptomatic, b) Non-secretory myeloma, and c) Plasma cell leukemia (all coded to 9732); ICD-O-3 9734: Extramedullary plasmacytoma; anatomic sites other than bone. OBJECTIVE: -Using the statistical database of SEER*Stat 8.3.4 (produced 4/14/2017 for diagnosis years 1973-2014), to assess, determine, compare, and summarize the occurrence, long-term survival and mortality indices of the three morphologic types of myeloma by age, sex, race and stage in two-cohort entry time-periods (1973-1994 and 1995-2014). All analyses are accomplished within the context of current SEER Site Recode ICD-O-3 (1/27/2003) definitions, terminologies and descriptions, and also in accordance with the rules of the consolidated Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual data base (effective 1/1/2010 - release date January 2015). METHODS: -Population data including 111,041 cases collected by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Frequency Database (18 SEER Registries Research Data + Hurricane Katrina Impacted Louisiana Cases, November 2016 Submission, 1973-2014 varying) for diagnosis years 1973-2014: Relative Survival Statistics were analyzed in two cohorts: 1973-1994 and 1995-2014. Survival statistics were derived from: SEER*Stat Database: Incidence - SEER 9 Regs Research Data, November 2016 Submission (1973-2014) <Katrina/Rita Population Adjustment> Released April 2017. RESULTS: -Tables 1-3 provide basic SEER comparative survival and mortality data of the three myeloma oncotypes by age, sex, stage and disease duration of patients in the 1973-2014 time-period. Epidemiologic, demographic, and case statistics data extracted from the most current NCI Cancer Statistics Review (CSR 2010-2014) are included. CONCLUSIONS: -Recent SEER age-adjusted incidence trends, 2011-2014, for all races has been downward, with an annual percentage change (APC) of -2.5% per year. Mean age in plasma cell myeloma (PCM) patients was about 1-year less in males (67.8 yrs) than in females (69.2 yrs). PCM is accompanied by a very high excess mortality and much reduced 5-year relative survival ratio especially in older age groups. Generally, first year excess death rates (EDRs) decreased with duration but increased with advancing entry age, and there was no sex difference. First year EDRs in blacks, all ages combined, was quite high but lower than EDRs in whites. Median survival, actual survival and 5-year relative survival ratios diminished precipitously to extremely low levels with increasing entry age attesting to the lethal character of this disease especially in older patients.","['Milano, Anthony F']",['Milano AF'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20190122,United States,J Insur Med,"Journal of insurance medicine (New York, N.Y.)",8401468,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2019/04/20 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17849/insm-47-04-1-9.1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Insur Med. 2018;47(4):203-211. doi: 10.17849/insm-47-04-1-9.1.

All patients were treated according to the AML 01.10 protocol. Cumulative production of MMSCs from AML patients at diagnosis was normal but increased during treatment. Most of the studied genes were upregulated at AML diagnosis, some (IL6, IL1B, LIF) remained upregulated during treatment, and others were downregulated (FGFR1, ICAM1) or normalized. A few genes were normal at diagnosis but decreased during treatment (FGF2, FGFR2, VEGF, SDF1, SOX9, TGFB1). The upregulation of proinflammatory genes both at diagnosis and during remission reflects ongoing inflammation. PDGFRB expression was upregulated in MMSCs from patients in relapse versus those in remission. The AML 01.10 protocol downregulates the expression of genes related to proliferation, differentiation and niche formation.","['Shipounova, Irina N', 'Petinati, Nataliya A', 'Bigildeev, Alexey E', 'Sorokina, Tamara V', 'Kuzmina, Larisa A', 'Parovichnikova, Elena N', 'Savchenko, Valery G']","['Shipounova IN', 'Petinati NA', 'Bigildeev AE', 'Sorokina TV', 'Kuzmina LA', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Savchenko VG']","['a Ministry of Health , Physiology of Hematopoiesis Lab, Federal Government Budget Institution National Research Center for Hematology , Moscow , Russian Federation.', 'a Ministry of Health , Physiology of Hematopoiesis Lab, Federal Government Budget Institution National Research Center for Hematology , Moscow , Russian Federation.', 'a Ministry of Health , Physiology of Hematopoiesis Lab, Federal Government Budget Institution National Research Center for Hematology , Moscow , Russian Federation.', 'b Scientific and Clinical Department of Chemotherapy for Hematological Diseases with a Day Hospital , Federal Government Budget Institution National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health , Moscow , Russian Federation.', 'c Department of High-dose Chemotherapy , Depressions of Hematopoiesis and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Federal Government Budget Institution National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health , Moscow , Russian Federation.', 'c Department of High-dose Chemotherapy , Depressions of Hematopoiesis and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Federal Government Budget Institution National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health , Moscow , Russian Federation.', 'd CEO of Federal Government Budget Institution, National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health , Moscow , Russian Federation.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190122,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2020/08/12 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1554861 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Aug;60(8):2042-2049. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1554861.

The current situation was compared to a theoretical situation in which either patient or physician adherence is improved, in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Current patient adherence rate is 74%, improvement to 100% resulted in 0.1031 QALYs gained and a saving of euro17,509 per patient over a 25-year period. Improving physician adherence from 72% to 100%, resulted in 0.0380 QALYs and euro7606. Enhancement of either adherence results in substantial health gain and cost savings.

However, mutational profiling alone may not always help dissect underlying epigenetic dependencies in tumorigenesis. Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that regulates transcriptional architecture and is involved in cell fate commitment. We demonstrate that loss of MBD3, an important NuRD scaffold, in human primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells associates with leukemic NuRD. Interestingly, CHD4, an intact ATPase subunit of leukemic NuRD, coimmunoprecipitates and participates with H3K27Me3/2-demethylase KDM6A to induce expression of atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factors, dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) 5 and 8 (DOCK5/8), promoting Rac GTPase signaling. Mechanistically, MBD3 deficiency caused loss of histone deacytelase 1 occupancy with a corresponding increase in KDM6A, CBP, and H3K27Ac on DOCK5/8 loci, leading to derepression of gene expression. Importantly, the Cancer Genome Atlas AML cohort reveals that DOCK5/ 8 levels are correlated with MBD3 and KDM6A, and DOCK5/ 8 expression is significantly increased in patients who are MBD3 low and KDM6A high with a poor survival. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of DOCK signaling selectively attenuates AML cell survival. Because MBD3 and KDM6A have been implicated in metastasis, our results may suggest a general phenomenon in tumorigenesis. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for MBD3-deficient NuRD in leukemia pathobiology and inform a novel epistasis between NuRD and KDM6A toward maintenance of oncogenic gene expression in AML.-Biswas, M., Chatterjee, S. S., Boila, L. D., Chakraborty, S., Banerjee, D., Sengupta, A.

In this work, a composite drug nanocarrier based on BP NS is proposed, which can perform a synergetic and targeted chemophotothermal therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). First, BP NS were prepared by an improved liquid exfoliation technique. Then, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was modified on the surfaces of BP NS through electrostatic adsorption. Drug molecules can also be loaded onto the BP NS via electrostatic adsorption. The PEG layer can effectively protect the interior BP NS from water and air to enhance their physiological stability. The obtained PEGylated BP NS (BP NS@PEG) not only demonstrated an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and photothermal stability but also exhibited a good pH and photothermal dual-responsive drug release behavior. In addition, the BP NS@PEG were further modified with Sgc8 aptamers through covalent bonding. The aptamers provided an efficient specificity toward ALL cells (CCRF-CEM) and greatly increased the endocytosis of the nanocarriers through a receptor-mediated manner, which can further improve the therapeutic effect. Hence, the presented BP NS-based multifunctional nanocarrier can achieve a targeted and synergetic chemophotothermal therapy of ALL, which shows a promising potential in improving the curative efficiency.","['Zong, Shenfei', 'Wang, Lingling', 'Yang, Zhaoyan', 'Wang, Hong', 'Wang, Zhuyuan', 'Cui, Yiping']","['Zong S', 'Wang L', 'Yang Z', 'Wang H', 'Wang Z', 'Cui Y']","['Advanced Photonics Center , Southeast University , Nanjing 210096 , China.', 'Advanced Photonics Center , Southeast University , Nanjing 210096 , China.', 'Advanced Photonics Center , Southeast University , Nanjing 210096 , China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine , The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University , Nanjing 210029 , China.', 'Advanced Photonics Center , Southeast University , Nanjing 210096 , China.', 'Advanced Photonics Center , Southeast University , Nanjing 210096 , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190201,United States,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,ACS applied materials & interfaces,101504991,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2019/06/01 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsami.8b22563 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2019 Feb 13;11(6):5896-5902. doi: 10.1021/acsami.8b22563.

Methylxanthines have raised more interest in research on modifying their structure because of their diverse biological activity. In addition, the piperazine nucleus is one of the most important heterocycles exhibiting remarkable pharmacological activities. METHODS: The structure of the obtained compounds was characterized and elucidated by IR, 1H and 13C NMR and LCMS spectral analysis. The purity of the substances was proven by corresponding melting points and elemental analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by four common methods - DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation assay. The cytotoxic effects of the tested series were evaluated using the standard MTT-dye reduction assay on three tumour cell lines. RESULTS: A series of new xanthine derivatives comprising an arylpiperazine moiety at N1 were synthesized. The cytotoxicity against human T-cell leukemia cell SKW-3, human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 and human Bcell precursor leukemia cell REH was evaluated. The relationship between the structure and citotoxicity of the compounds was investigated by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis and the important structural parameters were drawn. CONCLUSION: The highest antioxidant activity was demonstrated by compound 6c. The highest cytotoxic effect was observed for compound 6f. It was found that cytotoxicity against SKW-3 depends on the electron density distribution in the structures. Branching of the molecular skeleton and introduction of heteroatoms like fluorine and sulfur in the structures also significantly improved the antiproliferative activity of the compounds.","['Andonova, Lily', 'Valkova, Iva', 'Zheleva-Dimitrova, Dimitrina', 'Georgieva, Maya', 'Momekov, Georgi', 'Zlatkov, Alexander']","['Andonova L', 'Valkova I', 'Zheleva-Dimitrova D', 'Georgieva M', 'Momekov G', 'Zlatkov A']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University-Sofia, 2 , Bulgaria.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University-Sofia, 2 , Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, 2 Dunav Street, 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University-Sofia, 2 , Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacotherapy and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University-Sofia, 2 , Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University-Sofia, 2 , Bulgaria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2020/02/28 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-95985 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666190121155651 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2019;19(4):528-537. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666190121155651.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aralkylpiperazine', '*QSAR', '*antioxidant effect', '*cytotoxicity', '*leukemia cell SKW-3', '*theobromine.']",,,,,,20200227,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Piperazines/*chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xanthines/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Xanthines)']",,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with RA between 1996 and 2009 who underwent treatment at the Daegu Catholic University Medical Center were retrospectively examined. 1885 patients with RA were included in the analyses. Occurrence of cancer and death during follow up was ascertained by linking medical records to the Korean Central Cancer Registry and national death certificates. For comparing cancer incidence between RA patients and general population, standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SIRs were calculated using the shortcut method introduced by Vandenbroucke. RESULTS: The total follow-up time was 10218.9 person-years. During follow up, 100 patients (31 men and 69 women) were diagnosed with cancer. Both men and women had greater risks of having malignancy, although cancer risk was greater in men. Men showed increased risks of lung cancer (SIR=5.46, 95% CI: 2.60-9.36) and leukemia (SIR=16.7, 95% CI: 1.58-47.9). Women showed increased risks of thyroid cancer (SIR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.02-2.68), cervical cancer (SIR=3.65, 95% CI: 1.65-6.42), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR=6.47, 95% CI: 2.04-13.4), and gallbladder cancer (SIR=3.87, 95% CI: 1.01-8.60). Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs usage and cancer were not related: the relative risks of developing malignancy were not elevated for each medicine. CONCLUSION: The overall cancer incidence was increased in Korean men and women with RA. Increased risk of specific malignancy differed according to sex.","['Lee, Hwajeong']",['Lee H'],"['Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Arthritis & Autoimmunity Research Center, Daegu Catholic University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea. hlee@cu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,PMC6342720,['The author has no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],2019/01/23 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['60.223 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2019.60.2.223 [doi]']",ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 2019 Feb;60(2):223-229. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2019.60.2.223.,['NOTNLM'],"['Rheumatoid arthritis', 'cancer', 'incidence', 'malignancy', 'standardized incidence ratio']",,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1592-7314'],,,20190225,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antirheumatic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)'],,,['(c) Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children's normal B lymphocytes and Nalm-6 cells were cultured. Nalm-6 cells were transfected with PIK3CA siRNA (siPIK3CA group) or its negative control (PIK3CA-Control group). Normal Nalm-6 cells were named Mock group. Nalm-6 cells transfected by PIK3CA siRNA were treated with Akt inhibitor (siPIK3CA+Akti-1/2 group). mRNA and protein expression was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Proliferation and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs was detected by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis was explored by low cytometry. Transwell assay was performed to test invasion. RESULTS: PIK3CA mRNA (p=0.008) and protein (p=0.006) expression was higher in Nalm-6 cells than that in normal B lymphocytes. Compared with the Mock group and PIK3CA-Control group, Nalm-6 cells of the siPIK3CA group had lower OD495 values (all p<0.05) and invasion cell numbers (p=0.03 and p=0.025), as well as a higher proportion of G0/G1 phase cells (p=0.020 and p=0.022), percentage of apoptosis (p=0.016 and p=0.022), and inhibition rate (all p<0.05). pAkt expression in the siPIK3CA group (p=0.026 and p=0.031) and siPIK3CA+Akti-1/2 group (p=0.019 and p=0.023) was lower than that in the Mock group. CONCLUSION: PIK3CA silencing inhibited Nalm-6 cell proliferation and invasion, and promoted their apoptosis and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, potentially through regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","['Liang, Xiuling', 'Xin, Xianfang', 'Qi, Dongmei', 'Fu, Chengyan', 'Ding, Mingde']","['Liang X', 'Xin X', 'Qi D', 'Fu C', 'Ding M']","[""Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Taishan Medical University, Tai'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Taishan Medical University, Tai'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Taishan Medical University, Tai'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Taishan Medical University, Tai'an, China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Affiliated Hospital of Taishan Medical University, Tai'an, China. dingmingde24@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,PMC6342719,['The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],2019/01/23 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['60.182 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2019.60.2.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 2019 Feb;60(2):182-190. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2019.60.2.182.,['NOTNLM'],"['PIK3CA', 'apoptosis', 'childhood leukemia cells', 'invasion', 'proliferation']",,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2868-9642', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6796-9436', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9350-6235', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1181-5286', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5629-0858']",,,20190225,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Child', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,['(c) Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) following chemotherapy is now a standard therapy for ATL in Japan as it can achieve long-term remission in approximately one-third of recipient ATL patients; however, it also has a risk of treatment-related mortality. Allo-HSCT often induces HTLV-1 Tax-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) as well as graft-versus-host (GVH) response in ATL patients. This observation led to development of a new therapeutic vaccine to activate Tax-specific CTL, anticipating anti-ATL effects without GVH response. The newly developed Tax-DC vaccine consists of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with Tax peptides corresponding to CTL epitopes that have been identified in post-allo-HSCT ATL patients. In a pilot study of Tax-DC therapy in three ATL patients after various initial therapies, two patients survived for more than 4 years after vaccination without severe adverse effects (UMIN000011423). The Tax-DC vaccine is currently under phase I trial, showing a promising clinical outcome so far. These findings indicate the importance of patients' own HTLV-1-specific T-cell responses in maintaining remission and provide a new approach to anti-ATL immunotherapy targeting Tax. Although Tax-targeted vaccination is ineffective against Tax-negative ATL cells, it can be a safe alternative maintenance therapy for Tax-positive ATL and may be further applicable for treatment of indolent ATL or even prophylaxis of ATL development among HTLV-1-carriers.","['Kannagi, Mari', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Nagano, Yoshiko', 'Iino, Tadafumi', 'Okamura, Jun', 'Suehiro, Youko']","['Kannagi M', 'Hasegawa A', 'Nagano Y', 'Iino T', 'Okamura J', 'Suehiro Y']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Advanced Medicine Innovation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Institute for Clinical Research, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190219,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC6398881,,2019/01/23 06:00,2019/03/09 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13948 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Mar;110(3):849-857. doi: 10.1111/cas.13948.

A key property of Tr1 cells is the capability to produce high-level interleukin 10 (IL-10) upon activation, in a FOXP3-independent manner. The immunosuppressive function of IL-10 producing Tr1 cells has been extensively studied for many years. Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are conditions in which the immune system breaks down and starts to attack the body. AIDs include inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes mellitus, Greaves' disease, and so forth. In recent years, more and more studies have documented that the number of Tr1 cells is decreased and the function is inhibited in a variety of AIDs, among which MS is the most widely studied. The protocol for engineering Tr1 cell therapy has been established and is gradually being used in clinical practice in recent years. Tr1 cell therapy has been proven to be safe and effective, but it is mainly involved in myeloid leukemia, graft versus host disease currently. Its therapeutic role in AIDs still needs to be further explored. In this study, we will summarize the research advances of Tr1 cells in AIDs, which will provide useful information for treating AIDs through Tr1 cell therapy in the future.","['Jia, Xi', 'Zhai, Tianyu', 'Wang, Bing', 'Yao, Qiuming', 'Li, Qian', 'Mu, Kaida', 'Zhang, Jin-An']","['Jia X', 'Zhai T', 'Wang B', 'Yao Q', 'Li Q', 'Mu K', 'Zhang JA']","['Department of Endocrinology, Jinshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Jinshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Jinshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Jinshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Affiliated Zhoupu Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Affiliated Zhoupu Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190121,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2020/05/22 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28092 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(8):12442-12450. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28092.

A higher number of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 13), brain tumors (n = 6), lymphoma (n = 4), and bone/soft tissue sarcomas (n = 5) tended to develop TE. The male/female ratio was 17/16, and the median age at TE diagnosis was 10 years and 2 months. TE was detected a median of 2 months after cancer diagnosis. Symptoms including pain and swelling were present in 18 of the 33 patients. In terms of location, three intracerebral, 23 upper venous, six lower venous and one combined upper and lower venous system TEs were observed. Additional risk factors for TE included central venous catheter (CVC) use in 12 patients, steroid and/or L-asparaginase use in nine, and CVC and steroid and/or L-asparaginase use in seven. The TE incidence rate was quite low among Korean children with cancer, but higher than in the general pediatric population and among children hospitalized for diseases other than cancer.

In AML patients, CMV replication may be a protective predictor against disease relapse, although the potential benefit of CMV replication is offset by increased NRM.","['Zhang, Yu-Lin', 'Zhu, Yan', 'Xiao, Qing', 'Wang, Li', 'Liu, Lin', 'Luo, Xiao-Hua']","['Zhang YL', 'Zhu Y', 'Xiao Q', 'Wang L', 'Liu L', 'Luo XH']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 1 Youyi Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400016, China. xiaohua.luo@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20190121,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3585-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3585-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Apr;98(4):1009-1020. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3585-1.

Secondary AML may arise from the evolution of an antecedent hematologic disorder, or it may arise as a complication of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the case of therapy-related AML. Because of the high frequency of poor-risk cytogenetics and high-risk molecular features, such as alterations in TP53, leukemic clones are often inherently chemoresistant. Standard of care induction had long remained conventional 7 + 3 until its reformulation as CPX-351, recently FDA approved specifically for secondary AML. However, recent data also suggests relatively favorable outcomes with regimens based on high-dose cytarabine or hypomethylating agents.

Here we will review the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of CRS. RECENT FINDINGS: Efforts have been initiated to define and grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS), to identify patients at risk, to describe biomarkers that predict onset and severity, to understand the pathophysiology, and to prevent and treat severe cases to reduce T cell immunotherapy-related morbidity and mortality. Optimizing the timing of T cell-based therapies in ALL, identifying new biomarkers, and investigating novel anti-cytokine agents that have anti-CRS activity are likely to be fruitful avenues of study.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Khaled, Samer K', 'Budde, Elizabeth', 'Stein, Anthony S']","['Aldoss I', 'Khaled SK', 'Budde E', 'Stein AS']","['Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, 1500 Duarte Rd, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, 1500 Duarte Rd, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, 1500 Duarte Rd, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, 1500 Duarte Rd, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA. astein@coh.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190121,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,,2019/01/23 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-019-0753-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-019-0753-y [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2019 Jan 21;21(1):4. doi: 10.1007/s11912-019-0753-y.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Blinatumomab', '*Chimeric antigen receptor', '*Cytokine release syndrome', '*Immunotherapy', '*T cell therapy']",,,,,,20200320,IM,"['Cytokine Release Syndrome/etiology/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idarubicin (IDA) is one of the most common chemotherapeutic drugs used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, severe side effects and drug resistance markedly limit the application of IDA. Methods: In this study, we encapsulated IDA in polymeric NPs and validated their antileukemia activity in vitro and in vivo. Results: NPs with an average diameter of 84 nm was assembled from a methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (mPEG-PLGA). After loading of IDA, IDA-loaded mPEG-PLGA NPs (IDA/mPEG-PLGA NPs) were formed. The in vitro release data showed that the IDA/mPEG-PLGA NPs have excellent sustained release property. IDA/mPEG-PLGA NPs had exhibited the lower IC50 than pure IDA. Moreover, IDA/mPEG-PLGA NPs in the same concentration substantially induced apoptosis than did pure IDA. Most importantly, IDA/MPEG-PLGA NPs significantly decreased the infiltration of leukemia blasts and improved the overall survival of MLL-AF9-induced murine leukemia compared with free IDA. However, the blank NPs were nontoxic to normal cultured cells in vitro, suggesting that NPs were the safe carrier. Conclusion: Our data suggest that IDA/mPEG-PLGA NPs might be a suitable carrier to encapsulate IDA. Low dose of IDA/mPEG-PLGA NPs can be used as a conventional dosage for antileukemia therapy to reduce side effect and improve survival.","['Liang, Bin', 'Li, Na', 'Zhang, Shuofei', 'Qi, Aihua', 'Feng, Jianhua', 'Jing, Weiwei', 'Shi, Changcan', 'Ma, Zhaipu', 'Gao, Shenmeng']","['Liang B', 'Li N', 'Zhang S', 'Qi A', 'Feng J', 'Jing W', 'Shi C', 'Ma Z', 'Gao S']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nanbaixiang, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.', 'Wenzhou Institute of Biomaterials and Engineering, CNITECH, CAS, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.', 'Department of Orthodontics, Stomatological Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.', ""Department of Internal Medicine, Zaoqiang People's Hospital, Zaoqiang, Hebei 053100, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nanbaixiang, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wenzhou Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.', 'Wenzhou Institute of Biomaterials and Engineering, CNITECH, CAS, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, College of Life Science, Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei 071002, China, zhaipuma@hbu.edu.cn.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Nanbaixiang, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325000, China, gaoshenmeng77@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190111,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC6333394,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2019/01/23 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S190027 [doi]', 'ijn-14-543 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2019 Jan 11;14:543-556. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S190027. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'idarubicin', 'mPEG-PLGA', 'nanoparticles']",,,,,,20190219,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Polyesters/*chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (methoxypolyethyleneglycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the diagnosis and treatment of CML, peripheral blood or bone marrow samples are usually taken for analysis. However, both methods are invasive sample collection methods, thus a noninvasive saliva sample method for the detection of the fusion gene transcripts (BCR-ABL) was investigated in some Nigerians with CML. Materials and Methods: Real-time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was used to detect BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in the saliva and blood of 42 Nigerian CML patients. RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit and reverse transcribed by random hexamer priming using murine Moloney reverse transcriptase. BCR-ABL1 transcript types were first detected by multiplex PCR and then quantified by a duplex RT-PCR-TaqMan chemistry with MGB probe and Black Hole Quencher. Results: Of the 42 subjects, transcript types were detected in 36 (85.7%) samples, e13a2 fusion transcript sub-type was detected in 9 (21.4%), whereas e14a2 subtype was found in 27 (67.3%); six (14.3%) of the samples did not reveal any of the fusion transcript subtypes. The median BCR-ABL1 messenger RNA values were 9.38 x 10(2) in saliva and 10.29 x 10(4) in blood (P < 0.05). Similarly, the median ABL1 value in saliva (3.11 x 10(3)) was significantly lower (P < 0.01) than in blood (4.22 x 10(3)). However, the median BCR-ABL1 ratio in saliva (14.5%) was not significantly different (P = 0.8) from that of blood (12.0%). Conclusion: Saliva may offer an alternative easy-to-collect, readily available, and noninvasive sample for the diagnosis and treatment of CML.","['Uzoma, I C', 'Taiwo, I A', 'Nna, E O', 'Durosinmi, M A', 'Ukaejiofo, E O']","['Uzoma IC', 'Taiwo IA', 'Nna EO', 'Durosinmi MA', 'Ukaejiofo EO']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences and Technology, University of Nigeria, Enugu; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Genetics Laboratory, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Genetics Laboratory, Faculty of Science, University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria.', 'The Molecular Pathology Institute, Safety Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Enugu, Nigeria.', 'Department of Haematology, Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences and Technology, University of Nigeria, Enugu, Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Niger J Clin Pract,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,101150032,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],2019/01/23 06:00,2019/01/31 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['NigerJClinPract_2019_22_1_51_250506 [pii]', '10.4103/njcp.njcp_225_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Niger J Clin Pract. 2019 Jan;22(1):51-55. doi: 10.4103/njcp.njcp_225_18.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Nigeria', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'saliva']",,,,,,20190130,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Saliva', 'Young Adult']","['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cryptically, B19V causes significant morbidity and mortality. Half of the world population and 60 per cent of Indians are known to be serologically naive and are at risk of acquiring B19V infections. Cumulatively, our data showed 21.3 per cent B19V-infected patients with juvenile chronic arthropathy, recurrent abortions, multi-transfused thalassaemia and leukaemia. In addition, B19V-infected cases that ended fatally included patients with pure red cell aplasia, fulminant hepatitis and haemophagocytic syndrome. Novel clinical associations of B19V observed were amegakaryocytic thrombocytopaenia, myositis and non-occlusive ischaemic gangrene of bowel. B19V possesses multiple receptors which are distributed widely in human tissues. Vascular endothelial cell infection by B19V causes endothelialitis and vasculitic injuries besides antibody-dependent enhancement which empowered B19V to cause multiorgan diseases. Owing to lack of suitable animal model for B19V, true causal role remains to be determined, but numerous reports on B19V infections substantiate a causal role in multiorgan diseases. Hence, B19V infections need to be recognized, investigated and treated besides making efforts on vaccine developments.","['Kishore, Janak', 'Kishore, Divya']","['Kishore J', 'Kishore D']","['Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India.', 'Guru Nanak Eye Centre, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,PMC6362725,['None'],2019/01/23 06:00,2019/05/31 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJMedRes_2018_148_4_373_250539 [pii]', '10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_533_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2018 Oct;148(4):373-384. doi: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_533_18.,['NOTNLM'],"['Anaemia', 'PRCA', 'cardiotropic virus', 'endothelialitis', 'mechanisms', 'multiorgan', 'parvovirus B19', 'vasculitis', 'viral proteins', 'virus-host interaction']",,,,,,20190530,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/virology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/epidemiology/virology', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Kidney Diseases/epidemiology/virology', 'Liver Diseases/epidemiology/virology', 'Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology/virology', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*complications/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/epidemiology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to define whether blood count recovery-based CR before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) had an impact on survival in patients with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study has been performed in a retrospective manner. One hundred one patients with AML who received an alloHSCT in our transplant center at Hacettepe University Hospital between the years 2001 and 2018 were evaluated. CRi were defined as bone marrow CR with absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm(3) and/or platelet count < 100.000/mm(3). CR and CRi were confirmed just before alloHSCT in bone marrow and peripheral blood, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were entered into the study between 2001 and 2018. Median follow-up for all survivors was 38 months (range, 6-220 months). The 5-year overall survival for patients who were in CRi and patients who were in CR before transplantation were 58% and 67%, respectively (P = .68). The 5-year progression-free survival for patients who were in CRi and patients who were in CR before transplantation were 68% and 64%, respectively (P = .99). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we observed equivalent posttransplant outcomes between patients who were in CR and patients who were in CRi before alloHSCT. We assume that alloHSCT eliminated the negative effect of pre-transplant blood count levels.","['Ciftciler, Rafiye', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Goker, Hakan']","['Ciftciler R', 'Demiroglu H', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Aksu S', 'Goker H']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.

The downregulation of TRADD is found to be associated with the occurrence of many cancers. The present study was designed to investigate the association between TRADD and clinicopathologic features as well as its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed in 100 new AML, 23 AML complete remission patients, and 20 normal individuals. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: It was found that the expression of TRADD messenger RNA was lower in new AML patients as compared to healthy individuals and complete remission patients (P=0.00239). Moreover, TRADD messenger RNA levels were associated with clinical factors such as risk classification (P=0.0023) and complete remission (P=0.0147). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the AML patients with high TRADD expression had significantly prolonged overall survival and higher complete remission compared with low TRADD expressing patients. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that downregulation of TRADD may be an independent potential prognostic biomarker in AML.","['Xiao, Yi', 'Geng, Zhe', 'Deng, Taoran', 'Wang, Di', 'Jiang, Lijun']","['Xiao Y', 'Geng Z', 'Deng T', 'Wang D', 'Jiang L']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

Although there are a few reports on EPS developing in non-peritoneal dialysis patients, it has not been reported in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Here, we report a case of EPS after a second HSCT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome showed relapse after HSCT and received a second HSCT. The patient was diagnosed with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD)-associated serositis because of persistent ascites. His ascites improved gradually and disappeared without immunosuppressive therapy. He presented with nausea, weight loss, and constipation 1 year after improvement of ascites. Computed tomography revealed no organic obstruction, but did reveal dilated, thickened, and adhered small bowel loops with a mass-like appearance. He was diagnosed with EPS on the basis of clinical symptoms and image findings. He received corticosteroid therapy (20 mg/body) without any improvement in symptoms. He developed recurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome at 1 month after initiation of corticosteroid therapy. This progressed into acute myeloid leukaemia after 3 months. He died 31 months after the second HSCT. At autopsy, the small and large intestines had formed extensive adhesions and showed signs of progressive fibrosis with peritoneal sclerosis, fibroblast swelling, fibrin deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltration, which confirmed the diagnosis of EPS. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that EPS may complicate patients with cGVHD-associated serositis. Although the mechanism of EPS development is not clear, clinicians should be aware of this eventuality.","['Shimomura, Yoshimitsu', 'Sakai, Shinsuke', 'Ueda, Hiroyuki', 'Fujikura, Kohei', 'Imai, Yukihiro', 'Ishikawa, Takayuki']","['Shimomura Y', 'Sakai S', 'Ueda H', 'Fujikura K', 'Imai Y', 'Ishikawa T']","['Department of Hematology, Kobe City Hospital Organization, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, 2-1-1 Minatojima-Minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan. shimomura_0119@yahoo.co.jp.', 'Department of Nephrology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Kobe City Hospital Organization, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Kobe City Hospital Organization, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Kobe City Hospital Organization, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kobe City Hospital Organization, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, 2-1-1 Minatojima-Minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190121,England,BMC Gastroenterol,BMC gastroenterology,100968547,PMC6341688,,2019/01/23 06:00,2019/01/31 06:00,['2019/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12876-019-0933-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12876-019-0933-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Gastroenterol. 2019 Jan 21;19(1):12. doi: 10.1186/s12876-019-0933-0.,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'And encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis', 'Chronic graft-versus-host disease', 'Serositis']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1018-9508'],,,20190130,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Peritoneal Fibrosis/*etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No standard-of-care has been established. No USA registry-based analyses have examined clinical correlates of overall survival (OS) in MCL patients, thus we aimed to do this using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and the National Cancer Database (NCDB). MATERIALS/METHODS: We included 25 patients from SEER, and 50 patients from NCDB diagnosed with MCL through 2015. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the impact of clinical characteristics on OS in each dataset, and on a pooled cohort of both datasets. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis for the pooled cohort was 63 years, and median OS was 9.4 months. The proportion of patients surviving 12, 36, and 60 months was 42.9%, 23.2%, and 16.6%, respectively. Males (n = 44, 58.7%) outnumbered females (n = 31, 41.3%). Caucasians formed a majority (n = 66, 88%). With Cox regression accounting for database of origin, age at and year of diagnosis, sex, race, sequence number, and receipt of chemotherapy, no variable was significantly associated with OS. However, in the same analysis, when stratified by sex, receipt of chemotherapy was associated with improved OS in males (HR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.14-0.89, p < 0.03), and poorer OS in females (HR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.07-12.44, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reaffirms that MCL carries a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy may improve survival in subsets of patients, though generalizability is limited by biases inherent in registry-based datasets. Due to poor outcomes for MCL patients, more study is needed to determine optimal care.","['Budnik, Justin', 'Milano, Michael T']","['Budnik J', 'Milano MT']","['University of Rochester, Department of Radiation Oncology, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, NY, 14642, United States.

Here, we investigated the expression of CD73 and A2aR as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We found that CD73 expression on tumor cells, rather than the total protein and gene levels of CD73, was associated with survival. Patients with CD73(+) /Pax-5(+) (median survival, 57.8 months; 95% CI, 46.4-69.3) experienced significantly poorer outcomes than those with CD73(-) /Pax-5(+) (median survival, 73.5 months; 95% CI, 65.9-81.2). Additionally, A2aR expression on both total TILs and CD8(+) TILs was correlated with survival. Patients with A2aR(+) TILs (median survival, 53.3 months; 95% CI, 40.6-66.0) had a significantly shorter survival time than patients with A2aR(-) TILs (median survival, 74.5 months; 95% CI, 67.5-81.5). Spearman's rank test showed that CD73 expression on tumor cells was positively correlated with A2aR expression on TILs (R = 0.395, p = 0.001). We further found that patients could be more precisely stratified through the combination of CD73 tumor cell expression and A2aR TILs expression, and patients with CD73(+) /Pax-5(+) and A2aR(+) TILs experienced the worst outcome. We also revealed that patients with CD73(+) /Pax-5(+) and low CD8(+) TILs or low absolute lymphocyte counts had unfavorable outcomes. Overall, our findings uncovered that patients with CD73(+) on tumor cells as well as A2aR(+) on TILs or low CD8(+) TILs exhibited inferior survival, supporting potential combination strategies using CD73/A2aR immunosuppressive blockades as treatment options for DLBCL patients.","['Wang, Xianhuo', 'Zhang, Tingting', 'Song, Zheng', 'Li, Linyu', 'Zhang, Xuhan', 'Liu, Jing', 'Liu, Xianming', 'Qiu,

However, a high transplant-related mortality (TRM) rate was reported in previous series of patients and questioned the role of transplant in this disease. Recently, experienced groups have shown a significant TRM decrease that has been attributed to an accurate selection of patients. Moreover, application of several supportive measures has decreased toxicity over amyloid-involved organs. We analyzed a series of 66 patients with AL amyloidosis, who underwent ASCT at a single institution and evaluated the impact of these measures beyond patient selection. Four temporary groups were established: group-A (non-selection plus post-transplant G-CSF use) with 29 patients, group-B (selection) with 13, group-C (selection and G-CSF avoidance) with 14, and group-D (selection, G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroid's prophylaxis) with 10. A decreasing TRM was observed over time from group-A (38%), to group-D (0%); p = 0.02. We also observed a progressive increase of three-year OS from 62% in group-A to 100% in group-D; p = 0.049. On the multivariate analysis, cardiac involvement was the only independent predictor of survival. Therefore, tailored selection policy together with transplant supportive measures have allowed ASCT to be a safe procedure in AL amyloidosis.","['Gutierrez-Garcia, Gonzalo', 'Cibeira, Maria Teresa',

Although a prospective randomized controlled study showed that VCAP-AMP-VECP was superior to CHOP, the trial was rather small and no subsequent studies confirmed the benefit of VCAP-AMP-VECP over CHOP. We conducted a retrospective analysis of transplant-eligible patients with ATL who received only VCAP-AMP-VECP or CHOP, incorporating inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scoring. Overall, 947 and 513 patients were treated with VCAP-AMP-VECP and CHOP, respectively. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 1006 days. The crude probabilities of 2-year overall survival (OS) for patients in the VCAP-AMP-VECP and CHOP groups were 31.2% and 24.6%, respectively (P < 0.001). Stratified by risk group according to the modified ATL-prognostic index score at diagnosis, the crude probabilities of 2-year OS in the VCAP-AMP-VECP and CHOP groups were 39.8 and 45.0% in the low-risk group (P = 0.69), 32.2 and 21.6% in the intermediate-risk group (P < 0.001), and 17.2 and 6.2% in the high-risk group (P = 0.005). Our current analysis suggests that VCAP-AMP-VECP regimen is a preferable front-line therapy in patients with aggressive ATL in intermediate- and high-risk groups.","['Fuji, Shigeo', 'Yamaguchi, Takuhiro', 'Inoue, Yoshitaka', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Owatari, Satsuki', 'Miyagi, Takashi', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Otsuka, Eiichi', 'Yoshida, Shin-Ichiro', 'Fukuda, Takahiro']","['Fuji S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Inoue Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Owatari S', 'Miyagi T', 'Sawayama Y', 'Otsuka E', 'Yoshida SI', 'Fukuda T']","['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. fujishige1231@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Japan. fujishige1231@gmail.com.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kagoshima Medical Center, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Heart-Life Hospital, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita Prefectural Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190121,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,2019/01/22 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2018/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-019-0446-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-019-0446-z [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Sep;54(9):1399-1405. doi: 10.1038/s41409-019-0446-z.

Patients were consecutively registered with the EBMT at the time of transplantation and followed by routine EBMT monitoring but with an extended dataset. Between 2007 and 2012, 37 evaluable patients (median age 56 years) were accrued. Pre-treatment contained alemtuzumab in 95% of patients. Sixty-two percent were in complete remission (CR) at the time of allo-SCT. Conditioning contained total body irradiation with 6 Gy or more (TBI6) in 30% of patients. With a median follow-up of 50 months, the 4-year non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival were 32, 38, 30 and 42%, respectively. By univariate analysis, TBI6 in the conditioning was the only significant predictor for a low relapse risk, and an interval between diagnosis and allo-SCT of more than 12 months was associated with a lower NRM. This study confirms for the first time prospectively that allo-SCT can provide long-term disease control in a sizable albeit limited proportion of patients with T-PLL.","['Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, W', 'Drozd-Sokolowska, J', 'Eikema, D J', 'Hoek, J', 'Potter, M', 'Wulf, G', 'Sellner, L', 'Ljungman, P', 'Chevallier, P', 'Volin, L', 'Koc, Y', 'Martin, S', 'Bunjes, D', 'Rovira, M', 'Itala-Remes, M', 'Foa, R', 'Deconinck, E', 'Gedde-Dahl, T', 'Cornelissen, J', 'Collin, M', 'Brecht, A', 'Patel, A', 'de Groot, M', 'Remenyi, P', 'Nagler, A', 'Finke, J', 'Turlure, P', 'Iacobelli, S', 'van Biezen, A', 'Schetelig, J', 'Kroger, N', 'Dreger, P']","['Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W', 'Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Eikema DJ', 'Hoek J', 'Potter M', 'Wulf G', 'Sellner L', 'Ljungman P', 'Chevallier P', 'Volin L', 'Koc Y', 'Martin S', 'Bunjes D', 'Rovira M', 'Itala-Remes M', 'Foa R', 'Deconinck E', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Cornelissen J', 'Collin M', 'Brecht A', 'Patel A', 'de Groot M', 'Remenyi P', 'Nagler A', 'Finke J', 'Turlure P', 'Iacobelli S', 'van Biezen A', 'Schetelig J', 'Kroger N', 'Dreger P']","['Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. wieslaw.jedrzejczak@wum.edu.pl.', 'Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'EBMT Statisticians, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Data Office Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Universitatsklinikum Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'CHU Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medical Park Hospitals, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', ""Univ.

In this study, we determined the effect of combined inhibition of p97 and HDAC6 activities in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. We report that treatment with p97 inhibitors induces dose-dependent apoptosis in MCL cells. The p97 inhibitor CB-5083 induces ER stress markers GRP78 and CHOP and results in the accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins. Co-treatment with CB-5083 and the HDAC6 inhibitor ACY-1215 result in marked downregulation of CDK4, Cyclin D1, and BRCA1 levels without inhibiting autophagic flux. Consequently, treatment with CB-5083 accentuates DNA damage in response to treatment with ACY-1215 resulting in enhanced accumulation of H2AX-gamma and synergistic apoptosis. Furthermore, ATM loss severely impairs phosphorylation of 53BP1 following co-treatment with CB-5083 and ACY-1215 in response to gamma irradiation. Finally, co-treatment CB-5083 and ACY-1215 results in reduced tumor volumes and improves survival in Z138C and Jeko-1 xenografts in NSG mice. These observations suggest that combined inhibition of p97 and HDAC6 abrogates resolution of proteotoxic stress and impairs DNA repair mechanisms in MCL cells.","['Vekaria, Pratikkumar H', 'Kumar, Amar', 'Subramaniam, Dharmalingam', 'Dunavin, Neil', 'Vallurupalli, Anusha', 'Schoenen, Frank', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Anant, Shrikant', 'McGuirk, Joseph P', 'Jensen, Roy A', 'Rao, Rekha']","['Vekaria PH', 'Kumar A', 'Subramaniam D', 'Dunavin N', 'Vallurupalli A', 'Schoenen F', 'Ganguly S', 'Anant S', 'McGuirk JP', 'Jensen RA', 'Rao R']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Higuchi Biosciences Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA. rraomanepalli@kumc.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kanas City, KS, USA. rraomanepalli@kumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190121,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6730676,,2019/01/22 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0355-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0355-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jul;33(7):1675-1686. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0355-y.

The present study aimed to determine the expression and effects of LIF on nucleus pulposus generation. Degenerated nucleus pulposus samples were obtained from animal models and patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. Degradation scores of intervertebral discs were evaluated via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology, and the protein expression levels of LIF were detected. Furthermore, cultured primary human degenerated nucleus pulposus cells (DNPCs) were stimulated with various concentrations of recombinant human LIF protein (rhLIF), and aggrecan and collagen type II alpha1 (COL2alpha1) protein expression levels were detected by western blotting. In addition, aggrecan expression was determined by toluidine blue staining. The effects of rhLIF on proliferation and apoptosis of DNPCs were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The results revealed that the degradation scores of intervertebral discs were significantly associated with modeling time, as determined by MRI and histology. In addition, the protein expression levels of LIF were initially increased in patients with lumbar disc herniation and in rabbit models, particularly in the 2week modeling group; however, its expression decreased with the progression of disc degeneration. Notably, LIF expression in each modeling group was higher than that in the control and 0 week modeling group. The in vitro study revealed that the protein expression levels of aggrecan and COL2alpha1 were significantly increased in response to rhLIF, in a dosedependent manner, and statistical differences were identified between the treatment groups and control group. The results of toluidine blue staining were consistent with this finding. Although rhLIF had no effect on proliferation, it inhibited apoptosis of DNPCs in a concentrationdependent manner. In conclusion, LIF was upregulated during the process of intervertebral disc degeneration, and may promote the expression of extracellular matrix components. It may also be hypothesized that LIF acts as a potential protective factor by inhibiting apoptosis of DNPCs without affecting cell proliferation.","['Xiao, Qiang', 'Zeng, Ji-Huan', 'Zhou, Hao', 'Qiu, Quan-He', 'Ke, Bo', 'Deng, Liang', 'Hu, Zhen-Ming', 'Roh, Jeffrey', 'Dai, Min']","['Xiao Q', 'Zeng JH', 'Zhou H', 'Qiu QH', 'Ke B', 'Deng L', 'Hu ZM', 'Roh J', 'Dai M']","['Jiangxi Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, P.R.

ATPbinding cassette (ABC) drug transporter proteins have been reported to be closely associated with MDR in leukemia; however, the correlation between ABC proteins and the progression of MM remains unclear. The present study used MM cell lines and clinical samples to determine the role of ABC subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) in MM via flow cytometry, reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. SP cells sorted from MM cell lines, including NCIH929 cells, via fluorescenceactivated cell sorting, exhibited CSClike phenotypes and expressed high levels of ABCG2. Expression of ABCG2 and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) signaling pathway was positively associated with the proportion of SP cells in the NCIH929 cell line. In addition, suppression of the PI3K/AKT pathway using LY294002 or rapamycin counteracted the protective effects of ABCG2 against chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Mechanistically, PI3K/AKT signaling may regulate ABCG2 expression, and ABCG2 may regulate phosphatase and tensin homolog expression via a potential negative feedback loop. Furthermore, SP cell proportion, ABCG2 expression and PI3K/AKT pathway activation were associated with disease progression in patients with MM. These findings indicated the critical roles of ABCG2 and PI3K/AKT signaling in controlling stemness of MM cells, and suggested a novel strategy for targeting ABCG2 and PI3K/AKT signaling to treat MM with MDR.","['Wang, Lei', 'Lin, Na', 'Li, Yan']","['Wang L', 'Lin N', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, P.R.

This retrospective study assessed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients diagnosed 2006 to 2011 to evaluate if monitoring/supplementing IgG would reduce febrile illnesses during maintenance chemotherapy. A subject was categorized as ""ever IgG monitored"" if they had >/=1 IgG levels checked and their risk days were stratified into not IgG monitored days and IgG monitored days. IgG monitored days were further stratified into IgG monitored with IVIG supplementation, monitored with no IVIG supplementation (IgG level >500 mg/dL) and monitored with no IVIG supplementation days (IgG level <500 mg/dL). Generalized linear mixed effects poisson models were used to compare events (febrile episode, positive blood culture, and febrile upper respiratory infection rates among these groups. In 136 patients, the febrile episode rate was higher in the ever IgG monitored cohort than the never monitored cohort (5.26 vs. 3.78 episodes/1000 d). Among monitored patients, IVIG monitoring and supplementation did not significantly impact the febrile episode, febrile upper respiratory infection, or the positive blood culture rates. These data suggest that monitoring/supplementing low IgG is not indicated for infection prophylaxis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients during maintenance chemotherapy.","['Holmes, Emily A', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Connelly, James A', 'Dulek, Daniel E', 'Zhao, Zhiguo', 'Esbenshade, Adam J']","['Holmes EA', 'Friedman DL', 'Connelly JA', 'Dulek DE', 'Zhao Z', 'Esbenshade AJ']","['Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.', 'Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center.', ""Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology."", 'Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center.', ""Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology."", 'Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.', ""Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease."", 'Vanderbilt Center for Quantitative Sciences.', 'Vanderbilt Department of Biostatistics, Nashville, TN.', 'Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center.', ""Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,PMC6993892,,2019/01/22 06:00,2020/04/18 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001415 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Aug;41(6):423-428. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001415.,,,"['K12 CA090625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 RR024977/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR000446/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1516936'],,,,20200417,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/blood/*epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*administration & dosage', 'Immunologic Factors/*administration & dosage', '*Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tennessee/epidemiology']","['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a small population of cells does not respond to TKI treatment, resulting in minimal residual disease (MRD); even the most potent TKIs fail to eradicate these cells. These MRD cells serve as a reservoir to develop resistance to therapy. Why TKI treatment is ineffective against MRD cells is not known. Growth factor signaling is implicated in supporting the survival of MRD cells during TKI treatment, but a mechanistic understanding is lacking. Recent studies demonstrated that an elevated c-Fos and Dusp1 expression as a result of convergent oncogenic and growth factor signaling in MRD cells mediate TKI resistance. The genetic and chemical inhibition of c-Fos and Dusp1 renders CML exquisitely sensitive to TKIs and cures CML in both genetic and humanized mouse models. We identified these target genes using multiple microarrays from TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells. Here, we provide methods for target validation using in vitro and in vivo mouse models. These methods can easily be applied to any target for genetic validation and therapeutic development.","['Kesarwani, Meenu', 'Kincaid, Zachary', 'Azam, Mohammad']","['Kesarwani M', 'Kincaid Z', 'Azam M']","[""Cancer Blood Disease Institute, Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Pathology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", ""Cancer Blood Disease Institute, Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Pathology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", ""Cancer Blood Disease Institute, Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Pathology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; mohammad.azam@cchmc.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20190107,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,PMC6945823,,2019/01/22 06:00,2020/01/31 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/58194 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2019 Jan 7;(143). doi: 10.3791/58194.,,,"['R01 CA155091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL114074/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1063908'],,,,20200130,IM,"['Animals', 'Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*genetics']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In phase I clinical studies at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) Brequinar induced a long-term inhibition of DHO-DH in white blood cells (WBC) and a long-term depletion of plasma uridine. These two parameters were related to severe myelosuppression, so that in Phase II studies the dose of Brequinar was decreased considerably. We further characterized the mechanism of DHO-DH enzyme inhibition while in blood samples of patients entered into Phase II studies we evaluated DHO-DH inhibition in WBC and plasma uridine depletion. With Electron Spin Resonance it was demonstrated that DHO-DH produced oxygen radical formation, which was inhibited by Brequinar. In the Phase II study depending on the dose (600 to 2000 mg/m(2)), uridine decreased to 20% (at the highest dose) or to 80-85% (at the middle dose) or did not change, which was associated with inhibition of DHO-DH (1% activity left vs 11 and 24% left). Inhibition of DHO-DH in the tumor of the latter patient was moderate as well (12% activity left). Brequinar was inactive in all tumor types evaluated possibly because of high uridine levels in the tumor. In conclusion, Brequinar was inactive against solid tumors, but DHO-DH inhibition was associated with myeloid toxicity, which may explain its potential for treatment of leukemia or inflammatory diseases.","['Peters, Godefridus J']",['Peters GJ'],"['a Department of Medical Oncology , VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , MB , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190119,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,,,2019/01/22 06:00,2019/05/17 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15257770.2018.1508692 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2018;37(12):666-678. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2018.1508692.

However, the anti-cancer activity of ibrutinib against solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains low. To improve the cytotoxicity of ibrutinib towards lung cancer, we synthesized a series of ibrutinib derivatives, of which Ibr-7 exhibited superior anti-cancer activity to ibrutinib, especially against epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type NSCLC cell lines. Ibr-7 was observed to dramatically suppress the mammalian target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/S6 signaling pathway, which is only slightly affected by ibrutinib, thus accounting for the superior anti-cancer activity of Ibr-7 towards NSCLC. Ibr-7 was shown to overcome the elevation of Mcl-1 caused by ABT-199 mono-treatment, and thus exhibited a significant synergistic effect when combined with ABT-199. In conclusion, we used a molecular substitution method to generate a novel ibrutinib derivative, termed Ibr-7, which exhibits enhanced anti-cancer activity against NSCLC cells as compared with the parental compound.","['Zhang, Bo', 'Wang, Linling', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Yan, Youyou', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Hu, Runlei', 'Zhou, Xinglu', 'Liu, Xingguo', 'Feng, Jianguo', 'Lin, Nengming']","['Zhang B', 'Wang L', 'Zhang Q', 'Yan Y', 'Jiang H', 'Hu R', 'Zhou X', 'Liu X', 'Feng J', 'Lin N']","[""Translational Medicine Research Center, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China."", ""Translational Medicine Research Center, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China."", 'Shaoxing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shaoxing, China.', ""Translational Medicine Research Center, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Translational Medicine Research Center, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", 'Hangzhou Hertz Pharmaceutical Co., China.', 'Hangzhou Hertz Pharmaceutical Co., China.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', ""Translational Medicine Research Center, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190222,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,PMC6441926,,2019/01/22 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12454 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2019 Apr;13(4):946-958. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12454.

We hypothesized that we could overcome these limitations and simultaneously enhance the therapy, by combining VSV with adoptively transferred T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells as carrier cells. We show that CD8(+) T central memory cells (CD8(+) T cm) can be efficiently loaded with VSV, they support intracellular virus production, and they can efficiently transfer VSV to tumor cells without compromising their own viability or antitumor reactivity. Loading VSV onto CD8(+) T cm not only improves the safety compared with systemic administration of naked virus, but this approach also allows for an effective delivery of virus to its tumor target, resulting in an effective combination therapy in NSG mice bearing subcutaneous human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumors. We conclude that the combination of potent tumor debulking provided by the oncolytic VSV with the added effector functions afforded by the cytotoxic immune carrier cells results in a potent and safer immunotherapeutic, which can be further developed for clinical translation.","['Melzer, Michael Karl', 'Zeitlinger, Lisa', 'Mall, Sabine', 'Steiger, Katja', 'Schmid, Roland M', 'Ebert, Oliver', 'Krackhardt, Angela', 'Altomonte, Jennifer']","['Melzer MK', 'Zeitlinger L', 'Mall S', 'Steiger K', 'Schmid RM', 'Ebert O', 'Krackhardt A', 'Altomonte J']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium of Translational Cancer Research (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium of Translational Cancer Research (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University, 81675 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181208,United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,PMC6325079,,2019/01/22 06:00,2019/01/22 06:01,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2018.12.001 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(18)30036-6 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2018 Dec 8;12:26-40. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2018.12.001. eCollection 2019 Mar 29.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'adoptive T cell therapy', 'immunotherapy', 'oncolytic virotherapy', 'vesicular stomatitis virus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma-nasal type and aggressive NK-cell leukemia can also be included in this broad spectrum. Currently, the etiology of EBV-T/NK-LPDs is unknown and no curative therapy has been established, except for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While most cases of EBV-T/NK-LPDs have been documented in specific areas of the world, they have also been documented more broadly across East Asia and Latin America.

To explore the prognostic role of miR-98 in AML, 164 AML patients with the miR-98 expression data were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and enrolled in this study. First, patients were divided into chemotherapy-only (chemotherapy) group and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) group. Each group was then divided in two groups by the median expression level of miR-98. In chemotherapy group, high miR-98 expression was associated with longer event-free survival (EFS, P = 0.003) and overall survival (OS, P = 0.004), but in allo-HSCT group, EFS and OS were not significantly different between high and low miR-98 expressers. Second, All patients were divided in two groups by the median expression level of miR-98. In low miR-98 expressers, those treated with allo-HSCT had longer EFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P < 0.001) than chemotherapy, but in high miR-98 expressers, survival was independent from treatment modalities.

The study was aimed to explore the functional roles of miR-302 cluster in CML progression. Materials and methods: Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate miR-302 cluster and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression levels. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay and human umbilical vein endothelial cell line capillary tube formation were used to determine the influence of miR-302 cluster on the growth and angiogenesis of K562 cells, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was employed to confirm the direct target interaction between miR-302 cluster and VEGFA. Results: This study demonstrated that miR-302 cluster was frequently downregulated in CML samples and cell lines and high level of miR-302 cluster was significantly associated with good prognosis of CML patients. Compared with miRNA negative control, miR-302 cluster mimics obviously suppressed cell growth, colony formation and angiogenesis. Further studies revealed that VEGFA was a direct target gene of miR-302 cluster. Moreover, overexpression of VEGFA dramatically abated the inhibition of miR-302 cluster on cell growth and angiogenesis. Conclusion: The present study, for the first time, identified miR-302 cluster as a tumor suppressor, and overexpression of miR-302 cluster inhibited growth and angiogenesis in K562 cells. miR-302 cluster may be a potential therapeutic target in CML to develop the adjuvant antiangiogenic therapy based on VEGFA.","['Cao, Jiang', 'Li, Li', 'Han, Xiao', 'Cheng, Hai', 'Chen, Wei', 'Qi, Kunming', 'Chen, Chong', 'Wu, Qingyun', 'Niu, Mingshan', 'Zeng, Lingyu', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Cao J', 'Li L', 'Han X', 'Cheng H', 'Chen W', 'Qi K', 'Chen C', 'Wu Q', 'Niu M', 'Zeng L', 'Xu K']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China, lihmd@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190108,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC6329480,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2019/01/22 06:00,2019/01/22 06:01,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S190146 [doi]', 'ott-12-433 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Jan 8;12:433-441. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S190146. eCollection 2019.,['NOTNLM'],"['VEGFA', 'angiogenesis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'miR-302']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear whether incorporation of the lncRNAs expression in the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification can further improve the prognostic prediction. METHODS: We enrolled 275 newly diagnosed non-M3 AML patients and randomly assigned them to the training (n =183) and validation cohorts (n=92). In the training cohort, we formulated a prognostic lncRNA scoring system composed of five lncRNAs with significant prognostic impact from the lncRNA expression profiling. FINDINGS: Higher lncRNA scores were significantly associated with older age and adverse gene mutations. Further, the higher-score patients had shorter overall and disease-free survival than lower-score patients, which were also confirmed in both internal and external validation cohorts (TCGA database). The multivariate analyses revealed the lncRNA score was an independent prognosticator in AML, irrespective of the risk based on the 2017 ELN classification. Moreover, in the 2017 ELN intermediate-risk subgroup, lncRNA scoring system could well dichotomize the patients into two groups with distinct prognosis. Within the ELN intermediate-risk subgroup, we found that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could provide better outcome on patients with higher lncRNA scores. Through bioinformatics approach, we identified high lncRNA scores were correlated with leukemia/hematopoietic stem cell signatures. INTERPRETATION: Incorporation of lncRNA scoring system in 2017 ELN classification can improve risk-stratification of AML patients and help clinical decision-making.

The robustness of virus removal depends on electrostatic binding between virus and oppositely charged chromatography media. However, model retrovirus Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (XMuLV) binding remains robust even when virus and media are both positively charged. We investigated this counter-intuitive phenomenon using side-by-side comparison of virus-media binding behavior of XMuLV versus parvovirus, two viruses very different in size and structure but comparable in isoelectric point. When both viruses were negatively charged, XMuLV bound to positive anion exchange media with higher strength than parvovirus. When both viruses were positively charged, XMuLV remained tightly bound to positive media but parvovirus was dissociated. Likewise, XMuLV binding to media was much stronger than parvovirus under cation exchange conditions. These findings suggest that XMuLV binding could be enhanced by localized charge distribution not possessed by parvovirus, which is an important consideration for designing chromatography processes with robust virus removal capacity.","['Cai, Kang', 'Anderson, Jennifer', 'Orchard, Joshua D', 'Afdahl, Christopher D', 'Dickson, Matthew', 'Li, Yuling']","['Cai K', 'Anderson J', 'Orchard JD', 'Afdahl CD', 'Dickson M', 'Li Y']","['AstraZeneca/MedImmune, R&D, Gaithersburg, MD, 20878, USA.

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the prognostic impact and clinical feature of SF3B1 mutations in MDS patients. The overall hazard ratio for overall survival (OS) was 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.60-1.35, P = 0.61) in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations compared to those without. Lower leukemia-free survival was associated with SF3B1 mutations. Subgroup analyses showed that Asian cohorts and Illumina HiSeq 2000 methods were significantly associated with OS. Furthermore, SF3B1 mutations were significantly correlated with a lower level of blast cells and a high level of platelet counts and bone marrow ring sideroblasts. Thus, the current meta-analysis suggests that SF3B1 mutations have no significant impact on the OS of MDS patients, and the hematologic parameters of SF3B1 mutations identify a distinct subset of MDS patients with homogeneous features.","['Tang, Yaqiong', 'Miao, Miao', 'Han, Shiyu', 'Qi, Jiaqian', 'Wang, Hong', 'Ruan, Changgeng', 'Wu, Depei', 'Han, Yue']","['Tang Y', 'Miao M', 'Han S', 'Qi J', 'Wang H', 'Ruan C', 'Wu D', 'Han Y']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.

Many studies have shown that detection of minimal residual disease (defined as 'any detectable evidence of persistent leukaemic cells during complete morphological remission') has an added value in prediction of relapse and survival, and is more than just a surrogate marker for already known risk factors in AML. As such, the behaviour of the disease during treatment might become equally or even more important to decide whether or not an upgrade of treatment (such as an allogeneic stem cell transplantation) is necessary to improve outcome. However, there are still many open issues as to what the ideal time point is to measure MRD, which threshold is clinically significant, what sample (peripheral blood or bone marrow) should be used and how we can standardize tests so that results from different labs become comparable. This review gives an overview of currently available evidence regarding technical issues, prognostic impact and MRD-directed treatment in AML.","['Moors, Ine', 'Vandepoele, Karl', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Deeren, Dries', 'Selleslag, Dominik', 'Breems, Dimitri', 'Straetmans, Nicole', 'Kerre, Tessa', 'Denys, Barbara']","['Moors I', 'Vandepoele K', 'Philippe J', 'Deeren D', 'Selleslag D', 'Breems D', 'Straetmans N', 'Kerre T', 'Denys B']","['Ghent University Hospital, Dpt.

We reviewed the rate of early infectious complications (<30days) following SQP placement in pediatric oncology patients with or without neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/mm(3)]. METHODS: Baseline characteristics and infectious complications were compared between groups using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 614 SQP were placed in 542 patients. Compared to nonneutropenic patients, those with neutropenia were more likely to have leukemia (n=74, 94% vs n=268, 50%), preoperative fever (n=17, 22% vs n=25, 5%), recent documented infection (n=15, 19% vs n=47, 9%), and were younger (81 vs 109months) (p values <0.01). After adjusting for fever and underlying-disease, there was a nonsignificant association between neutropenia and early postoperative infection (OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.82-7.18, p=0.11). Only preoperative fever was a predictor of infection (OR 6.09, 95% CI 2.08-17.81, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: SQP placement appears safe in most neutropenic patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data of 288 newly diagnosed adult acute promyelocytic leukemia patients in Hangzhou, China. The median follow-up time was 32 months (range, 6-78 months). RESULTS: The 3-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 90.83% and 91.69%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, older age (>/= 60 years) was the only independent risk factor for ED (hazard ratio [HR] = 15.057; P = .004). High white blood cell count was not a risk factor for ED (P = .055), but it was for relapse (HR = 2.7; P = .009). FLT3 mutation (HR = 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 10; P = .007) and older age (>/= 60 years) (HR = 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.4 to 11; P < .001) were prognostic factors for poorer disease-free and overall survival. Interestingly, CD15 negativity (HR = 0.23; P = .049) was a prognostic factor for relapse. The ED rate was 5.9% (17/288 patients). CONCLUSION: The perceived impact of the identification of these high-risk factors should be described in order to decide whether any modifications to treatment strategy should be entertained.","['Sun, Jianai', 'Zhu, Jingjing', 'Zhou, De', 'Zhu, Lixia', 'Yang, Xiudi', 'Xie, Mixue', 'Li, Li', 'Huang, Xianbo', 'Zhu, Mingyu', 'Zheng, Yanlong', 'Xie, Wanzhuo', 'Ye, Xiujin']","['Sun J', 'Zhu J', 'Zhou', 'Zhu L', 'Yang X', 'Xie M', 'Li L', 'Huang X', 'Zhu M', 'Zheng Y', 'Xie W', 'Ye X']","['Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.

Ph + ALL is caused by the fusion of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and the Ableson (ABL) genes, named the BCR-ABL fused gene that codes for an autonomously active tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are among the first-line therapeutic agents for the treatment of Ph + ALL. Drug resistance are the major obstacle, limiting their clinical utility. The latest third-generation TKIs, ponatinib, can tackle most abnormal BCR-ABL kinases, including the T315I mutant that is resistant to first- and second-generations TKIs such as imatinib. However, drug resistance still emerges with the novel T315L mutation and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we explored into the detailed interactions between ponatinib and BCR-ABL in the wild-type (WT), T315I, and T315L systems. The simulations revealed the significant conformational changes of ponatinib in its binding site due to the T315L mutation and the underlying structural mechanisms. Binding free energy analysis unveiled that the affinity of ponatinib to BCR-ABL decreased upon T315L mutation, which resulted in its unfavorable binding and drug resistance. Key residues responsible for the unfavored unbinding were also identified. This study elucidates the detailed mechanisms for the resistance of ponatinib in Ph + ALL triggered by the T315L mutation and will provide insights for future drug development and optimization.","['Zhang, Hao', 'He, Xinheng', 'Ni, Duan', 'Mou, Linkai', 'Chen, Xiangyu', 'Lu, Shaoyong']","['Zhang H', 'He X', 'Ni D', 'Mou L', 'Chen X', 'Lu S']","['Department of Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medicinal University, Wei fang, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Laboratory, Weifang Medicinal University, Weifang, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190205,England,J Biomol Struct Dyn,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,8404176,,,2019/01/22 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2019/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07391102.2019.1567390 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomol Struct Dyn. 2020 Jan;38(1):89-100. doi: 10.1080/07391102.2019.1567390.

In studies on head and neck areas, tumors included laryngeal, parotid gland, and salivary gland cancers. There was also a statistically significant correlation between full-mouth X-rays and salivary gland cancer, but not parotid gland cancer. Health outcomes such as leukemia, low birth weight, cataracts, and thumb carcinomas were also reported. In a few studies examining health effects related to dental X-ray exposure, possibly increased risks of meningioma and thyroid cancer were suggested.

PLR has been associated with multiple entities, including HUS and TTP, but has not previously been described in the setting of TA-TMA. Here, we describe an 18-year-old male who underwent a mismatched unrelated donor HSCT for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient was diagnosed with TA-TMA based on standard defined criteria. He presented with acute onset of blurred vision with findings of multiple white retinal patches, retinal hemorrhages, and macular edema, thought initially to be hypertensive retinopathy. However, on further evaluation using fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, the diagnosis was determined to be PLR. The patient was treated with intravitreal steroid injections (triamcinolone acetonide) with dramatic improvement of vision. The aim of this report is to make clinicians aware of PLR as a potential ocular complication associated with TA-TMA and that prompt intervention might reverse visual impairment.","['Castillo, Paul', 'Voigt, Katie', 'Crockett, Charlene', 'Stout, John Timothy', 'Krance, Robert', 'Naik, Swati']","['Castillo P', 'Voigt K', 'Crockett C', 'Stout JT', 'Krance R', 'Naik S']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190120,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,,2019/01/21 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2019/01/21 06:00'],"['2018/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13344 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2019 Mar;23(2):e13344. doi: 10.1111/petr.13344.

Because of high interest in anticancer studies involving thiosemicarbazones as new chemotherapeutic agents, a synthetic thiosemicarbazone derivative, 4-N-(2'-methoxy-styryl)-thiosemicarbazone (MTSC) was evaluated in vivo against Ehrlich carcinoma in an animal model. In vivo results demonstrated that MTSC treatment induced the survival of mice and altered significantly the body weight of the surviving mice 12 days after tumor inoculation. Treatment with 30 mg/kg of MTSC exhibited effective cytotoxic activity with T/C values of 150.49% (1 dose) and 278% (2 doses). Its interaction with human serum albumin (HSA), which plays a crucial role in the biodistribution of a wide variety of ligands, was investigated by multiple spectroscopic techniques at 296 K, 303 K, and 310 K, as well as by theoretical calculations. The interaction between HSA and MTSC occurs via ground-state association in the subdomain IIA (Sudlow's site I). The binding is moderate (Ka approximately 10(4) M(-1)), spontaneous, entropically, and enthalpically driven. Molecular docking results suggested hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions as the main binding forces. Overall, the interaction HSA:MTSC could provide therapeutic benefits, improving its cytotoxic efficacy and tolerability.","['Chaves, Otavio Augusto', 'de Castro, Isabela S', 'Goulart, Carla Marins', 'Bellieny, Myrtes S S', 'Netto-Ferreira, Jose Carlos', 'Echevarria-Lima, Juliana', 'Echevarria, Aurea']","['Chaves OA', 'de Castro IS', 'Goulart CM', 'Bellieny MSS', 'Netto-Ferreira JC', 'Echevarria-Lima J', 'Echevarria A']","['Instituto SENAI de Inovacao em Quimica Verde (ISI-QV), Rua Morais e Silva N degrees 53, Maracana, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 20271-030, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Departamento de Quimica Organica, Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ), Rodovia BR-465, Km 7, Seropedica, RJ, 23890-000, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Depto.

Studies have shown that several gp130 cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), have divergent effects on adipogenesis, lipolysis, and insulin sensitivity as well as food intake. In this review, we will summarize the present knowledge about gp130 cytokines, including IL-6, LIF, CNTF, CT-1, and OSM, in adipocyte biology and metabolic activities in conditions such as obesity, cachexia, and type 2 diabetes. It is valuable to explore the diverse actions of these gp130 cytokines on the regulation of the biological functions of adipocytes, which will provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and cachexia.","['Ma, Dufang', 'Wang, Yong', 'Zhou, Guofeng', 'Wang, Yongcheng', 'Li, Xiao']","['Ma D', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou G', 'Wang Y', 'Li X']","['Cardiology Department, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China.', 'Cardiology Department, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China.', 'First Clinical Medical College, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China.', 'First Clinical Medical College, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China.', 'Cardiology Department, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China. lixiao617@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Inflammation,Inflammation,7600105,,,2019/01/21 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10753-019-00959-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10753-019-00959-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Inflammation. 2019 Jun;42(3):790-798. doi: 10.1007/s10753-019-00959-6.,['NOTNLM'],"['adipocyte biological function', 'cardiotrophin-1', 'ciliary neurotrophic factor', 'glycoprotein 130 cytokines', 'interleukin-6 cytokine', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'oncostatin M']","['81673970/Chinese national natural science foundation', '81874449/Chinese national natural science foundation']",,,,,20191216,IM,"['Adipocytes/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cachexia/drug therapy', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/drug therapy']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (glycoprotein 130, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of signaling inhibitors that block their proliferation could reveal the proliferative mechanism of a given leukemia cell, and provide small molecule drugs for targeted therapy for AML. In this study, kinase inhibitors that block the majority of cancer signaling pathways are evaluated for their inhibition of two AML cell lines of the M5 subtypes, CTV-1 and THP-1. While THP-1 cells do not respond to any of these inhibitors, CTV-1 cells are potently inhibited by dasatinib, bosutinib, crizotinib, A-770041, and WH-4-23, all potent inhibitors for Lck, a Src family kinase. CTV-1 cells contain a kinase activity that phosphorylates an Lck-specific peptide substrate in an Lck inhibitor-sensitive manner. Furthermore, the Lck gene is over-expressed in CTV-1, and it contains four mutations, two of which are located in regions critical for Lck negative regulation, and are confirmed to activate Lck. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that mutated and overexpressed Lck is driving CTV-1 proliferation. While Lck activation and overexpression is rare in AML, this study provides a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with a similar oncogenic mechanism.","['Li, Li', 'Cui, Yixin', 'Shen, Jinyan', 'Dobson, Hannah', 'Sun, Gongqin']","['Li L', 'Cui Y', 'Shen J', 'Dobson H', 'Sun G']","['Department of Cell Biology and Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Science, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Science, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Science, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.

However, the underlying molecular mechanistic basis for the effects of Pe-A on leukemia is poorly understood. Here, we investigated that Pe-A reduced cell proliferation in three leukemia cell lines (THP-1, K562 and HL60). Importantly, Pe-A showed little cytotoxicity in primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells in a long-duration treatment. For the mechanistic research, we identified 3449 differentially expressed Pe-A-induced proteins through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with TMT label in THP-1 cells. Results showed that many identified proteins were involved in apoptosis and/or autophagy. Then, we confirmed that Pe-A induced not only apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway but also cytoprotective autophagy by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway indeed. In addition, Pe-A also arrested the cell cycle at the G0-G1 phase by regulating the expressions of checkpoint protein.

It has been shown that it is readily possible to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from several types of primary CML cells and to generate progenitors and differentiated cells with variable efficiency. Although these experiments have brought some new insights in the understanding of CML pathophysiology, the ultimate goal of generating induced leukemic stem cells (LSCs) with long-term multilineage potential has not yet been demonstrated. Experiments under way will determine whether additional signaling events are required to induce the emergence of bona fide LSCs. However, iPSC modeling offers the unique possibility to generate pluripotent cells harboring cancer-predisposing mutations using patient-derived noncancerous cells, as has been shown in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, BRCA-1 associated breast carcinomas, or RET-mutated medullary thyroid carcinomas. In these conditions, mutated iPSCs can then be used to study the mutational history that precedes the appearance of the malignant transformation and to develop novel drug-screening strategies. The ability to induce a successful differentiation program toward the tissue in which a given cancer develops or to generate tissue-specific cancer organoids in which the full oncogenic potential can be revealed remains a major challenge in the field. Similarly, in hematological malignancies, a significant hurdle remains due to the lack of adequate technology to induce the emergence of leukemic cells that resemble LSCs, which hinders our ability to study the mechanisms of therapy resistance.","['Turhan, Ali', 'Foudi, Adlen', 'Hwang, Jin Wook', 'Desterke, Christophe', 'Griscelli, Frank', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise']","['Turhan A', 'Foudi A', 'Hwang JW', 'Desterke C', 'Griscelli F', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A']","['INSERM UMR-S 935 and ESTeam Paris Sud, Universite Paris Sud, Villejuif, France; INGESTEM National iPSC Infrastructure, Villejuif, France.

Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to better analyze potential influences of GST null genotypes on individual susceptibility to leukemia. METHODS: Literature retrieve was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Embase. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Totally fifty-one studies were enrolled for analyses. Significant associations with elevated individual susceptibility to leukemia were detected for GSTM1 (p<.0001, OR=1.28, 95%CI 1.16-1.41), GSTP1 (p=.003, OR=1.22, 95%CI 1.07-1.40) and GSTT1 (p<.0001, OR=1.53, 95%CI 1.35-1.74) null genotypes in overall analyses. Further subgroup analyses by type of disease revealed that GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were all significantly associated with elevated individual susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were significantly associated with elevated individual susceptibility to acute myeloid leukemia, and GSTT1 null genotype was also significantly associated with elevated individual susceptibility to chronic leukemia. When we stratified data according to ethnicity of participants, positive results were found for all investigated variants in Caucasians and West Asians. Additionally, GSTM1 null genotype was also significantly correlated with elevated individual susceptibility to leukemia in East Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 null genotypes might serve as potential genetic biomarkers of leukemia in certain ethnicities.","['Wang, Jun', 'Wu, Depei', 'Sun, Aining']","['Wang J', 'Wu D', 'Sun A']","['Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China.

Clinical evidence of antiviral immunity decrease is the reactivation of herpes virus in the form of skin lesions. In Europe, rubella infection is common and creates lifelong persistence of IgG antibodies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine whether hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) rubella test can be used to determine antiviral immunity in CLL patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The titers of the HAI test against rubella were examined in a group of 26 healthy subjects, 7 subjects with herpes labialis infection and 56 patients with CLL, among which 9 patients were co-infected with herpes virus. RESULTS: Statistical tests have shown differences between groups and a significant decrease of the titers of the test in patients with CLL, compared with healthy persons and the herpes group compared with other persons. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a significant decrease of antiviral immunity in patients with CLL and persons with herpes-type skin lesions. Simultaneously, relying on our previous studies, we also suggest that the result of this test may be an important indicator of antiviral immunity in patients with CLL.","['Nowicka, Jadwiga', 'Milejski, Piotr', 'Urbanowicz, Iwona', 'Niewinski, Przemyslaw']","['Nowicka J', 'Milejski P', 'Urbanowicz I', 'Niewinski P']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Department of Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,,,2019/01/20 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2019/01/20 06:00'],"['2019/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/94164 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2019 May;28(5):679-682. doi: 10.17219/acem/94164.,['NOTNLM'],"['antiviral immunity', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'herpes', 'rubella HAI test']",,,,,,20190809,,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', '*Antiviral Agents', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/virology', 'Rubella/immunology', 'Rubella virus/*immunology/*isolation & purification']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we described the cancer incidence and related epidemiological features in children and adolescents to provide clues for etiological studies. METHODS: Cancer incidence stratified by age, gender, and areas was calculated using data extracted from population-based cancer registries in Henan Province, China. All cancer among children aged 0-19 years were reclassified according to category criteria of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, 3rd Edition (ICCC-3). Age-standardized rate (WSR) was calculated using Segi's world standardized population by the direct method, and it was expressed per million person-years. RESULTS: The crude cancer incidence and mortality were 87.56 and 36.32 per million person-years among children aged 0-19 years, and the WSRs slightly changed compared with crude incidence and mortality, and they were 87.36 and 35.46 per million person-years. Leukemia and central nervous system neoplasms (CNS) were the most common cancer categories both in children aged 0-14 years and in adolescents aged 15-19 years in regardless of gender and areas. Tiny difference of incidence and mortality existed in different age groups across 0-14 years; however, they were higher in adolescents aged 15-19 years than that in children aged 0-14 years. Among children aged 0-19 years, the cancer incidence and mortality were predominant in boys, and the sex ratio was 1.19; however, it was varied by diagnostic categories. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that described the cancer incidence and mortality among children aged 0-19 in Henan Province, and it would help researchers to understand the burden and epidemiological characteristics of childhood cancer, and hence suggested clues for the etiological studies.","['Chen, Qiong', 'Guo, Zhen', 'Liu, Shuzheng', 'Quan, Peiliang', 'Cao, Xiaoqin', 'Guo, Lanwei', 'Zhang, Shaokai', 'Sun, Xibin']","['Chen Q', 'Guo Z', 'Liu S', 'Quan P', 'Cao X', 'Guo L', 'Zhang S', 'Sun X']","['Department of Epidemiology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Henan Provincial Chest Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190118,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC6382923,,2019/01/20 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/01/20 06:00'],"['2018/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1952 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Feb;8(2):814-823. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1952.

This malignancy is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Novel approaches for prolonging the overall survival of patients with advanced HCC are urgently needed. The antitumor activities of adoptive cell transfer therapy (ACT), such as strategies based on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cytokine-induced killer cells, are more effective than those of traditional strategies. Currently, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy has achieved numerous breakthroughs in the treatment of hematological malignancies, including relapsed or refractory lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, this approach only provides a modest benefit in the treatment of solid tumors. The clinical results of CAR-T immunotherapy for HCC that could be obtained at present are limited. Some published studies have demonstrated that CAR-T could inhibit tumor growth and cause severe side effects.

Cartilage degeneration influences OA therapy. Here we report that hematopoietic pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor-interacting protein (HPIP) is essential for OA development. Elevated HPIP levels are found in OA patients. Col2a1-CreER(T2)/HPIP(f/f) mice exhibit obvious skeletal abnormalities compared with their HPIP(f/f) littermates. HPIP deficiency in mice protects against developing OA. Moreover, intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus carrying HPIP-specific short hairpin RNA in vivo attenuates OA histological signs. Notably, in vitro RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing profiles identify that HPIP modulates OA cartilage degeneration through transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. Mechanistically, HPIP promotes the transcription of Wnt targets by interacting with lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1). Furthermore, HPIP potentiates the transcriptional activity of LEF1 and acetylates histone H3 lysine 56 in the promoters of Wnt targets, suggesting that HPIP is an attractive target in OA regulatory network.","['Ji, Quanbo', 'Xu, Xiaojie', 'Kang, Lei', 'Xu, Yameng', 'Xiao, Jingbo', 'Goodman, Stuart B', 'Zhu, Xiang', 'Li, Wenchao', 'Liu, Juan', 'Gao, Xu', 'Yan, Zhifeng', 'Zheng, Yuxuan', 'Wang, Zheng', 'Maloney, William J', 'Ye, Qinong', 'Wang, Yan']","['Ji Q', 'Xu X', 'Kang L', 'Xu Y', 'Xiao J', 'Goodman SB', 'Zhu X', 'Li W', 'Liu J', 'Gao X', 'Yan Z', 'Zheng Y', 'Wang Z', 'Maloney WJ', 'Ye Q', 'Wang Y']","[""Department of Orthopaedics, General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, 100853, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, 100850, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, 100850, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, 100034, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025, Shanghai, China.', 'National Library of China, 100081, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, 100850, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Orthopaedics, General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, 100853, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, 100850, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA.', ""Department of Orthopaedics, General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, 100853, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, 100871, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Orthopaedics, General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, 100853, Beijing, China. zhengwang301@163.com."", 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, 94305, USA. wmaloney@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, 100850, Beijing, China. yeqn66@yahoo.com.', ""Department of Orthopaedics, General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, 100853, Beijing, China. yanwang301@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190118,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC6338798,,2019/01/20 06:00,2019/02/14 06:00,['2019/01/20 06:00'],"['2018/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-08277-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-08277-5 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Jan 18;10(1):313. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-08277-5.,,,,,,,,20190213,IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dependovirus', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Osteoarthritis/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']","['0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Pbxip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we provide evidence showing that HHT inhibits the activity of leukemia-initiating cells (Lin(-)/Sca-1(-)/c-kit(+); LICs) in a t(8;21) murine leukemia model and exerts a down-regulating effect on MYC pathway genes in human t(8;21) leukemia cells (Kasumi-1). We discovered that NF-kappaB repressing factor (NKRF) is bound directly by HHT via the second double-strand RNA-binding motif (DSRM2) domain, which is the nuclear localization signal of NKRF. A series of deletion and mutagenesis experiments mapped HHT direct binding sites to K479 and C480 amino acids in the DSRM2 domain. HHT treatment shifts NKRF from the nucleus (including nucleoli) to the cytoplasm by occupying the DSRM2 domain, strengthens the p65-NKRF interaction, and interferes with p65-p50 complex formation, thereby attenuating the transactivation activity of p65 on the MYC gene. Moreover, HHT significantly decreases the expression of KIT, a frequently mutated and/or highly expressed gene in t(8;21) AML, in concert with MYC down-regulation. Our work thus identifies a mechanism of action of HHT that is different from, but acts in concert with, the known mode of action of this compound. These results justify further clinical testing of HHT in AML.","['Chen, Xin-Jie', 'Zhang, Wei-Na', 'Chen, Bing', 'Xi, Wen-Da', 'Lu, Ying', 'Huang, Jin-Yan', 'Wang, Yue-Ying', 'Long, Jun', 'Wu,

Exercise interventions using digital activity trackers (E-DATs) may improve exercise adherence, but data are limited for patients with cancer. We conducted a systematic review examining the feasibility of E-DATs in cancer survivors and effects on activity level, body composition, objective fitness outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), self-reported symptoms, and biomarkers. Methods: We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of E-DATs in adult cancer survivors published in English between January 1, 2008, and July 27, 2017. Two authors independently reviewed article titles (n=160), removed duplicates (n=50), and reviewed the remaining 110 articles for eligibility. Results: A total of 12 RCTs met eligibility criteria, including 1,450 patients (mean age, 50-70 years) with the following cancers: breast (n=5), colon or breast (n=2), prostate (n=1), acute leukemia (n=1), or others (n=3). Duration of E-DATs ranged from 4 to 24 weeks, and the follow-up period ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with retention rates of 54% to 95%. The technology component of E-DATs included pedometers (n=8); pedometers with smartphone application (n=1), Wii Fit (n=1), heart rate monitor (n=1); and a wireless sensor with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer (n=1). Adherence by at least one measure to E-DATs was >70% in 8 of 8 RCTs. Compared with controls, E-DATs significantly improved patients' step count in 3 of 5 RCTs, activity level in 6 of 9 RCTs, and HRQoL in 7 of 9 RCTs (all P</=05), with no significant changes in biomarkers (eg, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein, c-peptide, lipid panel) in 3 RCTs. Duration of E-DAT was not significantly correlated with adherence or study retention. Conclusions: This systematic review shows that E-DATs are feasible to implement in cancer survivors. Future research should examine the optimal type, dose, and schedule of E-DATs for cancer survivors.","['Schaffer, Kerry', 'Panneerselvam, Narmadha', 'Loh, Kah Poh', 'Herrmann, Rachel', 'Kleckner, Ian R', 'Dunne, Richard Francis', 'Lin, Po-Ju', 'Heckler, Charles E', 'Gerbino, Nicholas', 'Bruckner, Lauren B', 'Storozynsky, Eugene', 'Ky, Bonnie', 'Baran, Andrea', 'Mohile, Supriya Gupta', 'Mustian, Karen Michelle', 'Fung, Chunkit']","['Schaffer K', 'Panneerselvam N', 'Loh KP', 'Herrmann R', 'Kleckner IR', 'Dunne RF', 'Lin PJ', 'Heckler CE', 'Gerbino N', 'Bruckner LB', 'Storozynsky E', 'Ky B', 'Baran A', 'Mohile SG', 'Mustian KM', 'Fung C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,PMC6519727,,2019/01/20 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/01/20 06:00'],"['2018/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['jnccn_17_1_011 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2018.7082 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2019 Jan;17(1):57-63. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2018.7082.,,,"['K07 CA221931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189961/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA037420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 AG056589/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA102618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1012396'],,,,20200622,IM,"['Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Exercise Therapy/*statistics & numerical data', '*Fitness Trackers', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*rehabilitation', 'Patient Compliance/*statistics & numerical data', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the underlying molecular dysfunctions are not well characterized. In two murine AC models, we find an upregulation of the skeletal muscle actin gene (Acta1), which is known to be a compensatory reaction to compromised heart function. Expression of this gene is elevated prior to visible morphological alterations and clinical symptoms, and persists throughout pathogenesis with an additional major rise during the chronic disease stage. We provide evidence that the increased Acta1 transcription is initiated through nuclear activation of the serum response transcription factor (SRF) by its transcriptional co-activator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 protein (MKL1, also known as MRTFA). Our data further suggest that perturbed desmosomal adhesion causes Acta1 overexpression during the early stages of the disease, which is amplified by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) release from fibrotic lesions and surrounding cardiomyocytes during later disease stages. These observations highlight a hitherto unknown molecular AC pathomechanism.","['Kant, Sebastian', 'Freytag, Benjamin', 'Herzog, Antonia', 'Reich, Anna', 'Merkel, Rudolf', 'Hoffmann, Bernd', 'Krusche, Claudia A', 'Leube, Rudolf E']","['Kant S', 'Freytag B', 'Herzog A', 'Reich A', 'Merkel R', 'Hoffmann B', 'Krusche CA', 'Leube RE']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Anatomy, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Anatomy, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Anatomy, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Anatomy, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Forschungszentrum Julich, Institute of Complex Systems, ICS-7, Biomechanics, 52428 Julich, Germany.', 'Forschungszentrum Julich, Institute of Complex Systems, ICS-7, Biomechanics, 52428 Julich, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Anatomy, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Anatomy, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany rleube@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190218,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],2019/01/20 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/01/20 06:00'],"['2016/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.199612 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.199612 [doi]']",epublish,J Cell Sci. 2019 Feb 18;132(5). pii: jcs.199612. doi: 10.1242/jcs.199612.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy', '*Desmoglein', '*Intercalated disc', '*Myocardin-related transcription factor A', '*Serum response factor']",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5519-7379'],,,20200601,IM,"['Actins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Desmoglein 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Desmosomes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myocardium/metabolism/*pathology', 'Serum Response Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']","['0 (Acta1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Desmoglein 2)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",,,['(c) 2019.

TLX1- or TLX3-deregulated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL; TLX1/3(+)) share an immature cortical phenotype and similar transcriptional signatures. However, their prognostic impacts differ, and inconsistent clinical outcome has been reported for TLX3. We therefore hypothesized that the overlapping transcriptional profiles of TLX1(+) and TLX3(+) T-ALLs would allow identification of candidate genes, which might determine their distinct clinical outcomes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared TLX1(+) and TLX3(+) adult T-ALL outcome in the successive French national LALA-94 and GRAALL-2003/2005 multicentric trials and analyzed transcriptomic data to identify differentially expressed genes. Epigenetic regulation of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and in vitro l-asparaginase sensitivity were evaluated for T-ALL cell lines and primary samples. RESULTS: We show that TLX1(+) patients expressed low levels of ASNS when compared with TLX3(+) and TLX-negative patients, due to epigenetic silencing of ASNS by both DNA methylation and a decrease of active histone marks. Promoter methylation of the ASNS gene correlated with l-asparaginase sensitivity in both T-ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Finally, ASNS promoter methylation was an independent prognostic factor for both event-free survival [HR, 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24-0.71; P = 0.001] and overall survival (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23-0.70; P = 0.02) in 160 GRAALL-2003/2005 T-ALL patients and also in an independent series of 47 LL03-treated T lymphoblastic lymphomas (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ASNS methylation status at diagnosis may allow individual adaptation of l-asparaginase dose.","['Touzart, Aurore', 'Lengline, Etienne', 'Latiri, Mehdi', 'Belhocine, Mohamed', 'Smith, Charlotte', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Spicuglia, Salvatore', 'Puthier, Denis', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Asnafi, Vahid']","['Touzart A', 'Lengline E', 'Latiri M', 'Belhocine M', 'Smith C', 'Thomas X', 'Spicuglia S', 'Puthier D', 'Pflumio F', 'Leguay T', 'Graux C', 'Chalandon Y', 'Huguet F', 'Lepretre S', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H', 'Macintyre E', 'Hunault M', 'Boissel N', 'Asnafi V']","['Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, and Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', ""Universite Paris Diderot, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, EA-3518, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, and Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Inserm, TAGC, UMR1090, Marseille, France;

It is easily provoked by periodontal probing or toothbrushing. Spontaneous gingival bleeding rarely occurs and may be the only sign of systemic bleeding problems such as thrombocytopenia, leukaemia or coagulopathy. In pregnancy, acute onset of thrombocytopenia may occur in systemic disorders such as severe pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) or the acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The diagnosis and management of such conditions may challenge physicians. It requires a systematic approach with a comprehensive history to exclude causes of gingival haemorrhage such as periodontal disease, anticoagulant therapy, maxillofacial trauma, haematological disorders or a bacterial infection. The authors describe a case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura presenting with spontaneous gingival haemorrhage in pregnancy.

To address the feasibility and efficacy of using a pediatric treatment regimen for AYA patients with newly diagnosed ALL administered by adult treatment teams, we performed a prospective study, CALGB 10403, with doses and schedule identical to those in the Children's Oncology Group study AALL0232. From 2007 to 2012, 318 patients were enrolled; 295 were eligible and evaluable for response. Median age was 24 years (range, 17-39 years). Use of the pediatric regimen was safe; overall treatment-related mortality was 3%, and there were only 2 postremission deaths. Median event-free survival (EFS) was 78.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.8 to not reached), more than double the historical control of 30 months (95% CI, 22-38 months); 3-year EFS was 59% (95% CI, 54%-65%). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Estimated 3-year OS was 73% (95% CI, 68%-78%). Pretreatment risk factors associated with worse treatment outcomes included obesity and presence of the Philadelphia-like gene expression signature.

We investigated whether PET monitoring during treatment could allow dose de-escalation by switching regimen (BEACOPPescalated to ABVD) in early responders without loss of disease control compared with standard treatment without PET monitoring. METHODS: AHL2011 is a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 study done in 90 centres across Belgium and France. Eligible patients were aged 16-60 years and had newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma, excluding nodular lymphocyte predominant subtype, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score less than 3, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, an Ann Arbor disease stage III, IV, or IIB with mediastinum-to-thorax ratio of 0.33 or greater than or extranodal localisation, and had received no previous treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. Randomisation was unmasked and done centrally by the permuted block method. Patients were randomly assigned to standard treatment (BEACOPPescalated given every 21 days for six cycles) or PET-driven treatment. All patients received two cycles of upfront BEACOPPescalated, after which PET assessment was done (PET2). In the standard treatment group, PET2 patients completed two additional cycles of BEACOPPescalated induction therapy irrespective of PET2 findings. In the PET-driven treatment group, patients with positive PET2 scans received the further two cycles of BEACOPPescalated and those with a negative PET2 scan switched to two cycles of ABVD for the remaining induction therapy. In both treatment groups, PET at the end of induction therapy was used to decide whether to continue with consolidation therapy in those with negative scans or start salvage therapy in patients with positive scans (either two cycles of ABVD in PET2-negative patients in the PET-driven arm or two cycles of BEACOPPescalated). BEACOPPescalated consisted of bleomycin 10 mg/m(2) and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 8, etoposide 200 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1-3, doxorubicin 35 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 1250 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, 100 mg/m(2) oral procarbazine on days 1-7, and 40 mg/m(2) oral prednisone on days 1-14. ABVD was given every 28 days (doxorubicin 25 mg/m(2), bleomycin 10 mg/m(2), vinblastine 6 mg/m(2), and dacarbazine 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 15). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Non-inferiority analyses were done by intention to treat and per protocol. The study had a non-inferiority margin of 10%, to show non-inferiority of PET-guided treatment versus standard care with 80% power and an alpha of 2.5% (one-sided). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01358747. FINDINGS: From May 19, 2011, to April 29, 2014, 823 patients were enrolled-413 in the standard care group and 410 in the PET-driven group. 346 (84%) of 410 patients in the PET-driven treatment group were assigned to receive ABVD and 51 (12%) to continue receiving BEACOPPescalated after PET2. With a median follow-up of 50.4 months (IQR 42.9-59.3), 5-year progression-free survival by intention to treat was 86.2%, 95% CI 81.6-89.8 in the standard treatment group versus 85.7%, 81.4-89.1 in the PET-driven treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.084, 95% CI 0.737-1.596; p=0.65) and per protocol the values were 86.7%, 95% CI 81.9-90.3 and 85.4%, 80.7-89.0, respectively (HR 1.144, 0.758-1.726; p=0.74). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were leucopenia (381 [92%] in the standard treatment group and 387 [95%] in the PET-driven treatment group), neutropenia (359 [87%] and 366 [90%]), anaemia (286 [69%] vs 114 [28%]), thrombocytopenia (271 [66%] and 163 [40%]), febrile neutropenia (145 [35%] and 93 [23%]), infections (88 [22%] and 47 [11%]), and gastrointestinal disorders (49 [11%] and 48 [11%]). Serious adverse events related to treatment were reported in 192 (47%) patients in the standard treatment group and 114 (28%) in the PET-driven treatment group, including infections (84 [20%] of 412 vs 50 [12%] of 407) and febrile neutropenia (21 [5%] vs 23 [6%]). Six (1%) patients in the standard care group died from treatment-related causes (two from septic shock, two from pneumopathy, one from heart failure, and one from acute myeloblastic leukaemia), as did two (<1%) in the PET-driven treatment group (one from septic shock and one from acute myeloblastic leukaemia). INTERPRETATION: PET after two cycles of induction BEACOPPescalated chemotherapy safely guided treatment in patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma and allowed the use of ABVD in early responders without impairing disease control and reduced toxicities. PET staging allowed accurate monitoring of treatment in this trial and could be considered as a strategy for the routine management of patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.

Adhesion plays an important role in normal haematopoiesis and in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML blasts express many of the AMs identified on normal haematopoietic precursors. Differential expression of AMs between normal haematopoietic cells and leukaemic blasts has been documented to a variable extent, likely reflecting the heterogeneity of the disease. AMs govern a variety of processes within the bone marrow (BM), such as migration, homing, and quiescence. AML blasts home to the BM, as the AM-mediated interaction with the niche protects them from chemotherapeutic agents. On the contrary, they detach from the niches and move from the BM into the peripheral blood to colonize other sites, i.e., the spleen and liver, possibly in a process that is reminiscent of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in metastatic solid cancers. The expression of AMs has a prognostic impact and there are ongoing efforts to therapeutically target adhesion in the fight against leukaemia.","['Gruszka, Alicja M', 'Valli, Debora', 'Restelli, Cecilia', 'Alcalay, Myriam']","['Gruszka AM', 'Valli D', 'Restelli C', 'Alcalay M']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Via Adamello 16, 20 139 Milan, Italy. alicja.gruszka@ieo.it.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Via Adamello 16, 20 139 Milan, Italy. debora.valli@ieo.it.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Via Adamello 16, 20 139 Milan, Italy. cecilia.restelli@ieo.it.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Via Adamello 16, 20 139 Milan, Italy. myriam.alcalay@ieo.it.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Via Festa del Perdono 7, 20 122 Milan, Italy. myriam.alcalay@ieo.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190117,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,PMC6356639,,2019/01/20 06:00,2019/01/20 06:01,['2019/01/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/20 06:01 [medline]']","['cells8010066 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8010066 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Jan 17;8(1). pii: cells8010066. doi: 10.3390/cells8010066.,['NOTNLM'],"['*EMT', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*adhesion molecules']",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5359-0281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5558-4272']",,,20191127,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The endophyte was isolated from the stem of the medicinal plant Markhamia platycalyx and identified using phylogenetics. Principle component analysis was employed to screen for the optimum growth endophyte culturing conditions and revealing that the 30-days rice culture (RC-30d) provided the highest levels of the bioactive agents. To pinpoint for active chemicals in endophyte crude extracts and successive fractions, a new application of molecular interaction network is implemented to correlate the chemical and biological profiles of the anti-trypanosome active fractions to highlight the metabolites mediating for bioactivity prior to purification trials. Multivariate data analysis (MVDA), with the aid of dereplication studies, efficiently annotated the putatively active anticancer molecules. The small-scale RC-30d fungal culture was purified using high-throughput chromatographic techniques to yield compound 1, a novel polyketide molecule though inactive. Whereas, active fractions revealed from the bioactivity guided fractionation of medium scale RC-30d culture were further purified to yield 7 metabolites, 5 of which namely cis-4-hydroxymellein, 5-hydroxymellein, diorcinol, botryoisocoumarin A and mellein, inhibited the growth of chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 at 30muM. 3-Hydroxymellein and diorcinol exhibited a respective inhibition of 56% and 97% to the sleeping sickness causing parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei. More interestingly, the anti-trypanosomal activity of A. flocculus extract appeared to be mediated by the synergistic effect of the active steroidal compounds i.e. ergosterol peroxide, ergosterol and campesterol. The isolated structures were elucidated by using 1D, 2D NMR and HR-ESIMS.","['Tawfike, Ahmed F', 'Romli, Muhammad', 'Clements, Carol', 'Abbott, Grainne', 'Young, Louise', 'Schumacher, Marc', 'Diederich, Marc', 'Farag, Mohamed', 'Edrada-Ebel, RuAngelie']","['Tawfike AF', 'Romli M', 'Clements C', 'Abbott G', 'Young L', 'Schumacher M', 'Diederich M', 'Farag M', 'Edrada-Ebel R']","['Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow G4 0RE, UK; Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo 11795, Egypt.

Relapse after allo-HCT occurs in a considerable proportion of patients and has a dismal prognosis, with still very limited curative potential. This review provides an overview of the established and evolving approaches to preventing or treating relapse of AML and MDS after allo-HCT, in the context of novel insight into the biology of relapse. Established prophylactic measures to prevent relapse include optimized conditioning and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, as well as donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for high-risk patients; novel immunomodulatory interventions and maintenance approaches are still experimental. Improved diagnostics can detect persistent or recurring disease at a molecular level, enabling early preemptive interventions. Established options include hypomethylating agents and DLI. Standard treatments for hematologic relapse include chemotherapy, cessation of immunosuppressive treatment, and DLI. Experimental approaches include molecular targeted therapies, novel immunomodulatory treatments, and second allo-HCT. For all interventions, the potential risks, including occurrence of GVHD, must be weighed against the benefits individually in each patient. Concurrently, prevention and treatment of relapse after allo-HCT remain challenging and unmet medical needs.","['Zeiser, Robert', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Bethge, Wolfgang', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Gerbitz, Armin', 'Klusmann, Jan Henning', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Rosler, Wolf', 'Sauer, Martin', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Schroeder, Thomas', 'Stelljes, Mathias', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Muller, Lutz P']","['Zeiser R', 'Beelen DW', 'Bethge W', 'Bornhauser M', 'Bug G', 'Burchert A', 'Christopeit M', 'Duyster J', 'Finke J', 'Gerbitz A', 'Klusmann JH', 'Kobbe G', 'Lubbert M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Platzbecker U', 'Rosler W', 'Sauer M', 'Schmid C', 'Schroeder T', 'Stelljes M', 'Kroger N', 'Muller LP']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.

In the present study, we found that BIBR1532, a small molecule inhibitor of human telomerase, exerted cytotoxic effects on a panel of human cancer cells spanning from solid tumors to hematologic malignancies; however, as compared with solid tumors, leukemic cells were more sensitive to this inhibitor. This was independent of molecular status of p53 in the leukemic cells. The results of a miRNA PCR array revealed that BIBR1532-induced cytotoxic effects in NB4, the most sensitive cell line, was coupled with alteration in a substantial number of cancer-related miRNAs. Interestingly, most of these miRNAs were found to act as tumor suppressors with validated targets in cell cycle or nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-mediated apoptosis. In accordance with a bioinformatics analysis, our experimental studies showed that BIBR1532-induced apoptosis is mediated, at least partly, by inhibition of NF-kappaB. Moreover, we found that the alteration in the expression of miRNAs was coupled with the alteration in the cell cycle progression. To sum up with, a straightforward interpretation of our results is that telomerase inhibition using BIBR1532 not only induced CDKN1A-mediated G1 arrest in NB4, but also resulted in a caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death mostly through suppression of NF-kappaB axis.","['Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Farshi-Paraasghari, Masoumeh', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Mansoor, Fahimeh Nemati', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi A', 'Bashash D', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Farshi-Paraasghari M', 'Momeny M', 'Mansoor FN', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Sciences and Technology, Pharmaceutical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAUPS), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

However, whether PIMs are potential therapeutic targets for treating B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) remains unclear. Therefore, here, PIM expression was detected in B-ALL patients and the effects of SMI-4a, a pan-PIM small molecule inhibitor, were investigated in B-ALL cells. METHODS: PIM1 and PIM2 expression in 26 newly diagnosed B-ALL cases was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot. B-ALL cells were treated with varied SMI-4a doses and the viability of treated cells was investigated using a cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Apoptosis and cell cycles were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was then used to explore the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. RESULTS: PIM1 and 2 were overexpressed in B-ALL patients with high HO-1 level. SMI-4a induced decreases in PIMs and HO-1 expressions and inhibited B-ALL cell viability. Treatment with SMI-4a induced apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2, upregulating Bax and other antiapoptotic proteins, and decreasing protein levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. In addition, upregulation of HO-1 alleviated decrease in p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 expression, reduced SMI-4a-induced apoptosis of B-ALL cells, and influenced B-ALL cell survival. CONCLUSIONS: PIMs were highly expressed in B-ALL patients. SMI-4a inhibited B-ALL proliferation and induced apoptosis via the HO-1-mediated JAK2/STAT3 pathway. SMI-4a might be applicable for treatment of B-ALL cells.","['Kuang, Xingyi', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Wang, Weili', 'Li, Xinyao', 'Lu, Tingting', 'Fang, Qin', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Kuang X', 'Xiong J', 'Wang W', 'Li X', 'Lu T', 'Fang Q', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Baiyun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, PR China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, PR China.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study collected data on 306 patients with hypodiploid ALL who were enrolled in the protocols of 16 cooperative study groups or institutions between 1997 and 2013. The clinical and biologic characteristics, early therapeutic responses as determined by minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment, treatment with or without MRD-stratified protocols, and allogeneic transplantation were analyzed for their impact on outcome. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.6 years, the 5-year event-free survival rate was 55.1% (95% CI, 49.3% to 61.5%), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 61.2% (95% CI, 55.5% to 67.4%) for the 272 evaluable patients. Negative MRD at the end of remission induction, high hypodiploidy with 44 chromosomes, and treatment in MRD-stratified protocols were associated with a favorable prognosis, with a 5-year event-free survival rate of 75% (95% CI, 66.0% to 85.0%), 74% (95% CI, 61.0% to 89.0%), and 62% (95% CI, 55.0% to 69.0%), respectively. After exclusion of patients with high hypodiploidy with 44 chromosomes and adjustment for waiting time to transplantation and for covariables in a Poisson model, disease-free survival did not differ significantly ( P = .16) between the 42 patients who underwent transplantation and the 186 patients who received chemotherapy only, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 59% (95% CI, 46.5% to 75.0%) versus 51.5% (95% CI, 44.7% to 59.4%), respectively. Transplantation produced no significant impact on outcome compared with chemotherapy alone, especially among the subgroup of patients who achieved a negative MRD status upon completion of remission induction. CONCLUSION: MRD-stratified treatments improved the outcome for children with hypodiploid ALL. Allogeneic transplantation did not significantly improve outcome overall and, in particular, for patients who achieved MRD-negative status after induction.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Rebora, Paola', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Cave, Helene', 'Elitzur, Sarah', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Stary, Jan', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Yeoh, Allen', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Pui CH', 'Rebora P', 'Schrappe M', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Baruchel A', 'Basso G', 'Cave H', 'Elitzur S', 'Koh K', 'Liu HC', 'Paulsson K', 'Pieters R', 'Silverman LB', 'Stary J', 'Vora A', 'Yeoh A', 'Harrison CJ', 'Valsecchi MG']","[""1 St Jude Children's Research Hospital and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN."", '2 University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', '3 University of Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', ""4 St Anna's Children's Hospital and Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", '5 Robert Debre Hospital and Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', '6 University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', '5 Robert Debre Hospital and Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', '7 Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""8 Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", '9 MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', '10 Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', '11 Princess Maxima Centre for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""12 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", '13 University Hospital Motol and Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', '14 Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', '15 National University of Singapore, Singapore.', '16 Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190118,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC7051863,,2019/01/19 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.00822 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Apr 1;37(10):770-779. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.00822.

ATL remains a challenging disease as a result of its diverse clinical features, multidrug resistance of malignant cells, frequent large tumor burden, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent opportunistic infection. In 2009, we published a consensus report to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, treatment strategies, and response criteria. The 2009 consensus report has become the standard reference for clinical trials in ATL and a guide for clinical management. Since the last consensus there has been progress in the understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of ATL and risk-adapted treatment approaches. METHODS: Reflecting these advances, ATL researchers and clinicians joined together at the 18th International Conference on Human Retrovirology-Human T-Lymphotropic Virus and Related Retroviruses-in Tokyo, Japan, March, 2017, to review evidence for current clinical practice and to update the consensus with a new focus on the subtype classification of cutaneous ATL, CNS lesions in aggressive ATL, management of elderly or transplantation-ineligible patients, and treatment strategies that incorporate up-front allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and novel agents. RESULTS: As a result of lower-quality clinical evidence, a best practice approach was adopted and consensus statements agreed on by coauthors (> 90% agreement). CONCLUSION: This expert consensus highlights the need for additional clinical trials to develop novel standard therapies for the treatment of ATL.","['Cook, Lucy B', 'Fuji, Shigeo', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Ramos, Juan Carlos', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Horwitz, Steve', 'Fields, Paul', 'Tanase, Alina', 'Bumbea, Horia', 'Cwynarski, Kate', 'Taylor, Graham', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Bittencourt, Achilea', 'Marcais, Ambroise', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Sibon, David', 'Phillips, Adrienne', 'Lunning, Matthew', 'Farid, Reza', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Choi, Ilseung', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Tokura, Yoshiki', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Cook LB', 'Fuji S', 'Hermine O', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Ramos JC', 'Ratner L', 'Horwitz S', 'Fields P', 'Tanase A', 'Bumbea H', 'Cwynarski K', 'Taylor G', 'Waldmann TA', 'Bittencourt A', 'Marcais A', 'Suarez F', 'Sibon D', 'Phillips A', 'Lunning M', 'Farid R', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Choi I', 'Ishida T', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Fukushima T', 'Uchimaru K', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Tokura Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Matsuoka M', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Watanabe T']","['1 Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '2 Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', '3 Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Japan.', '4 Necker University Hospital, Paris, France.', '5 American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', '6 University of Miami, Miami, FL.', '7 Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO.', '8 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', '9 Guys and St Thomas Hospital, Kings Health Partners, London, United Kingdom.', '10 Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', '11 Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', '12 University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '2 Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', '13 National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', '14 Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', '4 Necker University Hospital, Paris, France.', '4 Necker University Hospital, Paris, France.', '4 Necker University Hospital, Paris, France.', '15 Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', '16 University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE.', '17 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', '18 Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', '19 National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', '20 Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', '21 Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', '22 University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', '23 The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '24 Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', '25 Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', '26 Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', '27 Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', '28 Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', '23 The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190118,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC6494249,,2019/01/19 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.00501 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Mar 10;37(8):677-687. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.00501.

Objective: To estimate the incidence of various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm in breast cancer survivors, both in absolute terms and in association with the general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide cohort study conducted in France used data from the French National Health Data System, a database that contains all of French residents' health-related expenses. All French women aged 20 to 85 years with an incident breast cancer diagnosis between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, were included (n = 439 704) and followed up until hematologic malignant neoplasm occurrence, death, loss of follow-up, or December 31, 2016, whichever came first. Comparisons were made with all French women in the general population who were registered in the French general health insurance program each year from January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from January 23, 2018, to May 25, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were incident hematologic malignant neoplasm cases occurring at least 6 months after breast cancer diagnosis. The various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm considered were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/NHL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma (ALL/LL). Incidence of these various types was estimated among breast cancer survivors and compared with the incidence in women in the general population. Results: The 439704 women in the study had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 59 (50-69) years and were followed up for a median (IQR) duration of 5 (2.8-7.5) years. Overall, 3046 cases of hematologic malignant neoplasm occurred: 509 cases (16.7%) of AML (crude incidence rate [CIR] per 100 000 person-years, 24.5; 95% CI, 22.4-26.8), 832 cases (27.3%) of MDS (CIR, 40.1; 95% CI, 37.4-42.9), and 267 cases (8.8%) of MPN (CIR, 12.8; 95% CI, 11.4-14.5). Lymphoid neoplasm cases included 420 cases (13.8%) of MM (CIR, 20.3; 95% CI, 18.4-22.3), 912 cases (29.9%) of HL/NHL (CIR, 44.4; 95% CI, 41.1-50.0), and 106 cases (3.5%) of ALL/LL (CIR, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.2-6.2). Compared with the general population, breast cancer survivors had statistically significantly higher incidence of AML (standardized incidence rate ratio [SIRR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.2) and MDS (SIRR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.4-5.7) and, to a lesser extent, MM (SIRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7]) and ALL/LL (SIRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0). Conclusions and Relevance: The finding that AML and MDS still occur among breast cancer survivors today, and that ALL/LL and MM may also be of concern, merits the continuous monitoring of hematologic malignant neoplasms and the thorough investigations into their underlying mechanisms.","['Jabagi, Marie Joelle', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Goncalves, Anthony', 'Le Tri, Thien', 'Zureik, Mahmoud', 'Dray-Spira, Rosemary']","['Jabagi MJ', 'Vey N', 'Goncalves A', 'Le Tri T', 'Zureik M', 'Dray-Spira R']","['University of Paris Sud, Paris-Saclay University, Paris, France.', 'Health Product Epidemiology Department, French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, Saint-Denis, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Hematology Department, CRCM, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Medical Oncology Department, CRCM, Marseille, France.', 'Health Product Epidemiology Department, French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, Saint-Denis, France.', 'Health Product Epidemiology Department, French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, Saint-Denis, France.', 'Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University, Montigny-Le-Bretonneux, AP-HP Hopital Sainte Perine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Health Product Epidemiology Department, French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, Saint-Denis, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190104,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,PMC6484549,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/11/23 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [medline]']","['2720919 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.7147 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2019 Jan 4;2(1):e187147. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.7147.,,,,,,,,20191122,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the use of a new Spanish version of the Oropharyngeal Mucositis-Specific Quality-of-Life instrument (OMQoL) for pediatric patients. Methods: A multicentric, cross-sectional validation study was conducted to translate and adapt OMQoL from English to Spanish for its use by children with OM aged 8-16 years. Reliability was measured using Cronbach's alpha; content and construct validity, in conjunction with exploratory factor analysis. The convergent validity, with the correlations of the scales for OM defined by the WHO, OMAS (Oropharingeal Mucositis Assessment Scale) and the PedsQL-3 cancer module in Spanish. Results: One hundred and ninety-three children with mean age of 10.91 +/- 2.38 years participated in the study, out of which 101 (52.3%) were females. In this sample, 80 children (41.5%) suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 111 (57.5%) had grade 2 and 3 OM. The factorial analysis resulted in four dimensions with loads >0.40. Among the 31 items of the OMQoL, six were eliminated. Cronbach alpha of OMQoL-Spanish was 0.954. Spearman s correlations (r) with the OMS and OMAS scales were significant (with r = -0.720 and r = -0.689; p < 0.01, respectively). Moderate correlation was observed with the PedsQL-3 cancer module (r = 0.426; p < 0.01). Conclusions: OMQoL-Spanish demonstrated adequate psychometric properties, resulting in a reliable and valid instrument for measuring QoL in children with MO.","['Gutierrez-Vargas, Rosaura', 'Velasco-Rojano, Eduardo', 'Villasis-Keever, Miguel A', 'Portilla-Robertson, Javier', 'Gutierrez-Rodelo, Araceli', 'Flores-Navarro, Sonny', 'Juarez-Villegas, Luis E', 'Zapata-Tarres, Marta']","['Gutierrez-Vargas R', 'Velasco-Rojano E', 'Villasis-Keever MA', 'Portilla-Robertson J', 'Gutierrez-Rodelo A', 'Flores-Navarro S', 'Juarez-Villegas LE', 'Zapata-Tarres M']","['Programa de Maestria y Doctorado en Ciencias Medicas, Odontologicas y de la Salud, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico.

Data were abstracted from the 2013 United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results POC study; newly diagnosed AYA ALL were included. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated associations with HCT in CR1; Cox proportional hazards regression evaluated survival associations. Of 399 AYAs with ALL included, 102 (28.5%) underwent HCT in CR1. High-risk cytogenetics (odds ratio [OR] = 4.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.02-7.83) and hyper-cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (CVAD) induction (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.07-3.16) were associated with HCT in CR1. Two-year cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort were 28.3% (95% CI = 23.4-33.4), 69.3% (95% CI = 63.6-74.3%), and 84.1% (95% CI = 79.7-87.5), respectively.

30657401,NLM,MEDLINE,20191207,2473-4276 (Electronic) 2473-4276 (Linking),1,,2017 Nov,Overcoming the Straw Man Effect in Oncology: Visualization and Ranking of Chemotherapy Regimens Using an Information Theoretic Approach.,1-9,10.1200/CCI.17.00079 [doi],"PURPOSE: Despite the plethora of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, most cancer treatment recommendations are formulated by experts. Alternatively, network meta-analysis (NMA) is one method of analyzing multiple indirect treatment comparisons. However, NMA does not account for mixed end points or temporality. Previously, we described a prototype information theoretical approach for the construction of ranked chemotherapy treatment regimen networks. Here, we propose modifications to overcome an apparent straw man effect, where the most studied regimens were the most negatively valued. METHODS: RCTs from two scenarios-upfront treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma-were assembled into ranked networks using an automated algorithm based on effect sizes, statistical significance, surrogacy of end points, and time since RCT publication. Vertex and edge color, transparency, and size were used to visually analyze the network. This analysis led to the additional incorporation of value propagation. RESULTS: A total of 18 regimens with 42 connections (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and 28 regimens with 25 connections (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) were analyzed. An initial negative correlation between vertex value and size was ameliorated after value propagation, although not eliminated. Updated rankings were in close agreement with published guidelines and NMAs. CONCLUSION: Straw man effects can distort the comparative efficacy of newer regimens at the expense of older regimens, which are often cheaper or less toxic. Using an automated method, we ameliorated this effect and produced rankings consistent with common practice and published guidelines in two distinct cancer settings. These findings are likely to be generalizable and suggest a new means of ranking efficacy in cancer trials.","['Warner, Jeremy L', 'Yang, Peter C', 'Alterovitz, Gil']","['Warner JL', 'Yang PC', 'Alterovitz G']","['Jeremy L.

We used pharmacoepidemiologic methods to evaluate the survival of patients with cancer who received statins alone or in ostensibly synergistic drug combinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer who were diagnosed from 2010 to 2013 were identified in a large health care claims database. The rate of all-cause death up to 1 year after diagnosis was compared by Cox proportional hazard regression. Sensitivity analyses included age stratification, statin type and intensity, and comparison with or without bisphosphonates and dipyridamole. RESULTS: Among 312,907 identified patients with cancer, treatment groups included statin users (n = 65,440), nonstatin users who received medications that block cholesterol absorption (n = 9,289), and nonusers (n = 226,007). Statin use before diagnosis was associated with improved overall survival compared with no treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.91) and specifically in patients with leukemia, lung, or renal cancers. Nonstatin users had increased overall survival compared with no treatment (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.85); when stratified, this difference held true only for pancreatic cancer and leukemia. No differences were observed between statin and nonstatin groups. Bisphosphonate use alone had no effect (n = 4,528), but patients who used both statins and bisphosphonates (n = 4,090) had increased survival compared with no treatment (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.81). The effect of the combination of dipyridamole and statin use (n = 651) was not significant compared with no treatment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the combination of statins with drugs that affect isoprenylation, such as bisphosphonates, improves survival in patients with cancer. Consideration of pathway-specific pharmacology allows for hypotheses testing with the pharmacoepidemiologic approach. Prospective evaluation of these findings warrants clinical investigation and preclinical mechanistic studies.","['El-Refai, Sherif M', 'Brown, Joshua D', 'Arnold, Susanne M', 'Black, Esther P', 'Leggas, Markos', 'Talbert, Jeffery C']","['El-Refai SM', 'Brown JD', 'Arnold SM', 'Black EP', 'Leggas M', 'Talbert JC']","['Sherif M.

This signaling pathway is of utmost importance, owing to its ability to fuel tissue repair and regeneration of stem cell activity in diverse organs. The human adult stem cells including hematopoietic cells, intestinal cells, mammary and mesenchymal cells rely on the manifold effects of Wnt pathway. The consequences of any dysfunction or manipulation in the Wnt genes or Wnt pathway components result in specific developmental defects and may even lead to cancer, as it is often implicated in stem cell control. It is absolutely essential to possess a comprehensive understanding of the inhibition and/ or stimulation of the Wnt signaling pathway which in turn is implicated in determining the fate of the stem cells. RESULTS: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the studies associated with the implementation of small molecule compounds in key areas of stem cell biology including regeneration differentiation, proliferation. In support of this statement, small molecules have unfolded as imperative tools to selectively activate and inhibit specific developmental signaling pathways involving the less complex mechanism of action. These compounds have been reported to modulate the core molecular mechanisms by which the stem cells regenerate and differentiate. CONCLUSION: This review aims to provide an overview of the prevalent trends in the small molecules based regulation of stem cell fate via targeting the Wnt signaling pathway.","['Banerjee, Antara', 'Jothimani, Ganesan', 'Prasad, Suhanya Veronica', 'Marotta, Francesco', 'Pathak, Surajit']","['Banerjee A', 'Jothimani G', 'Prasad SV', 'Marotta F', 'Pathak S']","['Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Kelambakkam 603 103, India.', 'Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Kelambakkam 603 103, India.', 'Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Kelambakkam 603 103, India.', 'ReGenera R&D International for Aging Intervention, Milano, Italy and San Babila Clinic, Healthy Aging Unit by Genomics and Biotechnology, Milano, Italy.', 'Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Kelambakkam 603 103, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",101269157,,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/08/29 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['EMIDDT-EPUB-95882 [pii]', '10.2174/1871530319666190118103907 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets. 2019;19(3):233-246. doi: 10.2174/1871530319666190118103907.,['NOTNLM'],"['DCA', 'Wnt activators', 'Wnt inhibitors', 'Wnt ligands', 'XAV939', 'alzheimer', 'leukemia', 'progenitor cells', 'pyrvinium', 'quercetin.']",,,,,,20190828,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nervous System Diseases/pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology']",,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the utility of FDG-PET/CT at the time of relapsed/refractory disease in pediatric patients with leukemia. METHODS: Medical records of 28 children with suspected leukemia progression or recurrence during/after chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) were retrospectively reviewed to determine the utility of FDG-PET/CT. RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 28 patients have documented abnormal imaging findings during clinical follow-up, while six had were interpreted as not demonstrating signal consistent with active leukemia. Of the 22 patients with abnormal FDG-PET/CT studies 14 were found to have FDG-PET/CT reported as consistent with active leukemia and increased leukemia blasts on bone marrow biopsy. Regarding the eight patients without positive FDG-PET/CT and proven leukemia relapse, four had discordant findings on FDG-PET/CT and biopsy, and four had FDG-PET/CT reported as infection. Mean maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were significantly higher among patients whose FDG-PET/CT findings were positive for leukemia as opposed to infectious disease (p < .05). Mean SUVmax was also significantly higher among patients with multifocal lesions on FDG-PET/CT than among those with diffuse lesions (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that FDG-PET/CT may be a complementary imaging modality that could be combined with bone marrow examination to improve detection of subtle leukemic infiltration in children with suspected leukemia progression or recurrence after chemotherapy or allo-SCT.","['Kaya, Zuhre', 'Akdemir, Ozgur Umit', 'Atay, Ozlem Lutfiye', 'Akyurek, Nalan', 'Pinarli, Faruk Guclu', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Kocak, Ulker']","['Kaya Z', 'Akdemir OU', 'Atay OL', 'Akyurek N', 'Pinarli FG', 'Yenicesu I', 'Kocak U']","['a Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology Unit , Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'b Departments of Nuclear Medicine , Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'b Departments of Nuclear Medicine , Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Department of Pathology , Gazi University Faculty of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'd Department of Pediatric Oncology , Gazi University Faculty of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology Unit , Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology Unit , Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190118,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/04/05 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2018.1557306 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Oct - Nov;35(7-8):393-406. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2018.1557306.

It is responsible for proper segregation of chromatides to daughter cells during mitosis as well as DNA double strand breaks repair by homologous recombination (HR). Genetic alterations of BRCA1 gene are cancer predisposition markers. Mutations or epigenetic alterations have been noticed in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, significantly increasing risk of cancer development. Such gene alterations are not connected with leukemias. Importantly, BRCA1 deficiency is a factor which makes patients susceptible for personalized therapy with PARP1 inhibitors, which is based on the phenomenon called synthetic lethality. In this review we present our discoveries of novel mechanism leading to BRCA1 deficiency in leukemia, which is not connected with BRCA1 gene mutations or epigenetic alterations, but with attenuated translation of BRCA1 protein linked to the cellular stress response and controlled by RNA binding proteins. Moreover, we found that some treatments or genetic alterations in leukemias might also result in BRCA1 deficits. Our studies provide evidence that PARP1 inhibitors should be considered as efficient treatment in BRCA1-deficient leukemias, leading to elimination of cancer cells, including stem and progenitor cells. Finally we propose a strategy to select leukemia patients which might be sensitive to therapy with PARP1 inhibitors.","['Piwocka, Katarzyna', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka, Paulina', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Piwocka K', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka P', 'Skorski T']","['Instytut Biologii Doswiadczalnej PAN im.

Patient outcomes are heterogeneous and can be difficult to predict with current prognostic markers. Here, we used a quantitative label-free proteomic technique to ascertain differences in the B-cell proteome from healthy donors and CLL patients with either mutated (M-CLL) or unmutated (UM-CLL) IGHV to identify new prognostic markers. In peripheral B-CLL cells, 349 (22%) proteins were differentially expressed between normal B cells and B-CLL cells and 189 (12%) were differentially expressed between M-CLL and UM-CLL. We also examined the proteome of proliferating CLL cells in the lymph nodes, and identified 76 (~8%) differentially expressed proteins between healthy and CLL lymph nodes. B-CLL cells show over-expression of proteins involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. A comprehensive lipidomic analysis highlighted large differences in glycolipids and sphingolipids. A shift was observed from the pro-apoptotic lipid ceramide towards the anti-apoptotic/chemoresistant lipid, glucosylceramide, which was more evident in patients with aggressive disease (UM-CLL). This study details a novel quantitative proteomic technique applied for the first time to primary patient samples in CLL and highlights that primary CLL lymphocytes display markers of a metabolic shift towards lipid synthesis and breakdown.","['Thurgood, Lauren A', 'Dwyer, Eveline S', 'Lower, Karen M', 'Chataway, Tim K', 'Kuss, Bryone J']","['Thurgood LA', 'Dwyer ES', 'Lower KM', 'Chataway TK', 'Kuss BJ']","['Discipline Molecular Medicine and Pathology, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Discipline Molecular Medicine and Pathology, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Discipline Molecular Medicine and Pathology, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Flinders Proteomic Facility, Department of Human Physiology, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Discipline Molecular Medicine and Pathology, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Haematology, Molecular Medicine and Pathology, SA Pathology, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190117,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,,2019/01/19 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15751 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Apr;185(1):65-78. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15751.

However, the expression of these receptors in samples from patients with leukemia remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the expression of M3-mAChR and alpha7-nAChR in the bone marrow or peripheral blood of 51 patients with leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=33), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n=13), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n=5). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were also isolated from healthy subjects (n=5) for comparison. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the protein expression profiles, and a pattern of decreased alpha7-nAChR levels in patients with leukemia was observed. Among the leukemia types, the lowest expression of alpha7-nAChR and M3-mAChR were identified in patients with T-cell ALL/lymphoma (T-ALL). CML exhibited the highest level of M3-mAChR, which was significantly different from APL and AML-M4, yet not from healthy subjects (P<0.05). Therefore, different expression profiles of alpha7-nACR and M3-mAChR were detected amongst the leukemia types. Collectively, the present study supports the potential role of cholinergic signaling in mediating leukemogenesis. However, further studies in larger cohorts are required to validate these findings.","['Suriyo, Tawit', 'Chotirat, Sadudee', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U', 'Chaiyot, Karnjana', 'Promsuwicha, Orathai', 'Satayavivad, Jutamaad']","['Suriyo T', 'Chotirat S', 'Auewarakul CU', 'Chaiyot K', 'Promsuwicha O', 'Satayavivad J']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.', 'Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, Office of Higher Education Commission, Ministry of Education, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacology, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Public Health, HRH Princess Chulabhorn College of Medical Science, Chulabhorn Royal Academy, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacology, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacology, Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.', 'Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, Office of Higher Education Commission, Ministry of Education, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Environmental Toxicology Program, Chulabhorn Graduate Institute, Chulabhorn Royal Academy, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181105,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC6313006,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/01/19 06:01,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2018.9663 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-9663 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2019 Jan;17(1):1357-1362. doi: 10.3892/ol.2018.9663.

Serum concentrations of Gal-1, -3 and -9 and Gal-3BP were measured in 48 patients with CLL and 30 control patients, using multiplex bead arrays. In patients with CLL, galectin concentrations were assessed prior to, during and following treatment. In patients with CLL who were untreated, galectin concentrations were measured twice with a 6-month interval. The serum level of Gal-9 was significantly increased (P<0.0001) in patients with CLL compared with the control group, and was associated with the clinical stage according to Binet classification, as well as poor cytogenetic and serum CLL prognostic factors. In addition, patients with CLL, who exhibited treatment failure, exhibited higher concentrations of Gal-9 (P=0.06) and Gal-3BP (P=0.009) at the end of the treatment when compared with patients under complete remission or stabilization of the disease. The serum level of Gal-3 was significantly decreased (P=0.012) in patients with CLL compared with the control group.

As one of the most important components of the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM), bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are critical in the development of leukemia and essential in the regulation of hematopoiesis. However, little is known regarding the alterations of BMSCs in CML. The current study performed Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony-forming unit fibroblast assays to evaluate the proliferative ability of BMSCs. The percentage of senescent BMSCs was evaluated by a senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining assay. Subsequently, a long-term culture-initiating cell assay was designed to explore the HC-supporting capacity of the BMSCs. Furthermore, cytogenetics were detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The current results revealed that CML-BMSCs exhibited decreased cell proliferation and impaired HC-support capacity, as well as increased susceptibility to senescence. No chromosomal aberrations, including the absence of the Ph chromosome, were noted in all CML-BMSCs. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated functional inhibition of CML-BMSCs; however, no signs of chromosomal aberrations were observed, thereby providing insight into the changes occurring in the CML-BMM.","['Xie, Jieqiong', 'Chen, Jiadi', 'Wang, Bin', 'He, Xuchun', 'Huang, Huifang']","['Xie J', 'Chen J', 'Wang B', 'He X', 'Huang H']","['Central Laboratory, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

However, a number of patients relapse or fail to respond to rituximab. To further understand the cause of this, polymorphisms of FcgammaRIIIa were initially detected in healthy volunteers. Subsequently, the rituximab-dependent natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity of different FcgammaRIIIa genotypes was assessed by a cytotoxicity assay in vitro. Ultimately, the effect of human serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G and complement on rituximab-dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro. It was revealed that FcgammaRIIIa polymorphisms were associated with the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK cells. In addition, the ADCC of NK cells with FcgammaRIIIa-158 V/V was increased compared with that of FcgammaRIIIa-158 V/F. The serum IgG and rituximab Fc segment was able to bind competitively with NK cell FcgammaRIIIa. It was observed that serum IgG inhibited, whereas complement enhanced rituximab-induced NK-cell mediated ADCC. Therefore, various agents administered synchronously with rituximab may modulate the efficacy of this agent and ultimately its toxicity against tumor cells.","['Li, Yang', 'Huang, Ke', 'Liu, Ling', 'Qu, Yuhua', 'Huang, Yan', 'Wu, Yanfeng', 'Wei, Jing']","['Li Y', 'Huang K', 'Liu L', 'Qu Y', 'Huang Y', 'Wu Y', 'Wei J']","['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510120, P.R.

The transfection efficiency of fluorescein amidite (FAM)-small interfering RNA (siRNA) was determined using flow cytometry, and the protein expression levels of LPXN, phosphorylated (p)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and p-extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were detected by western blot analysis. Proliferation was determined using the cell counting kit-8 reagent and cellular transmembrane invasion ability was determined using a Transwell chamber system. The gelatinase levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in the cell culture supernatant were also analyzed by gelatin zymography. In SHI-1 cells, the optimal transfection conditions of siRNA were a cell density of 4x10(5) cells/ml and a ratio of siRNA/Lipofectamine((R)) 2000 of 200 pmol/1 microl. The highest transfection efficiency of FAM-siRNA was 74.5%. In the present study, L2-siRNA was selected to effectively decrease the expression of LPXN. Following downregulation of LPXN expression by L2-siRNA, proliferation inhibition rates increased to 27.043+/-2.051 and cell transmembrane invasion rates decreased to 25.270+/-2.145 (P<0.05). The results of the western blot analysis and the gelatin zymography indicated that downregulation of LPXN expression increased the expression of p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK, and attenuated the secretion levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9. However, downregulation of LPXN expression had no effect on p-ERK expression in SHI-1 cells. The results of the present study indicated that downregulation of LPXN expression decreased the malignant proliferation and transmembrane invasion of SHI-1 cells by activating JNK and p38 MAPK, and inhibiting MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion.","['Zhu, Guo-Hua', 'Dai, Hai-Ping', 'Shen, Qun', 'Zhang, Qi']","['Zhu GH', 'Dai HP', 'Shen Q', 'Zhang Q']","['First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210023, P.R.

Constitutional genetic variation is likely to impact on t-MN risk. We aimed to evaluate if polymorphisms in the p53 pathway can be useful for predicting t-MN susceptibility. First, an association study revealed that the Pro variant of the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the G allele of the MDM2 SNP309 were associated with t-MN risk. The Arg variant of TP53 is more efficient at inducing apoptosis, whereas the Pro variant is a more potent inductor of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. As regards MDM2 SNP309, the G allele is associated with attenuation of the p53 apoptotic response. Second, to evaluate the biological effect of the TP53 polymorphism, we established Jurkat isogenic cell lines expressing p53Arg or p53Pro. Jurkat p53Arg cells presented higher DNA damage and higher apoptotic potential than p53Pro cells, after treatment with chemotherapy agents. Only p53Pro cells presented t(15;17) translocation and del(5q). We suggest that failure to repair DNA lesions in p53Arg cells would lead them to apoptosis, whereas some p53Pro cells, prone to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, could undergo misrepair, generating chromosomal abnormalities typical of t-MN.","['Cabezas, Maria', 'Garcia-Quevedo, Lydia', 'Alonso, Cintia', 'Manubens, Marta', 'Alvarez, Yolanda', 'Barquinero, Joan Francesc', 'Ramon Y Cajal, Santiago', 'Ortega, Margarita', 'Blanco, Adoracion', 'Caballin, Maria Rosa', 'Armengol, Gemma']","['Cabezas M', 'Garcia-Quevedo L', 'Alonso C', 'Manubens M', 'Alvarez Y', 'Barquinero JF', 'Ramon Y Cajal S', 'Ortega M', 'Blanco A', 'Caballin MR', 'Armengol G']","['Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.', ""Department of Pathology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, 08035, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", 'Spanish Biomedical Research Network Centre in Oncology (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, 08035, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, 08035, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", 'Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Unit of Biological Anthropology, Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biosciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain. gemma.armengol@uab.cat.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190117,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC6336808,,2019/01/19 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-36931-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-36931-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jan 17;9(1):150. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-36931-x.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3867-1390', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2345-1106']",,,20200511,IM,"['Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']","['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed targeted NGS on 112 patients with AML, and 80 with MDS, who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The most common mutations in AML were TET2 (14.7%), FLT3 (12.9%), DNMT3A (12.1%), and RUNX1 (7.8%). Complex cytogenetics (HR 2.82, P = .017) and disease status (<CR) (HR 2.58, P < .001) was significantly associated with worse RFS. No individual mutation, nor variant allelic frequency (VAF), was found to be prognostic, except mutations in the RNA-splicing pathway, (HR 2.09, P = .023).

A Cox model was fitted to detect clinical and transplant-related variables prognostic of outcome. Then, cross-validation was performed to evaluate the validity and consistency of the model. Seven independent risk factors for survival were identified: age >/=50 years, matched unrelated donor, Karnofsky Performance Status <90%, very poor cytogenetics or monosomal karyotype, positive cytomegalovirus status of the recipient, blood blasts >1%, and platelet count </=50 x 10(9)/L prior to transplantation. Incorporating these factors into a four-level risk score yielded hazard ratios for death, with low-risk (score of 0-1) as reference, of 2.02 (95% CI: 1.41-2.90) for the intermediate-risk group (score of 2-3), 3.49 (95% CI: 2.45-4.97) for the high-risk group (score of 4-5), and 5.90 (95% CI: 4.01-8.67) for the very high-risk group (score of >5). The score was predictive of survival, relapse-free survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality (P<0.001, respectively). Cross-validation yielded significant and reproducible improvement in prognostic ability with C-statistics being 0.609 (95% CI: 0.588-0.629) versus 0.555 for the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo registry and 0.579 for the Center for Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry. Prediction was even further augmented after applying a nomogram using age and platelets as continuous variables showing C-statistics of 0.628 (95% CI: 0.616-0.637). In conclusion, compared to existing prognostic systems, this proposed transplant-specific risk score offers improved performance with respect to post-transplant risk stratification in myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Gagelmann, Nico', 'Eikema, Diderik-Jan', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth', 'Mufti, Ghulam', 'Knelange, Nina Simone', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Friis, Lone S', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Meijer, Ellen', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Lopez-Corral, Lucia', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Robin, Marie', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Gagelmann N', 'Eikema DJ', 'Stelljes M', 'Beelen D', 'de Wreede L', 'Mufti G', 'Knelange NS', 'Niederwieser D', 'Friis LS', 'Ehninger G', 'Nagler A', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Meijer E', 'Ljungman P', 'Maertens J', 'Kanz L', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Brecht A', 'Craddock C', 'Finke J', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Bernasconi P', 'Chevallier P', 'Sierra J', 'Robin M', 'Kroger N']","['University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'EBMT Statistics, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'University of Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital of Essen, Germany.', 'EBMT Statistics, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'GKT School of Medicine, London, UK.', 'EBMT Data Office, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'University Hospital Leipzig, Germany.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Universitatsklinikum Dresden, Germany.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'CHU de Lille, LIRIC, INSERM U995, Universite Lille2, France.', 'VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Universitat Tubingen, Germany.', 'Hospital Clinico, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Deutsche Klinik fur Diagnostik, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Birmingham, UK.', 'University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'CHU Nantes, France.', 'Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190117,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC6518902,,2019/01/19 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.200808 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.200808 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 May;104(5):929-936. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.200808.

The proapoptotic protein, BIM is pivotal in the induction of cell death by both selumetinib and glucocorticoids, suggesting the potential for synergy. Thus, combination indices for dexamethasone and selumetinib were determined in RAS pathway-mutated acute lymphoblastic leukemia primagraft cells in vitro and were indicative of strong synergism (combination index <0.2; n=5). Associated pharmacodynamic assays were consistent with the hypothesis that the drug combination enhanced BIM upregulation over that achieved by a single drug alone. Dosing of dexamethasone and selumetinib singly and in combination in mice engrafted with primary-derived RAS pathway-mutated leukemia cells resulted in a marked reduction in spleen size which was significantly greater with the drug combination. Assessment of the central nervous system leukemia burden showed a significant reduction in the drug-treated mice, with no detectable leukemia in those treated with the drug combination. These data suggest that a selumetinib-dexamethasone combination may be highly effective in RAS pathway-mutated acute lymphoblastic leukemia. An international phase I/II clinical trial of dexamethasone and selumetinib (Seludex trial) is underway in children with multiply relapsed/refractory disease.","['Matheson, Elizabeth C', 'Thomas, Huw', 'Case, Marian', 'Blair, Helen', 'Jackson, Rosanna K', 'Masic, Dino', 'Veal, Gareth', 'Halsey, Chris', 'Newell, David R', 'Vormoor, Josef', 'Irving, Julie A E']","['Matheson EC', 'Thomas H', 'Case M', 'Blair H', 'Jackson RK', 'Masic D', 'Veal G', 'Halsey C', 'Newell DR', 'Vormoor J', 'Irving JAE']","['Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.', ""Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."", 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne j.a.e.irving@ncl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190117,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC6717586,,2019/01/19 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.185975 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.185975 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Sep;104(9):1804-1811. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.185975.

We performed comprehensive genetic and clinico-biological analyses of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with DNMT3A mutations treated during the GRAALL-2003 and -2005 studies. Eighteen of 198 cases (9.1%) had DNMT3A alterations. Two patients also had DNMT3A mutations in non-leukemic cell DNA, providing the first potential evidence of age-related clonal hematopoiesis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DNMT3A mutation was associated with older age (median 43.9 years vs 29.4 years, P<0.001), immature T-cell receptor genotype (53.3% vs 24.4%, P=0.016) and lower remission rates (72.2% mutated vs 94.4% non-mutated, P=0.006). DNMT3A alterations were significantly associated with worse clinical outcome, with higher cumulative incidence of relapse (HR 2.33, 95% CI: 1.05-5.16, P=0.037) and markedly poorer event-free survival (HR 3.22, 95% CI: 1.81-5.72, P<0.001) and overall survival (HR 2.91, 95% CI: 1.56-5.43, P=0.001). Adjusting for age as a covariate, or restricting the analysis to patients over 40 years, who account for almost 90% of DNMT3A-mutated cases, did not modify these observations. In multivariate analysis using the risk factors that were used to stratify treatment during the GRAALL studies, DNMT3A mutation was significantly associated with shorter event-free survival (HR 2.33, 95% CI: 1.06 - 4.04, P=0.02). Altogether, these results identify DNMT3A genotype as a predictor of aggressive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia biology.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown tremendous success in treating relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but this has not yet translated to treating solid tumors. This is partially due to a paucity of differentially expressed cell surface molecules on solid tumors that can be safely targeted. Here, we present B7-H3 (CD276) as a putative target for CAR T-cell therapy of pediatric solid tumors, including those arising in the central nervous system. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a novel B7-H3 CAR whose binder is derived from a mAb that has been shown to preferentially bind tumor tissues and has been safely used in humans in early-phase clinical trials. We tested B7-H3 CAR T cells in a variety of pediatric cancer models. RESULTS: B7-H3 CAR T cells mediate significant antitumor activity in vivo, causing regression of established solid tumors in xenograft models including osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma. We demonstrate that B7-H3 CAR T-cell efficacy is largely dependent upon high surface target antigen density on tumor tissues and that activity is greatly diminished against target cells that express low levels of antigen, thus providing a possible therapeutic window despite low-level normal tissue expression of B7-H3. CONCLUSIONS: B7-H3 CAR T cells could represent an exciting therapeutic option for patients with certain lethal relapsed or refractory pediatric malignancies, and should be tested in carefully designed clinical trials.","['Majzner, Robbie G', 'Theruvath, Johanna L', 'Nellan, Anandani', 'Heitzeneder, Sabine', 'Cui, Yongzhi', 'Mount, Christopher W', 'Rietberg, Skyler P', 'Linde, Miles H', 'Xu, Peng',

CALR is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein that normally binds misfolded proteins in the ER and prevents their export to the Golgi and had never previously been reported mutated in cancer or to be associated with hematologic disorders. Further investigation determined that mutated CALR is able to achieve oncogenic transformation primarily through constitutive activation of the MPL-JAK-STAT signaling axis. Here we review our current understanding of the role of CALR mutations in MPN pathogenesis and how these insights can lead to innovative therapeutics approaches.","['Merlinsky, Tiffany R', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Pronier, Elodie']","['Merlinsky TR', 'Levine RL', 'Pronier E']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York. leviner@mskcc.org.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190117,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC6522317,,2019/01/19 06:00,2020/07/17 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-3777 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3777 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 May 15;25(10):2956-2962. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3777.

We observed that polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from FcgammaRIIIB wild-type (WT) individuals or the null donor were more effectively activated by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cell targets opsonized with glycoengineered anti-CD20 antibodies compared with fully core-fucosylated anti-CD20 antibodies, suggesting the presence and role of FcgammaRIIIA (CD16A) on PMNs. Indeed, we demonstrated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis that PMNs from FcgammaRIIIB WT donors and the null individual express low levels of FcgammaRIIIA on their surfaces. FcgammaRIIIA is a functional and activating molecule on these cells, because anti-CD16 F(ab')2 antibodies alone were able to activate highly purified PMNs from the FcgammaRIIIB-null donor. Use of blocking anti-CD16 and anti-CD32 antibodies showed that FcgammaRIIIA is also a major mediator of phagocytosis of CD20-opsonized beads by FcgammaRIIIB WT and null PMNs. In contrast, trogocytosis of antibody-opsonized CLL B cells by PMNs was mediated primarily by FcgammaRIIIB in WT PMNs and by FcgammaRIIA in null PMNs. We conclude that FcgammaRIIIA is an important player in PMN functions, whereas FcgammaRIIIB is dispensable for activation and phagocytosis. We discuss the clinical implications of these findings.","['Golay, Josee', 'Valgardsdottir, Rut', 'Musaraj, Gerta', 'Giupponi, Damiano', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Introna, Martino']","['Golay J', 'Valgardsdottir R', 'Musaraj G', 'Giupponi D', 'Spinelli O', 'Introna M']","['Center of Cellular Therapy ""G.

BACH2 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in immune-mediated homeostasis by tightly regulating PRDM1 expression in both B-cells and T-cells. BACH2 gene expression is highly sensitive to DNA damage in aged mice. This concept led us to investigate the variation in BACH2 and also PRDM1 expression in major lymphocyte subsets with age. METHODS: Lymphocyte subsets from 60 healthy donors, aged from 20 to 90 years, and 41 untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were studied. BACH2 and PRDM1 gene expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. BACH2 gene expression was correlated with its protein expression. Lymphocyte apoptosis was evaluated after intracellular oxidative stress-inducing etoposide treatment of T and B cells. RESULTS: Our analysis shows BACH2 mRNA downregulation with age in healthy donor CD4+, CD8+ T-cells and CD19+ B-cells. Decreased BACH2 expression was also correlated with an age-related reduction in CD8 + CD28+ T-cells. We found a strong correlation between age-related BACH2 downregulation and decreased CD4+ T-cell and CD19+ B-cell apoptosis. PRDM1, as expected, was significantly upregulated in CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and CD19+ B-cells, and inversely correlated with BACH2. A comparison of untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with age-matched healthy donors reveals that BACH2 mRNA expression was further reduced in CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and leukemic-B cells. PRDM1 gene expression was consequently significantly upregulated in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients but not in their leukemic B-cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data suggest that BACH2 and PRDM1 genes are significantly correlated with age in human immune cells and may be involved in immunosenescence.","['Chi, Vu Luan Dang', 'Garaud, Soizic', 'De Silva, Pushpamali', 'Thibaud, Vincent', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Berehad, Mimoune', 'Gu-Trantien, Chunyan', 'Krayem, Mohammad', 'Duvillier, Hugues', 'Lodewyckx, Jean-Nicolas', 'Willard-Gallo, Karen', 'Sibille, Catherine', 'Bron, Dominique']","['Chi VLD', 'Garaud S', 'De Silva P', 'Thibaud V', 'Stamatopoulos B', 'Berehad M', 'Gu-Trantien C', 'Krayem M', 'Duvillier H', 'Lodewyckx JN', 'Willard-Gallo K', 'Sibille C', 'Bron D']","['Clinical and Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue Heger Bordet 1, 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Clinical and Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue Heger Bordet 1, 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Clinical and Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue Heger Bordet 1, 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Clinical and Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue Heger Bordet 1, 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Institut of Medical Immunology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Oncology and Experimental Surgery, Institute Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Clinical and Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue Heger Bordet 1, 1000, Brussels, Belgium. dbron@ulb.ac.be.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190117,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC6337793,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5276-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5276-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jan 17;19(1):81. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5276-2.,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BACH2', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Immunosenescence', 'Lymphocytes', 'PRDM1']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1634-1104'],,,20190429,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*immunology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/immunology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/immunology', 'Young Adult']","['0 (BACH2 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUNX1, a critical transcription factor in hematopoietic development, is fused with almost the entire ETO sequence with the ability to recruit a wide range of repressors. Past efforts in providing a comprehensive picture of the genome-wide localization and the target genes of RUNX1-ETO have been inconclusive in understanding the underlying mechanism by which it deregulates native RUNX1. In this review; we dissect the current data on the epigenetic impact of RUNX1 and RUNX1-ETO. Both share similarities however, in recent years, research focused on epigenetic factors to explain their differences. RUNX1-ETO impairs DNA repair mechanisms which compromises genomic stability and favors a mutator phenotype. Among an increasing pool of mutated factors, regulators of DNA methylation are frequently found in t(8;21) AML. Together with the alteration of both, histone markers and distal enhancer regulation, RUNX1-ETO might specifically disrupt normal chromatin structure. Epigenetic studies on the fusion protein uncovered new mechanisms contributing to leukemogenesis and hopefully will translate into clinical applications.","['van der Kouwe, Emiel', 'Staber, Philipp Bernhard']","['van der Kouwe E', 'Staber PB']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. emiel.vanderkouwe@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. philipp.staber@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190116,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC6358732,,2019/01/19 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2019/01/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20020350 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20020350 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jan 16;20(2). pii: ijms20020350. doi: 10.3390/ijms20020350.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1', 'AML1-ETO', 'ETO', 'RUNX1', 'RUNX1-ETO', 'chromatin', 'conformation', 'enhancer', 'epigenetic', 'histone', 'leukemia', 'methylation']",['P 27132/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,20190429,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug delivery powered by recent advances in nanotechnology has boosted the efficacy of many drugs, which is enlightening for applications of ATO in treating solid tumors. Herein, we reported arsenite-loaded multifunctional nanoparticles that are capable of pH-responsive ATO release for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and real-time monitoring via magnetic resonance imaging. We fabricated these nanoparticles (designated as magnetic large-pore mesoporous silica nanoparticle (M-LPMSN)-NiAsO x ) by loading nanoparticulate ATO prodrugs (NiAsO x ) into the pores of large-pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (LPMSNs) that contain magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the center. The surface of these nanodrugs was modified with a targeting ligand folic acid (FA) to further enhance the drug efficacy. Releasing profiles manifest the responsive discharging of arsenite in acidic environment. In vitro experiments with SMMC-7721 cells reveal that M-LPMSN-NiAsO x -FA nanodrugs have significantly higher cytotoxicity than traditional free ATO and induce more cell apoptosis.

In this study, lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were constructed to explore the functions of potential competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) during the development of RE in dairy goats. We observed that circRNA8073 (ciR8073) decreased the levels of miR-181a by acting as a miRNA sponge. This effect indirectly increased the expression of neurotensin in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). Neurotensin then inhibited EEC apoptosis by increasing the expression of BCL-2/BAX in favor of BCL-2 via the MAPK pathway and also induced increased expression of leukemia-inhibitory factor, cyclo-oxygenase 2, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and homeobox A10. We have thus identified a ciR8073-miR181a-neurotensin pathway in the endometrium of dairy goats. Through this pathway, ciR8073 functions as a ceRNA that sequesters miR-181a, thereby protecting neurotensin transcripts from miR-181a-mediated suppression in EECs.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Liu, Xiaorui', 'Che, Sicheng', 'Cui, Jiuzeng', 'Ma, Xingna', 'An, Xiaopeng', 'Cao, Binyun', 'Song, Yuxuan']","['Zhang L', 'Liu X', 'Che S', 'Cui J', 'Ma X', 'An X', 'Cao B', 'Song Y']","['College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, P.R.

The purpose of this single-center Phase I study was to determine the safety and tolerability of administration of the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor (Mozobil; Sanofi Genzyme) along with myeloablative conditioning in patients with AML undergoing allogeneic HCT. The rationale was that plerixafor may mobilize leukemic stem cells, making them more susceptible to the conditioning chemotherapy (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier NCT01141543). Three patients were enrolled into each of 4 sequential cohorts (12 patients total). Patients in the first cohort received 1 dose of plerixafor (240 mug/kg s.c.) before the first dose of fludarabine and busulfan, and subsequent cohorts received injections before 2, 3, and 4 days of conditioning chemotherapy. The median age at HCT was 49 years (range, 38 to 58 years). All patients engrafted following HCT, with an absolute neutrophil count >/=.5x10(9)/L observed at a median of 14 days (range, 11 to 18 days). Adverse events possibly related to plerixafor were transient and not severe. Main adverse events following the injection were nausea and dizziness in 4 patients (33%) and fatigue in 4 patients (33%). Among the 12 patients, 2 patients (17%) relapsed post-HCT and 6 (50%) were alive at the last follow-up. The median follow-up of survivors was 67 months (range, 53 to 82 months). In conclusion, plerixafor administration is safe and well tolerated when included in a myeloablative conditioning regimen for allogeneic HCT for AML. Further study in a larger cohort is warranted for the investigation of the impact of plerixafor on post-allogeneic HCT outcomes.","['Michelis, Fotios V', 'Hedley, David W', 'Malhotra, Sonal', 'Chow, Sue', 'Loach, David', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Kim, Dennis D', 'Kuruvilla, John', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Messner, Hans A']","['Michelis FV', 'Hedley DW', 'Malhotra S', 'Chow S', 'Loach D', 'Gupta V', 'Kim DD', 'Kuruvilla J', 'Lipton JH', 'Viswabandya A', 'Messner HA']","['Messner Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

This differentiation process is controlled by transcription factors that establish stage- and cell type-specific gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that FUSE binding protein 1 (FUBP1), a transcriptional regulator important for HSC self-renewal and survival, is regulated by T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia 1 (TAL1) in erythroid progenitor cells. TAL1 directly activates the FUBP1 promoter, leading to increased FUBP1 expression during erythroid differentiation. The binding of TAL1 to the FUBP1 promoter is highly dependent on an intact GATA sequence in a combined E-box/GATA motif. We found that FUBP1 expression is required for efficient erythropoiesis, as FUBP1-deficient progenitor cells were limited in their potential of erythroid differentiation. Thus, the finding of an interconnection between GATA1/TAL1 and FUBP1 reveals a molecular mechanism that is part of the switch from progenitor- to erythrocyte-specific gene expression. In summary, we identified a TAL1/FUBP1 transcriptional relationship, whose physiological function in haematopoiesis is connected to proper erythropoiesis.","['Steiner, Marlene', 'Schneider, Lucas', 'Yillah, Jasmin', 'Gerlach, Katharina', 'Kuvardina, Olga N', 'Meyer, Annekarin', 'Maring, Alisa', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Zornig, Martin', 'Lausen, Jorn']","['Steiner M', 'Schneider L', 'Yillah J', 'Gerlach K', 'Kuvardina ON', 'Meyer A', 'Maring A', 'Bonig H', 'Seifried E', 'Zornig M', 'Lausen J']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC6336336,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2019/01/18 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0210515 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-24611 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jan 17;14(1):e0210515. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0210515. eCollection 2019.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8904-3151', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4417-2720']",,,20191118,IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FUBP1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both lenalidomide (LEN) and azacitidine (AZA) possess significant antitumor activity effect in AML. Administration of LEN post-transplantation is associated with excessive rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but AZA has been shown to ameliorate GVHD in murine transplantation models. We therefore examined the tolerability and activity of combined LEN/AZA administration in post-transplantation relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients who had relapsed after allo-SCT for AML (n = 24) or MDS (n = 5) were treated with sequential AZA (75 mg/m(2) for 7 days) followed by escalating doses of LEN on days 10 to 30. Dose allocation and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation were guided by a modified Bayesian continuous reassessment method (CRM). RESULTS: Sequential AZA and LEN therapy was well tolerated. The MTD of post-transplantation LEN, in combination with AZA, was determined as 25 mg daily. Three patients developed grade 2 to 4 GVHD. There was no GVHD-related mortality. Seven of 15 (47%) patients achieved a major clinical response after LEN/AZA therapy. CD8+ T cells demonstrated impaired interferon-gamma/tumor necrosis factor-alpha production at relapse, which was not reversed during LEN/AZA administration. CONCLUSION: We conclude LEN can be administered safely post-allograft in conjunction with AZA, and this combination demonstrates clinical activity in relapsed AML/MDS without reversing biologic features of T-cell exhaustion. The use of a CRM model delivered improved efficiency in MTD assessment and provided additional flexibility. Combined LEN/AZA therapy represents a novel and active salvage therapy in patients who had relapsed post-allograft.","['Craddock, Charles', 'Slade, Daniel', 'De Santo, Carmela', 'Wheat, Rachel', 'Ferguson, Paul', 'Hodgkinson, Andrea', 'Brock, Kristian', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Ingram, Wendy', 'Dennis, Mike', 'Malladi, Ram', 'Siddique, Shamyla', 'Mussai, Francis', 'Yap, Christina']","['Craddock C', 'Slade D', 'De Santo C', 'Wheat R', 'Ferguson P', 'Hodgkinson A', 'Brock K', 'Cavenagh J', 'Ingram W', 'Dennis M', 'Malladi R', 'Siddique S', 'Mussai F', 'Yap C']","['1 Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '3 University Hospital North Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""4 St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", '5 University College Hospital, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', '6 The Christie Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom.', '1 Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', '2 University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190117,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC6494237,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.00889 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Mar 1;37(7):580-588. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.00889.

Lymphoma is one of the underlying causes of granuloma; and sometimes the neoplastic cells may be masked by the granulomatous reaction. In this report, we present our experience with 7 lymphoma cases of various histologic types with coexisting granuloma to show the diagnostic challenges. In all cases, a granulomatous reaction was simultaneously present with the neoplastic cells. The 7 cases included 3 cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in the lymph node or skin including one coexisting with mycobacterial infection, 2 cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma involving the liver, and 1 case each of systemic Epstein-Barr virus-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma and a hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor-like follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. Three cases were initially misdiagnosed as reactive change or mycobacterial infection instead of lymphoma, and a wrong histologic lymphoma type was diagnosed in 1 case. In this report, we showed that granulomatous reaction might mask lymphomas of various histologic types; and a diagnosis of mycobacterial infection or sarcoidosis could not exclude the possibility of an underlying lymphoma. We emphasized the importance of detailed histologic examination with the aid of ancillary studies to reach a correct diagnosis and to avoid inappropriate management of the patients. Our study also broadened the spectrum of lymphoma types coexisting with granuloma.","['Wu, Chih-Ying', 'Wang, Ren-Ching', 'Chen, Bo-Jung', 'Chen, Wei-Yu', 'Jhuang, Jie-Yang', 'Chang, Ming-Chih', 'Wu, Yu-Hung', 'Nakada, Norihiro', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Chuang, Shih-Sung']","['Wu CY', 'Wang RC', 'Chen BJ', 'Chen WY', 'Jhuang JY', 'Chang MC', 'Wu YH', 'Nakada N', 'Karube K', 'Chuang SS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital.', 'Department of Nursing, Hungkuang University, Taichung, Taiwan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Shuang-Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University.', 'Department of Pathology, Wanfang Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei.', 'Departments of Pathology.', 'Hemato-Oncology.', 'Dermatology, Mackay Memorial Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, Nakagami Hospital, Okinawa.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.', 'Department of Pathology, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,,2019/01/18 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000731 [doi]', '00129039-202004000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2020 Apr;28(4):316-324. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000731.,,,,,,,,20210601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', '*Granuloma/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*metabolism', '*Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review discusses this data and potential reasons for the efficacy of these venetoclax-based combinations. RECENT FINDINGS: Venetoclax with hypomethylators and low-dose cytarabine have resulted in high response rates, promising response durations, and significant overall survival in relatively small, uncontrolled studies. There is emerging data that these responses are due to the effective targeting of leukemia stem cells through an alteration of the metabolic environment that is poorly tolerated by this population. SUMMARY: Venetoclax with a backbone therapy in older, untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia has shown promising efficacy in preliminary clinical trials, and at least partially works through a novel mechanism that can target the leukemia stem cell population. Future investigations will help elucidate the mechanism and the contributions being made by each agent in the regimen.","['Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Pollyea DA', 'Jordan CT']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,2019/01/18 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000485 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Mar;26(2):71-76. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000485.,,,,,,,,20200513,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']","['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A second follow-up through 2012 was conducted of 2514 White male workers employed 1942-1966 at the MCW for dose-response analyses for selected causes of death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organ/tissue-specific dose reconstruction included both external (12,686 MCW film badge records, 210 other facility film badge records, and 31,297 occupational chest x-rays) and internal sources of uranium and radium (39,451 urine bioassays, 2341 breath radon measurements, and 6846 ambient radon measurements). Dust measurements from pitchblende facilitated quantitative risk estimates for non-radiogenic effects on the lung and kidney. Vital status was determined from multiple sources including the National Death Index and the Social Security Administration. Cox regression models were used for dose response analyses. RESULTS: Vital status was determined for 99% of the workers, of whom 75% had died. The mean lung dose from all sources of external and internal radiation combined was 69.9 mGy (maximum 885 mGy; percent workers >100 mGy, 10%) and there was no evidence for a dose response for lung cancer (Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.95 (95% CI = 0.81-1.12) at 100 mGy). A significant association with radiation was found for kidney cancer (HR of 1.73 (95% CI = 1.04-2.79) at 100 mGy) and suggested for nonmalignant kidney diseases (HR of 1.30 (95% CI = 0.96-1.76) at 100 mGy). A non-radiation etiology could not be discounted, however, because of the possible renal toxicities of uranium, a heavy metal, and silica, a component of pitchblende dust. Non-significant HRs at 100 mGy for other sites of a priori interest were 0.36 (0.06-2.03) for leukemia other than CLL, 0.68 (0.17-2.77) for liver cancer, and 1.23 (0.79-1.90) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The HR at 100 mGy was 1.09 (0.99-1.20) for ischemic heart disease. An association was seen between dust and combined malignant and non-malignant lung disease, HR at 10 mgm(-3)year(-1) of 1.01 (1.00-1.02). CONCLUSIONS: A positive radiation dose response was observed for malignant and non-malignant kidney disease, and a negative dose response for malignant and non-malignant lung disease. Cumulative measures of dust were significantly associated with malignant and non-malignant lung disease and suggested for malignant and non-malignant kidney disease. Small numbers preclude definitive interpretations which will await the combination with similar studies of early uranium processing workers.","['Golden, Ashley P', 'Ellis, Elizabeth D', 'Cohen, Sarah S', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Leggett, Richard W', 'Wallace, Phillip W', 'Girardi, David', 'Watkins, Janice P', 'Shore, Roy E', 'Boice, John D']","['Golden AP', 'Ellis ED', 'Cohen SS', 'Mumma MT', 'Leggett RW', 'Wallace PW', 'Girardi D', 'Watkins JP', 'Shore RE', 'Boice JD']","['a Oak Ridge Associated Universities , Oak Ridge , TN , USA.', 'a Oak Ridge Associated Universities , Oak Ridge , TN , USA.', 'b EpidStat Institute , Ann Arbor , MI , USA.', 'c International Epidemiology Institute , Rockville , MD , USA.', 'd Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Oak Ridge , TN , USA.', 'a Oak Ridge Associated Universities , Oak Ridge , TN , USA.', 'a Oak Ridge Associated Universities , Oak Ridge , TN , USA.', 'a Oak Ridge Associated Universities , Oak Ridge , TN , USA.', 'e Epidemiology Division, New York University School of Medicine , NewYork , NY , USA.', 'f Radiation Effects Research Foundation , Hiroshima , Japan.', 'g National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements , Bethesda , MD , USA.', 'h Department of Medicine, Division of Epidemiology , Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center , Nashville , TN , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190117,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/01/18 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553002.2019.1569773 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Radiat Biol. 2019 Jan 17:1-21. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2019.1569773.,['NOTNLM'],"['Alpha emitters', 'epidemiology', 'kidney', 'lung', 'radiation']",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9430-7702', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2871-1587', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0421-1983', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7506-8710', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8755-1299']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). ATL cells are known to express cell surface OX40; however, the level of soluble OX40 (sOX40) in blood samples from ATL patients is unknown. Quantitative enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) showed that sOX40 levels were significantly higher in plasma from acute ATL patients than those from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and healthy donors, and correlated with sCD25 levels and HTLV-1 proviral loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fresh PBMCs from acute ATL patients showed a higher percentage of OX40-positive cells compared with those from carriers, and shed sOX40 into culture supernatants. Shedding of sOX40 was partially inhibited by a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, GM6001. A fraction of sOX40 was capable of binding to OX40L. These results suggest that high levels of sOX40 are shed into blood from a large number of ATL cells in acute ATL patients. Thus, abnormally elevated plasma sOX40 levels may be useful as an additional diagnostic marker of acute ATL.","['Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Takahashi, Yoshiaki', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Miyagi, Takuya', 'Saito, Mineki', 'Fukushima, Takuya']","['Tanaka Y', 'Takahashi Y', 'Tanaka R', 'Miyagi T', 'Saito M', 'Fukushima T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Uehara 208, Nishihara-cho, Nakagami-gun, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. yuetsu@s4.dion.ne.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Uehara 208, Nishihara-cho, Nakagami-gun, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Uehara 208, Nishihara-cho, Nakagami-gun, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Uehara 208, Nishihara-cho, Nakagami-gun, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190116,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-02580-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-02580-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Mar;109(3):319-327. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-02580-z.

The ability to obtain deeper remissions, without selecting for deletion 17p, by using novel B-cell receptor (BCR) antagonists and bcl2 inhibition might lead to a decrease in the incidence of RS, but these agents have done little to significantly change outcomes when incorporated into treatment regimens for RS.

Immunity has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We performed a SNP array on chromosome 6 in CD34(+) purified blasts from 19 patients diagnosed with advanced MDS and 8 patients with other myeloid malignancies to evaluate the presence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in HLA and its impact on disease progression. Three patients had acquired copy-neutral LOH (CN-LOH) on 6p arms, which may disrupt antigen presentation and act as a mechanism for immune system evasion. Interestingly, these patients had previously been classified at low risk of AML progression, and the poor outcome cannot be explained by the acquisition of adverse mutations. LOH HLA was not detected in the remaining 24 patients, who all had adverse risk factors. In summary, the clinical outcome of patients with advanced MDS might be influenced by HLA allelic loss, wich allows subclonal expansions to evade cytotoxic-T and NK cell attack. CN-LOH HLA may therefore be a factor favoring MDS progression to AML independently of the somatic tumor mutation load.","['Montes, Paola', 'Kerick, Martin', 'Bernal, Monica', 'Hernandez, Francisca', 'Jimenez, Pilar', 'Garrido, Pilar', 'Marquez, Ana', 'Jurado, Manuel', 'Martin, Javier', 'Garrido, Federico', 'Ruiz-Cabello, Francisco']","['Montes P', 'Kerick M', 'Bernal M', 'Hernandez F', 'Jimenez P', 'Garrido P', 'Marquez A', 'Jurado M', 'Martin J', 'Garrido F', 'Ruiz-Cabello F']","['Servicio de Analisis Clinicos e Inmunologia, UGC de Laboratorio Clinico, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra, CSIC, Granada, Spain.', 'Servicio de Analisis Clinicos e Inmunologia, UGC de Laboratorio Clinico, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'UGC de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'Servicio de Analisis Clinicos e Inmunologia, UGC de Laboratorio Clinico, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'UGC de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra, CSIC, Granada, Spain.', 'UGC de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra, CSIC, Granada, Spain.', 'Servicio de Analisis Clinicos e Inmunologia, UGC de Laboratorio Clinico, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria ibs.Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Departamento Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular e Inmunologia III, Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Servicio de Analisis Clinicos e Inmunologia, UGC de Laboratorio Clinico, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria ibs.Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Departamento Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular e Inmunologia III, Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181211,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC6319343,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.'],2019/01/18 06:00,2019/01/18 06:01,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26405 [doi]', '26405 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Dec 11;9(97):36929-36944. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26405. eCollection 2018 Dec 11.,['NOTNLM'],"['hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)', 'human leukocyte antigen (HLA)', 'loss of heterozygosity (LOH)', 'myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)', 'single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP array)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have yielded successful outcomes, the improvement on the survival rate of NSCLC and mesothelioma have been less marked. Recently, adoptive immunotherapy, particularly chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy demonstrated promise for improving the survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with minimum toxicity. However, its application in solid tumors still warrants in-depth investigations and multiple consistent trial results, particularly in eliminating 'off-tumor' toxicity. To explore CAR-T therapy in NSCLC and mesothelioma, second-generation CAR-T cells were constructed targeting mesothelin (MSLN), which is abundant in NSCLC and mesothelioma but is under expressed in normal tissues. The second-generation design incorporated co-stimulatory CD28 and 4-1BB signaling domains to enhance the proliferation. Following the successful analysis of CAR-T cells by flow cytometry, cytotoxicity experiments were performed using the LDH kit to verify the killing effect of CAR-T cells on target cells. Otherwise, the in vivo killing tumor activity of MSLN CAR-T cells was verified by constructing a mouse model using tumor-derived cells from patients to inoculate the mice. When the effector-to-target ratio is >0.5:1, CAR-T MSLN cells exhibited significantly higher ability to kill tumor cells than T cells. In in vivo experiments, mice whose tail vein was injected with CAR-T MSLN cells demonstrated significantly slower tumor growth. Without continuous administration, both groups became gradually synchronized in growth of tumor size, which suggests that the persistence of CAR-T cells is an important issue in preclinical studies.","['Ye, Lin', 'Lou, Yuqing', 'Lu, Liming', 'Fan, Xiaohong']","['Ye L', 'Lou Y', 'Lu L', 'Fan X']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, P.R.

Mutations of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene occur in approximately 30% of all AML cases, with the internal tandem duplication (ITD) representing the most common type of FLT3 mutation (FLT3-ITD; approximately 25% of all AML cases). FLT3-ITD is a common driver mutation that presents with a high leukemic burden and confers a poor prognosis in patients with AML. The prognostic value of a FLT3 mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD), which has a lower incidence in AML (approximately 7-10% of all cases), is uncertain. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that FLT3 mutational status evolves throughout the disease continuum. This so-called clonal evolution, together with the identification of FLT3-ITD as a negative prognostic marker, serves to highlight the importance of FLT3-ITD testing at diagnosis and again at relapse. Earlier identification of FLT3 mutations will help provide a better understanding of the patient's disease and enable targeted treatment that may help patients achieve longer and more durable remissions. First-generation FLT3 inhibitors developed for clinical use are broad-spectrum, multikinase inhibitors; however, next-generation FLT3 inhibitors are more specific, more potent, and have fewer toxicities associated with off-target effects. Primary and secondary acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibitors remains a challenge and provides a rationale for combining FLT3 inhibitors with other therapies, both conventional and investigational. This review focuses on the pathological and prognostic role of FLT3 mutations in AML, clinical classification of the disease, recent progress with next-generation FLT3 inhibitors, and mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.","['Daver, Naval', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Levis, Mark J']","['Daver N', 'Schlenk RF', 'Russell NH', 'Levis MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'National Center of Tumor Diseases, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. levisma@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190116,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6365380,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0357-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0357-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Feb;33(2):299-312. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0357-9.

We analyzed the combinatorial effect of haploinsufficiency for Rps14, Csnk1a1, and miRNA-145, using mice with genetically engineered, conditional heterozygous inactivation of Rps14 and Csnk1a1 and stable knockdown of miR-145/miR-146a. Combined Rps14/Csnk1a1/miR-145/146a deficiency recapitulated the cardinal features of the 5q- syndrome, including (1) more severe anemia with faster kinetics than Rps14 haploinsufficiency alone and (2) pathognomonic megakaryocyte morphology. Macrophages, regulatory cells of erythropoiesis and the innate immune response, were significantly increased in Rps14/Csnk1a1/miR-145/146a deficient mice as well as in 5q- syndrome patient bone marrows and showed activation of the innate immune response, reflected by increased expression of S100A8, and decreased phagocytic function. We demonstrate that Rps14/Csnk1a1/miR-145 and miR-146a deficient macrophages alter the microenvironment and induce S100A8 expression in the mesenchymal stem cell niche. The increased S100A8 expression in the mesenchymal niche was confirmed in 5q- syndrome patients.

Although Negr1 has been shown to regulate neurite outgrowth and synapse formation, the mechanism through which this protein affects mood disorders is still largely unknown. In this research, we characterized Negr1-deficient (negr1(-/-)) mice to elucidate the function of Negr1 in anxiety and depression. We found that anxiety- and depression-like behaviors increased in negr1(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, negr1(-/-) mice had decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis compared to wild-type mice. Concurrently, both LTP and mEPSC in the dentate gyrus (DG) region were severely compromised in negr1(-/-) mice. In our effort to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) expression was decreased in the hippocampus of negr1(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice. Heterologous Lcn2 expression in the hippocampal DG of negr1(-/-) mice rescued anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and restored neurogenesis and mEPSC frequency to their normal levels in these mice. Furthermore, we discovered that Negr1 interacts with leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and modulates LIF-induced Lcn2 expression. Taken together, our data uncovered a novel mechanism of mood regulation by Negr1 involving an interaction between Negr1 and LIFR along with Lcn2 expression.","['Noh, Kyungchul', 'Lee, Hyunkyoung', 'Choi, Tae-Yong', 'Joo, Yeonhee', 'Kim, Soo-Joeng', 'Kim, Hyejin', 'Kim, Jin Young', 'Jahng, Jeong Won', 'Lee, Soojin', 'Choi, Se-Young', 'Lee, Sung Joong']","['Noh K', 'Lee H', 'Choi TY', 'Joo Y', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim H', 'Kim JY', 'Jahng JW', 'Lee S', 'Choi SY', 'Lee SJ']","['Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. leesoojin@cnu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea. sychoi@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Republic of Korea. sjlee87@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190116,England,Mol Psychiatry,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,,,2019/01/18 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41380-018-0347-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41380-018-0347-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Psychiatry. 2019 Aug;24(8):1189-1205. doi: 10.1038/s41380-018-0347-3.

Crenolanib, a potent type I pan-FLT3 inhibitor, is effective against both internal tandem duplications and resistance-conferring tyrosine kinase domain mutations. While crenolanib monotherapy has demonstrated clinical benefit in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory AML patients, responses are transient and relapse eventually occurs. Here, to investigate the mechanisms of crenolanib resistance, we perform whole exome sequencing of AML patient samples before and after crenolanib treatment. Unlike other FLT3 inhibitors, crenolanib does not induce FLT3 secondary mutations, and mutations of the FLT3 gatekeeper residue are infrequent. Instead, mutations of NRAS and IDH2 arise, mostly as FLT3-independent subclones, while TET2 and IDH1 predominantly co-occur with FLT3-mutant clones and are enriched in crenolanib poor-responders. The remaining patients exhibit post-crenolanib expansion of mutations associated with epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, and cohesion factors, suggesting diverse genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of crenolanib resistance. Drug combinations in experimental models restore crenolanib sensitivity.","['Zhang, Haijiao', 'Savage, Samantha', 'Schultz, Anna Reister', 'Bottomly, Daniel', 'White, Libbey', 'Segerdell, Erik',

The underlying mechanisms of late relapse remain poorly understood. We identified patients with AML who achieved remission with standard induction chemotherapy and relapsed after at least five years of remission (n = 15). Whole exome sequencing was performed in available bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis (n = 10), remission (n = 6), and first relapse (n = 10). A total of 41 driver mutations were identified, of which 11 were primary tumor-specific, 17 relapse-specific, and 13 shared (detected both in primary and relapsed tumor samples). We demonstrated that 12 of 13 shared mutations were in epigenetic modifier and spliceosome genes. Longitudinal genomic characterization revealed that in eight of 10 patients the founder leukemic clone persisted after chemotherapy and established the basis of relapse years later. Understanding the mechanisms of such quiescence in leukemic cells may help designing future strategies aimed at increasing remission duration in patients with AML.","['Yilmaz, Musa', 'Wang, Feng', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Gumbs, Curtis', 'Little, Latasha', 'Song, Xingzhi', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Short, Nicholas', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Futreal, Andrew', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Yilmaz M', 'Wang F', 'Loghavi S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Gumbs C', 'Little L', 'Song X', 'Zhang J', 'Kadia T', 'Borthakur G', 'Jabbour E', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Short N', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Estrov Z', 'Kantarjian H', 'Futreal A', 'Takahashi K', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190116,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,PMC6335405,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0170-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0170-3 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2019 Jan 16;9(2):7. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0170-3.,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8980-3202'],,,20191230,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Young Adult']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prolonging thymus autonomy was shown to be permissive to the development of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), similar to the human disease. In this study, performing thymus transplantation experiments in mice, we report that thymus autonomy can occur in several experimental conditions, and all are permissive to T-ALL. We show that wild type thymi maintain their function of T lymphocyte production upon transplantation into recipients with several genotypes (and corresponding phenotypic differences), i.e., Rag2 (-) (/) (-) gammac (-) (/) (-), gammac (-) (/) (-), Rag2 (-) (/) (-) IL-7ralpha (-) (/) (-), and IL-7ralpha (-) (/) (-) We found that the cellularity of the thymus grafts is influenced exclusively by the genotype of the host, i.e., IL-7ralpha(-/-) versus gammac (-/-) Nonetheless, the difference in cellularity detected in thymus autonomy bore no impact on onset, incidence, immunophenotype, or pathologic condition of T-ALL. In all tested conditions, T-ALL reached an incidence of 80%, demonstrating that thymus autonomy bears a high risk of leukemia. We also analyzed the microbiota composition of the recipients and their genetic background, but none of the differences found influenced the development of T-ALL. Taken together, our data support that IL-7 drives cellular turnover non-cell autonomously, which is required for prevention of T-ALL. We found no influence for T-ALL in the specific combination of the genotypic mutations tested (including the developmental block caused by Rag deficiency), in microbiota composition, or minor differences in the genetic background of the strains.","['Ballesteros-Arias, Luna', 'Silva, Joana G', 'Paiva, Rafael A', 'Carbonetto, Belen', 'Faisca, Pedro', 'Martins, Vera C']","['Ballesteros-Arias L', 'Silva JG', 'Paiva RA', 'Carbonetto B', 'Faisca P', 'Martins VC']","['Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal; and.', 'Histopathology Unit, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal; vmartins@igc.gulbenkian.pt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190116,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801373 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801373 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Feb 15;202(4):1137-1144. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801373.

However, the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumors is poor, likely due to tumor-associated immunosuppression. Here, we demonstrated that antagonizing the ""inhibitor of apoptosis proteins"" with the clinical smac-mimetic, birinapant, significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of CAR T cells in a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent manner. Enhanced tumor cell death occurred independently of the perforin-mediated granule exocytosis pathway, underscoring the cytotoxic potential of CAR T-cell-derived TNF. Combining CAR T-cell therapy with birinapant significantly reduced established tumor growth in vivo, where either therapy alone was relatively ineffective. Using patient biopsy-derived tumoroids, we demonstrated the synergistic potential of combining CAR T-cell therapy with smac-mimetics.

We recently proposed a novel classifier based on the copy-number alteration (CNA) profile of the 8 most commonly deleted genes in B-cell precursor ALL. This classifier defined 3 CNA subgroups in consecutive UK trials and was able to discriminate patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In this study, we sought to validate the United Kingdom ALL (UKALL)-CNA classifier and reevaluate the interaction with cytogenetic risk groups using individual patient data from 3239 cases collected from 12 groups within the International BFM Study Group. The classifier was validated and defined 3 risk groups with distinct event-free survival (EFS) rates: good (88%), intermediate (76%), and poor (68%) (P < .001). There was no evidence of heterogeneity, even within trials that used minimal residual disease to guide therapy. By integrating CNA and cytogenetic data, we replicated our original key observation that patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics can be stratified into 2 prognostic subgroups. Group A had an EFS rate of 86% (similar to patients with good-risk cytogenetics), while group B patients had a significantly inferior rate (73%, P < .001). Finally, we revised the overall genetic classification by defining 4 risk groups with distinct EFS rates: very good (91%), good (81%), intermediate (73%), and poor (54%), P < .001. In conclusion, the UKALL-CNA classifier is a robust prognostic tool that can be deployed in different trial settings and used to refine established cytogenetic risk groups.","['Hamadeh, Lina', 'Enshaei, Amir', 'Schwab, Claire', 'Alonso, Cristina N', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Boer, Judith M', 'Braun, Marcin', 'Dalla Pozza, Luciano', 'Elitzur, Sarah', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Fechina, Larisa', 'Felice, Maria Sara', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Haltrich, Iren', 'Heyman, Mats M', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Jeison, Marta', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Kuiper, Roland P', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Nebral, Karin', 'Ivanov Ofverholm, Ingegerd', 'Pastorczak, Agata', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Piko, Henriett', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Rubio, Patricia', 'Strehl, Sabine', 'Stary, Jan', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Trka, Jan', 'Tsaur, Grigory', 'Venn, Nicola', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Yano, Mio', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Moorman, Anthony V']","['Hamadeh L', 'Enshaei A', 'Schwab C', 'Alonso CN', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Barbany G', 'den Boer ML', 'Boer JM', 'Braun M', 'Dalla Pozza L', 'Elitzur S', 'Emerenciano M', 'Fechina L', 'Felice MS', 'Fronkova E', 'Haltrich I', 'Heyman MM', 'Horibe K', 'Imamura T', 'Jeison M', 'Kovacs G', 'Kuiper RP', 'Mlynarski W', 'Nebral K', 'Ivanov Ofverholm I', 'Pastorczak A', 'Pieters R', 'Piko H', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Rubio P', 'Strehl S', 'Stary J', 'Sutton R', 'Trka J', 'Tsaur G', 'Venn N', 'Vora A', 'Yano M', 'Harrison CJ', 'Moorman AV']","['Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom.', 'Hematology-Oncology Department, Hospital de Pediatria ""Prof. Dr. J.

We identified a lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) family member, LAMP5, that is specifically and highly expressed in patients with MLL leukemia. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the functional relevance and clinical value of LAMP5 in the disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We first recruited a large cohort of leukemia patients to validate LAMP5 expression and evaluate its clinical value. We then performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the functional relevance of LAMP5 in MLL leukemia progression or maintenance. RESULTS: LAMP5 was validated as being specifically and highly expressed in patients with MLL leukemia and was associated with a poor outcome. Functional studies showed that LAMP5 is a novel autophagic suppressor and protects MLL fusion proteins from autophagic degradation. Specifically targeting LAMP5 significantly promoted degradation of MLL fusion proteins and inhibited MLL leukemia progression in both an animal model and primary cells. We further revealed that LAMP5 is a direct target of the H3K79 histone methyltransferase DOT1L. Downregulating LAMP5 with a DOT1L inhibitor enhanced the selective autophagic degradation of MLL oncoproteins and extended survival in vivo; this observation was especially significant when combining DOT1L inhibitors with LAMP5 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that LAMP5 serves as a ""bodyguard"" for MLL fusions to evade degradation and is the first to link H3K79 methylation to autophagy regulation, highlighting the potential of LAMP5 as a therapeutic target for MLL leukemia.","['Wang, Wen-Tao', 'Han, Cai', 'Sun, Yu-Meng', 'Chen, Zhen-Hua', 'Fang, Ke', 'Huang, Wei', 'Sun, Lin-Yu', 'Zeng, Zhan-Cheng', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Wang WT', 'Han C', 'Sun YM', 'Chen ZH', 'Fang K', 'Huang W', 'Sun LY', 'Zeng ZC', 'Luo XQ', 'Chen YQ']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. lsscyq@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190116,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,,2019/01/18 06:00,2020/06/20 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-1474 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1474 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 May 1;25(9):2795-2808. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1474.

However, the mechanisms of drug resistance remain elusive, limiting therapeutic efficacy. Here, we set out to explore the relationship between dynamic histone changes and the efficacy of cisplatin against OS. RESULTS: First, we found two histone demethylases associated with histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylation, KDM6A, and KDM6B that were upregulated after cisplatin treatment. Consistent with the clinical data, cisplatin-resistant OS specimens showed lower H3K27me3 levels than sensitive specimens. Then, we evaluated the effects of H3K27me3 alteration on OS chemosensitivity. In vitro inhibition of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in OS cells decreased H3K27me3 levels and led to cisplatin resistance. Conversely, inhibition of the demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B increased H3K27me3 levels in OS and reversed cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, with the help of RNA sequencing (RNAseq), we found that PRKCA and MCL1 directly participated in the process by altering H3K27me3 on their gene loci, ultimately inactivating RAF/ERK/MAPK cascades and decreasing phosphorylation of BCL2. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a new epigenetic mechanism of OS resistance and indicates that elevated H3K27me3 levels can sensitize OS to cisplatin, suggesting a promising new strategy for the treatment of OS.","['He, Chao', 'Sun, Jian', 'Liu, Chao', 'Jiang, Yuhang', 'Hao, Yongqiang']","['He C', 'Sun J', 'Liu C', 'Jiang Y', 'Hao Y']","[""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China."", ""Department of Emergency, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China."", ""Department of Oromaxillofacial Head and Neck Oncology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China. 79668635@qq.com."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China. xhaka2016@163.com."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orthopedic Implants, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China. haoyq1664@sh9hospital.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190116,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,PMC6335728,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-018-0605-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-018-0605-x [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2019 Jan 16;11(1):8. doi: 10.1186/s13148-018-0605-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Chemoresistance', '*H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)', '*KDM6A', '*KDM6B', '*Osteosarcoma']",,,,,,20190820,,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['0 (Histones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6B protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Innovative therapy approaches aim to complement standard chemotherapy to improve drug efficacy and decrease toxicity. Promising new therapeutic targets in cancer therapy include voltage-gated Kv1.3 potassium channels, but their role in acute leukemia is unclear. We reported that Kv1.3 channels of lymphocytes are blocked by memantine, which is known as an antagonist of neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptors and clinically applied in therapy of advanced Alzheimer disease. Here we evaluated whether pharmacological targeting of Kv1.3 channels by memantine promotes cell death of acute leukemia cells induced by chemotherapeutic cytarabine. METHODS: We analyzed acute lymphoid (Jurkat, CEM) and myeloid (HL-60, Molm-13, OCI-AML-3) leukemia cell lines and patients' acute leukemic blasts after treatment with either drug alone or the combination of cytarabine and memantine. Patch-clamp analysis was performed to evaluate inhibition of Kv1.3 channels and membrane depolarization by memantine. Cell death was determined with propidium iodide, Annexin V and SYTOX staining and cytochrome C release assay. Molecular effects of memantine co-treatment on activation of Caspases, AKT, ERK1/2, and JNK signaling were analysed by Western blot. Kv1.3 channel expression in Jurkat cells was downregulated by shRNA. RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that memantine inhibits Kv1.3 channels of acute leukemia cells and in combination with cytarabine potentiates cell death of acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as primary leukemic blasts from acute leukemia patients. At molecular level, memantine co-application fosters concurrent inhibition of AKT, S6 and ERK1/2 and reinforces nuclear down-regulation of MYC, a common target of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, it augments mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in enhanced cytochrome C release and activation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 leading to amplified apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underlines inhibition of Kv1.3 channels as a therapeutic strategy in acute leukemia and proposes co-treatment with memantine, a licensed and safe drug, as a potential approach to promote cytarabine-based cell death of various subtypes of acute leukemia.","['Lowinus, Theresa', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Bose, Tanima', 'Nimmagadda, Subbaiah Chary', 'Schnoder, Tina', 'Cammann, Clemens', 'Schmitz, Ingo', 'Seifert, Ulrike', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Schraven, Burkhart', 'Bommhardt, Ursula']","['Lowinus T', 'Heidel FH', 'Bose T', 'Nimmagadda SC', 'Schnoder T', 'Cammann C', 'Schmitz I', 'Seifert U', 'Fischer T', 'Schraven B', 'Bommhardt U']","['Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation (GC-I3), Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, 39120, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Present address: Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, GC-I3, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz-Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute of Neurobiology, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Present address: Institute for Clinical Neuroimmunology, Ludwigs-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, GC-I3, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, GC-I3, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz-Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Medical Microbiology, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation (GC-I3), Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, 39120, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Systems-Oriented Immunology and Inflammation Research Group, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation (GC-I3), Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, 39120, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Medical Microbiology, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, GC-I3, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation (GC-I3), Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, 39120, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Immune Control, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation (GC-I3), Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, 39120, Magdeburg, Germany.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is the main clinical manifestation of HBsAg-positive glomerulonephritis. However, the development of HBVr combined with NS after allo-HSCT is uncommon. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a case of a 47-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia who underwent HLA-identical sibling allo-HSCT and achieved leukemia free survival. She had pretransplant serological markers of a resolved HBV infection (HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc and anti-HBs positive). However, she developed HBVr combined with nephrotic syndrome (NS) 16 months after HSCT. Her histological renal lesion was mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. IgA+, IgM+, and C1q deposits but not HBV antigens (HBsAg and HBcAg) were identified in her renal biopsy material. Long-term entecavir and immunosuppression resulted in decrease of HBV virus replication, amelioration of proteinuria and stabilisation of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Entecavir combined with immunosuppression has efficacy in the treatment of HBVr combined with NS after allo-HSCT, but long course of treatment is needed. Closely monitoring and antiviral prophylaxis might be necessary for allo-HSCT recipients to prevent reactivation of resolved HBV infection and its related complications.","['Zhang, Jing-Wen', 'Zhang, Xiang-Zhong', 'Sun, Yan-Ling', 'Long, Bing', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhen', 'Li, Xu-Dong']","['Zhang JW', 'Zhang XZ', 'Sun YL', 'Long B', 'Wang XZ', 'Li XD']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, China. lixudong_sysu@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190116,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,PMC6335709,,2019/01/18 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2019/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-019-3690-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-019-3690-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Jan 16;19(1):57. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-3690-3.,['NOTNLM'],"['Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Hepatitis B virus', 'Immunosuppression', 'Nephrotic syndrome', 'Reactivation']","['2018A0303130248/Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province', 'QHJH201806/the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Clinical', 'Research Program']",,,,,20190318,IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis/virology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatitis B/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis B Core Antigens/blood', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/immunology', 'Hepatitis B virus/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/etiology/*virology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Virus Activation/drug effects']","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Core Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '5968Y6H45M (entecavir)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

German doctor first found that Fowler arsenic solution might improve symptoms of leukemia patients in 1865 but the therapy was never popular due to uncertainty. In 1931, American hematologists reported a series of chronic myeloid leukemia cases successfully managed by arsenic solutions , and published the pathological data supporting the specificity of arsenic action on leu- kemic cells. Not until late 1970s, after the publication of new FAB classification of leukemia, Chinese doctors from Harbin Medical University who had been exploring novel applications of traditional Chinese medi- cines, discovered that the new leukemic entity, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was the best indica- tion for arsenic containing remedy. The theory was supported by many APL survivors and later trials with As(2)Omicron(3), as a monotherapy. The Harbin Protocol was soon repeated successful in China and in the West, and As(2)Omicron(3), became a FDA approved new drug for APL in 2001. The discovery of arsenic therapy for APL was ap- parently not an incidental finding, but a timely advance following medical innovation. The continuing efforts in the research of traditional Chinese medicine and the teamwork of specialists in Chinese medicine, hema- tology, pathology, and pharmacology made this innovative discovery possible.","['Li, Yong-Ming']",['Li YM'],,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,,,2017/04/01 00:00,2017/04/01 00:01,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2017 Apr;37(4):401-405.,,,,,,,,20190221,IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Arsenic/therapeutic use', 'Arsenicals', 'China', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Oxides']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods Human acute leukemia mononuclear strain THP-1 was induced to become TAMs using Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) combined IL-4 and IL- 13. The supernant of TAMs and A549 cells were co-cultured. A co-culture model was set up by simulating microenvironment of lung cancer. Then cells were divided into the blank control group (A549) , the co- culture group (A549 +TAMs) , high, middle, and low dose WEG groups (TAMs +A549 + high, middle, and low dose WEG). The effects of WEG on the proliferation/metastasis of lung cancer A549 cells and the expression of F-actin under various conditions were detected using MTT method, Real time cell analysis (RTCA) , and high content screening (HCS). Results Compared with the blank control group, the pro- liferation of A549 cells was obviously increased, cell migration was obviously elevated, and the area of cell skeleton was markedly enlarged in the TAMs + A549 group, with statistical difference (P <0. 05). Compared with the TAMs +A549 group, the proliferation and migration of A549 cells were inhibited, the area of cell skeleton and the number of microfilaments were reduced dose-dependently (P <0. 05). Conclusion WEG could effectively inhibit the proliferation and migration of A549 cells, which might be a- chieved by adjusting immunoactivities of TAMs, and further it affected biological behaviors of tumor cells.","['Gao, Jing', 'Bi, Lei', 'Jiang, Yu-Cui', 'Yang, Ye', 'Li, Bian-Ying', 'Chen, Wei-Ping']","['Gao J', 'Bi L', 'Jiang YC', 'Yang Y', 'Li BY', 'Chen WP']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,,,2017/03/01 00:00,2017/03/01 00:01,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2017 Mar;37(3):345-350.,,,,,,,,20190221,IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Actin Cytoskeleton', '*Actins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', '*Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Macrophages/metabolism', '*Panax', '*Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Water']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defining the features that allow identification of APL patients likely to relapse after therapy remains challenging. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Proteomic profiling is performed on 20 newly diagnosed APL, 205 non-APL AML, and 10 normal CD34+ samples using Reverse Phase Protein Arrays probed with 230 antibodies. RESULTS: Comparison between APL and non-APL AML samples identifies 8.3% of the proteins to be differentially expressed. Proteins higher expressed in APL are involved in the pro-apoptotic pathways or are linked to higher proliferation. The ""MetaGalaxy"" approach that considers proteins in relation to other assayed proteins stratifies the APL patients into two protein signatures. All of the relapse patients (n = 4/4) are in protein signature 2 (S2). Comparison of proteins between the signatures shows significant differences in relative expression for 38 proteins. Protein expression summary plots suggest less translational activity in combination with a less proliferative character for S2 compared to signature 1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides a potential proteomic-based classification of APL patients that may be useful for risk stratification and therapeutic guidance.

Enhancing macrophage microbicidal responses would combat this problem but is limited by our understanding of how alveolar macrophages (AMs) kill bacteria. Objectives: To define the role and mechanism of AM apoptosis-associated bacterial killing in the lung. Methods: We generated a unique CD68.hMcl-1 transgenic mouse with macrophage-specific overexpression of the human antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein, a factor upregulated in AMs from patients at increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia, to address the requirement for apoptosis-associated killing. Measurements and Main Results: Wild-type and transgenic macrophages demonstrated comparable ingestion and initial phagolysosomal killing of bacteria. Continued ingestion (for >/=12 h) overwhelmed initial killing, and a second, late-phase microbicidal response killed viable bacteria in wild-type macrophages, but this response was blunted in CD68.hMcl-1 transgenic macrophages. The late phase of bacterial killing required both caspase-induced generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, the peak generation of which coincided with the late phase of killing. The CD68.hMcl-1 transgene prevented mitochondrial reactive oxygen species but not nitric oxide generation. Apoptosis-associated killing enhanced pulmonary clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in wild-type mice but not CD68.hMcl-1 transgenic mice. Bacterial clearance was enhanced in vivo in CD68.hMcl-1 transgenic mice by reconstitution of apoptosis with BH3 mimetics or clodronate-encapsulated liposomes. Apoptosis-associated killing was not activated during Staphylococcus aureus lung infection. Conclusions: Mcl-1 upregulation prevents macrophage apoptosis-associated killing and establishes that apoptosis-associated killing is required to allow AMs to clear ingested bacteria. Engagement of macrophage apoptosis should be investigated as a novel, host-based antimicrobial strategy.","['Preston, Julie A', 'Bewley, Martin A', 'Marriott, Helen M', 'McGarry Houghton, A', 'Mohasin, Mohammed', 'Jubrail, Jamil', 'Morris, Lucy', 'Stephenson, Yvonne L', 'Cross, Simon', 'Greaves, David R', 'Craig, Ruth W', 'van Rooijen, Nico', 'Bingle, Colin D', 'Read, Robert C', 'Mitchell, Timothy J', 'Whyte, Moira K B', 'Shapiro, Steven D', 'Dockrell, David H']","['Preston JA', 'Bewley MA', 'Marriott HM', 'McGarry Houghton A', 'Mohasin M', 'Jubrail J', 'Morris L', 'Stephenson YL', 'Cross S', 'Greaves DR', 'Craig RW', 'van Rooijen N', 'Bingle CD', 'Read RC', 'Mitchell TJ', 'Whyte MKB', 'Shapiro SD', 'Dockrell DH']","['1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '3 Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and.', '4 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', '5 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', '6 MRC Centre for Inflammation Research.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '7 Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '8 Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', '9 Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geissel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.', '10 Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', '1 The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions and.', '2 Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '11 University of Southampton Medical School, Southampton, United Kingdom.', '12 National Institute for Health Research Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, Southampton, United Kingdom.', '13 Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;

Intensive research efforts have been directed to mass spectrometry (MS)-based qualitative and quantitative glycomic analysis due to the important functions of glycans. Among various strategies, isobaric labeling has become popular because of its higher multiplexing capacity. Over the past few years, several isobaric chemical tags have been developed for quantitative glycomics. However, caveats also exist for these tags, such as relatively low reporter ion yield for aminoxyTMT-labeled complex glycans. To overcome the limitations of existing isobaric chemical tags, we designed a class of novel isobaric multiplex reagents for carbonyl-containing compound (SUGAR) tags that can be used to label glycans for quantitative glycomic analysis. The quantitative performance including labeling efficiency, quantification accuracy, and dynamic range of these SUGAR tags has been evaluated, showing promising results. Finally, the 4-plex SUGAR tags have been utilized to investigate N-glycan changes of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) pediatric patients before and after chemotherapy.","['Feng, Yu', 'Chen, Bingming', 'Yu, Qinying', 'Zhong, Xuefei', 'Frost, Dustin C', 'Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy', 'Li, Lingjun']","['Feng Y', 'Chen B', 'Yu Q', 'Zhong X', 'Frost DC', 'Ikonomidou C', 'Li L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190204,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,PMC6436950,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/08/15 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05757 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2019 Feb 19;91(4):3141-3146. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05757.

Traditional immunomagnetic cell capture suffers from suboptimal sensitivity, specificity, and time- and cost-effectiveness. Mimicking the features of octopuses, a device termed a ""NanoOctopus"" was developed for cancer cell isolation in whole blood. The device consists of long multimerized aptamer DNA strands, or tentacle DNA, immobilized on magnetic microparticle surfaces. Their ultrahigh sensitivity and specificity are attributed to multivalent binding of the tentacle DNA to cell receptors without steric hindrance. The simple, quick, and noninvasive capture and release of the target cells allows for extensive downstream cellular and molecular analysis, and the time- and cost-effectiveness of fabrication and regeneration of the devices makes them attractive for industrial manufacture.","['Chen, Yongli', 'Tyagi, Deependra', 'Lyu, Mingsheng', 'Carrier, Andrew J', 'Nganou, Collins', 'Youden, Brian', 'Wang, Wei', 'Cui, Shufen', 'Servos, Mark', 'Oakes, Ken', 'He, Shengnan', 'Zhang, Xu']","['Chen Y', 'Tyagi D', 'Lyu M', 'Carrier AJ', 'Nganou C', 'Youden B', 'Wang W', 'Cui S', 'Servos M', 'Oakes K', 'He S', 'Zhang X']","['Marine School , Huaihai Institute of Technology , Lianungang , 222005 , China.', 'Department of Biology , University of Waterloo , Waterloo , Ontario N2L 3G1 , Canada.', ""Institute of Translational Medicine , Shenzhen Second People's Hospital , First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Health Science Center, Shenzhen , 518055 , China."", 'Department of Biology , University of Waterloo , Waterloo , Ontario N2L 3G1 , Canada.', ""Institute of Translational Medicine , Shenzhen Second People's Hospital , First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Health Science Center, Shenzhen , 518055 , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190227,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,,2019/01/17 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05432 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2019 Mar 19;91(6):4017-4022. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05432.
