Its analog, cyclosporin H (CsH), lacks immunosuppressive function but can act as an antagonist for the human formyl peptide receptor (FPR). More recent studies have shown that CsA also inhibits fMLF-induced degranulation in differentiated HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. However, it is unclear whether CsA interferes with ligand-receptor interaction, G protein activation, or other downstream signaling events. In this study we used human neutrophils, differentiated HL-60 cells, and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing human FPR (RBL-FPR) to identify the action site of CsA. In functional assays, CsA inhibited fMLF-stimulated degranulation, chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, and phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK 1/2 and the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt. CsA also blocked Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met (WKYMVm)-induced functions in RBL-FPR cells. Concentrations for half-maximal inhibition with CsA are generally 6- to 50-fold higher than that of CsH. CsA was compared with another immunosuppressant, ascomycin, relative to the inhibitory effects on FPR-mediated chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, and degranulation. In these experiments, ascomycin produced no inhibitory effects at low micromolar concentrations (1-4 microM), whereas the inhibitory effects of CsA were prominent at comparable concentrations. Finally, CsA dose-dependently inhibited the uptake of fNle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluoresceine and [3H]fMLF or [125I]WKYMVm binding to FPR. However, CsA and CsH did not show any obvious inhibitory effect on FPR-like 1-mediated cellular functions. These results demonstrate that CsA is a selective antagonist of FPR and that its inhibition of fMLF-stimulated leukocyte activation is at the level of cognate ligand binding.","['Yan, Pangke', 'Nanamori, Masakatsu', 'Sun, Meiling', 'Zhou, Caihong', 'Cheng, Ni', 'Li, Na', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Xiao, Lihua', 'Xie, Xin', 'Ye, Richard D', 'Wang, Ming-Wei']","['Yan P', 'Nanamori M', 'Sun M', 'Zhou C', 'Cheng N', 'Li N', 'Zheng W', 'Xiao L', 'Xie X', 'Ye RD', 'Wang MW']","['National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'AUF4U5NSJK (immunomycin)', 'FUO6O3NDNH (cyclosporin H)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects/immunology', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/immunology', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Neutrophil Activation/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tacrolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2006/11/04 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/10/7050 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.7050 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Nov 15;177(10):7050-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.7050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated expression and functions of CXCL13/CXCR5 and CCL19/CCR7 in CD23+CD5+ and CD23+CD5- B cells from cord blood (CB) and patients with B cell lineage acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL or B-CLL). CXCR5 and CCR7 are selectively expressed on B-ALL, B-CLL, and CB CD23+CD5+ B cells at high frequency, but not on CD23+CD5- B cells. Although no significant chemotactic responsiveness was observed, CXCL13 and CCL19 cooperatively induce significant resistance to TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis in B-ALL and B-CLL CD23+CD5+ B cells, but not in the cells from CB. B-ALL and B-CLL CD23+CD5+ B cells express elevated levels of paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10). CXCL13 and CCL19 together significantly up-regulate PEG10 expression in the same cells. We have found that CXCL13 and CCL19 together by means of activation of CXCR5 and CCR7 up-regulate PEG10 expression and function, subsequently stabilize caspase-3 and caspase-8 in B-ALL and B-CLL CD23+CD5+ B cells, and further rescue the cells from TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, we suggest that normal lymphocytes, especially naive B and T cells, use CXCL13/CXCR5 and CCL19/CCR7 for migration, homing, maturation, and cell homeostasis as well as secondary lymphoid tissues organogenesis. In addition, certain malignant cells take advantages of CXCL13/CXCR5 and CCL19/CCR7 for infiltration, resistance to apoptosis, and inappropriate proliferation.","['Chunsong, Hu', 'Yuling, He', 'Li, Wang', 'Jie, Xiong', 'Gang, Zhou', 'Qiuping, Zhang', 'Qingping, Gao', 'Kejian, Zhang', 'Li, Qiao', 'Chang, Alfred E', 'Youxin, Jin', 'Jinquan, Tan']","['Chunsong H', 'Yuling H', 'Li W', 'Jie X', 'Gang Z', 'Qiuping Z', 'Qingping G', 'Kejian Z', 'Li Q', 'Chang AE', 'Youxin J', 'Jinquan T']","['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CCL19 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CXCL13 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL13)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PEG10 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Chemokine CCL19', 'Chemokine CXCL13', 'Chemokines, CC/*physiology', 'Chemokines, CXC/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, CXCR5', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis']",2006/11/04 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/10/6713 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.6713 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Nov 15;177(10):6713-22. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.6713.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain insight into the molecular function of the RER, we studied its signal transduction mechanisms. Initially, we found a ubiquitous and intracellular expression pattern of the human RER. Consistently, we observed several transcriptional start sites and a high promoter activity of the human RER. We could identify the transcription factor promyelocytic zinc finger (PLZF) protein as a direct protein interaction partner of the C-terminal domain of the RER by yeast 2-hybrid screening and coimmunoprecipitation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments also indicated homodimerization of the RER. On activation of the RER by renin, PLZF is translocated into the nucleus and represses transcription of the RER itself, thereby creating a very short negative feedback loop, but activates transcription of the p85alpha subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K-p85alpha). Small interfering RNA against the RER abolished these effects. A PLZF cis-element in the RER promoter was identified by site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. Renin stimulation caused a 6-fold recruitment of PLZF to this promoter region as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, renin stimulation of rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts induced an increase of cell number and a decrease of apoptosis. These effects were partly abolished by PI3K inhibition and completely abrogated by small interfering RNA against PLZF. Finally, experiments in PLZF knockout mice confirmed the role of PLZF as an upstream regulator of RER and PI3K-p85alpha. Our data demonstrate the existence of a novel signal transduction pathway involving the ligand renin, RER, and the transcription factor PLZF, which is of physiological and putative pathophysiological relevance.","['Schefe, Jan H', 'Menk, Mario', 'Reinemund, Jana', 'Effertz, Karin', 'Hobbs, Robin M', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Ruiz, Patricia', 'Unger, Thomas', 'Funke-Kaiser, Heiko']","['Schefe JH', 'Menk M', 'Reinemund J', 'Effertz K', 'Hobbs RM', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Ruiz P', 'Unger T', 'Funke-Kaiser H']","['Center for Cardiovascular Research/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Hessische Strasse 3-4, 10115 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (ATP6AP2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/physiology', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Renin/metabolism', 'Renin-Angiotensin System/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/*genetics/*metabolism']",2006/11/04 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.RES.0000251700.00994.0d [pii]', '10.1161/01.RES.0000251700.00994.0d [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2006 Dec 8;99(12):1355-66. doi: 10.1161/01.RES.0000251700.00994.0d.

However, the role of Pbx1 for adrenal growth and function in the adult organism together with the molecular relationship between Pbx1 and these other transcription factors have not been characterized. We demonstrate that Pbx haploinsufficiency (Pbx1(+/-)) in mice is accompanied by a significant lower adrenal weight in adult animals compared with wild-type controls. Accordingly, baseline proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels are lower in Pbx1(+/-) mice, and unilateral adrenalectomy results in impaired contralateral compensatory adrenal growth, indicating a lower proliferative potential in the context of Pbx1 haploinsufficiency. In accordance with the key role of IGFs in adrenocortical proliferation and development, real-time RT-PCR demonstrates significant lower expression levels of the IGF-I receptor, and up-regulation of IGF binding protein-2. Functionally, Pbx1(+/-) mice display a blunted corticosterone response after ACTH stimulation coincident with lower adrenal expression of the ACTH receptor (melanocortin 2 receptor, Mc2-r). Mechanistically, in vitro studies reveal that Pbx1 and Sf-1 synergistically stimulates Mc2-r promoter activity. Moreover, Sf-1 directly activates the Pbx1 promoter activity in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for a role of Pbx1 in the maintenance of a functional adrenal cortex mediated by synergistic actions of Pbx1 and Sf-1 in the transcriptional regulation of the critical effector of adrenocortical differentiation, the ACTH receptor.","['Lichtenauer, Urs D', 'Duchniewicz, Marlena', 'Kolanczyk, Mateusz', 'Hoeflich, Andreas', 'Hahner, Stephanie', 'Else, Tobias', 'Bicknell, Andrew B', 'Zemojtel, Tomasz', 'Stallings, Nancy R', 'Schulte, Dominik M', 'Kamps, Mark P', 'Hammer, Gary D', 'Scheele, Jurgen S', 'Beuschlein, Felix']","['Lichtenauer UD', 'Duchniewicz M', 'Kolanczyk M', 'Hoeflich A', 'Hahner S', 'Else T', 'Bicknell AB', 'Zemojtel T', 'Stallings NR', 'Schulte DM', 'Kamps MP', 'Hammer GD', 'Scheele JS', 'Beuschlein F']","['Division of Endocrine Research, Department of Medicine Innenstadt, University Hospital Munich, Ziemssenstrasse 1, D-80336 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Corticotropin)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '0 (Steroidogenic Factor 1)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (steroidogenic factor 1, mouse)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex/drug effects/*growth & development/pathology', 'Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Adrenal Glands/metabolism', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Corticosterone/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression', 'Haplotypes', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hypertrophy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Corticotropin/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Somatomedins/metabolism', 'Steroidogenic Factor 1', 'Steroids/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2006/11/04 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2006-0681 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2006-0681 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2007 Feb;148(2):693-704. doi: 10.1210/en.2006-0681.

Apart from limitations in their numbers, spermatogonial stem cells may also be contaminated by malignant cells. Therefore, both enrichment and decontamination before transplantation may be necessary. This study aimed at evaluating the decontaminating potential of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for both murine and human testicular cell suspensions. In the mouse, the effectiveness of the transplantation technique after cell sorting was also assessed. METHODS: Murine testicular cells were contaminated with 5% EL4 cells. Fresh and frozen-thawed suspensions were sorted using MACS (CD49f (+)) and FACS (CD49f(+), H-2Kb(-)) and evaluated by FACS, cell culture and transplantation into W/W(v) mice. Human testicular cells were contaminated with 5 or 0.05% CCRF-SB (SB) cells. Frozen-thawed suspensions were sorted using FACS (HLA class I(-)) and evaluated by FACS, cell culture and PCR for the B-cell receptor. RESULTS: In the mouse, the sorted fractions contained 0.39% H-2K(b)-positive and 76.55% CD49f-positive cells. After transplantation, 1 in 20 recipient mice developed a malignancy. In the human experiments, an average of 0.58% SB cells was detected after sorting. In only 1 of 11 samples, there were no SB cells observed. CONCLUSION: MACS and/or FACS are insufficient for completely depleting testicular tissue of malignant cells. Although more research on alternative decontamination techniques is necessary, developing a reliable method to screen a priori testicular tissue for malignant cells may be equally important.","['Geens, M', 'Van de Velde, H', 'De Block, G', 'Goossens, E', 'Van Steirteghem, A', 'Tournaye, H']","['Geens M', 'Van de Velde H', 'De Block G', 'Goossens E', 'Van Steirteghem A', 'Tournaye H']","['Research Centre for Reproduction and Genetics, University Hospital and Medical School, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. mieke.geens@az.vub.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/methods', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Magnetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Testis/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/11/04 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['del418 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/del418 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2007 Mar;22(3):733-42. doi: 10.1093/humrep/del418.

In these patients, intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation are the only curative treatment approaches, while non-curative options include low-dose chemotherapy or best supportive care alone. The basis for treatment decision-making in this clinically and biologically heterogeneous group is not well defined. DESIGN AND METHODS: In order to investigate treatment stratification patterns and outcomes in this population, we performed a systematic literature search in MedLine for relevant clinical reports published between 1989 and 2006. Only large population-based investigations and publications of clinical trials with more than 40 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: In 36 AML studies involving a total of 12,370 patients (median age 70 years) median overall survival approached 30 weeks for intensively treated patients. In patients receiving best supportive care alone, or best supportive care plus non-intensive treatment, median overall survival was 7.5 and 12 weeks, respectively. The complete remission rate after induction was 44%, and in those patients who achieved complete remission age no longer influenced prognosis. In 18 large studies approximately 50% of AML patients received induction therapy, 30% non-intensive chemotherapy and 20% supportive care only. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Due to the scarcity of randomized AML/MDS trials in which older patients are assigned to either induction or less intense therapy, predictors to identify older patients most likely to benefit from intensive therapy and novel tools to optimize (or even standardize) recommendations are needed. We propose that in this patient population in the future, geriatric assessment instruments and comorbidity scoring are implemented in treatment decision-making.","['Deschler, Barbara', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Mertelsmann, Roland', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Deschler B', 'de Witte T', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology Oncology, University of Freiburg Hugstetterstr. 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*therapy', '*Problem Solving', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/11/04 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Nov;91(11):1513-22.,,,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daxx, a transcriptional corepressor, was reported to repress the transcriptional potential of several transcription factors and target to PML oncogenic domains (PODs) via SUMO-dependent interactions. The mechanism by which Daxx binds to sumoylated factors mediating transcriptional and subnuclear compartmental regulation remains unclear. Here, we define a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) within Daxx and show it to be crucial for targeting Daxx to PODs and for transrepression of several sumoylated transcription factors, including glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In addition, the capability of Daxx SIM to bind SUMO also controls Daxx sumoylation. We further demonstrate that arsenic trioxide-induced sumoylation of PML correlates with a change of endogenous Daxx partitioning from GR-regulated gene promoter to PODs and a relief of Daxx repression on GR target gene expression. Our results provide mechanistic insights into Daxx in SUMO-dependent transcriptional control and subnuclear compartmentalization.","['Lin, Ding-Yen', 'Huang, Yen-Sung', 'Jeng, Jen-Chong', 'Kuo, Hong-Yi', 'Chang, Che-Chang', 'Chao, Ting-Ting', 'Ho, Chun-Chen', 'Chen, Yun-Ching', 'Lin, Tong-Ping', 'Fang, Hsin-I', 'Hung, Chih-Chang', 'Suen, Ching-Shu', 'Hwang, Ming-Jing', 'Chang, Kun-Sang', 'Maul, Gerd G', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming']","['Lin DY', 'Huang YS', 'Jeng JC', 'Kuo HY', 'Chang CC', 'Chao TT', 'Ho CC', 'Chen YC', 'Lin TP', 'Fang HI', 'Hung CC', 'Suen CS', 'Hwang MJ', 'Chang KS', 'Maul GG', 'Shih HM']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2006/11/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(06)00709-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2006.10.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2006 Nov 3;24(3):341-54. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2006.10.019.,,,['EX95-9529NI/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of both the enzymes varies among ALL patients governing the active and the inactive metabolite profile within the immature lymphocytes. Therefore, an attempt was made to study the kinetic nature of the branched bi-enzyme system acting on 6MP and to quantitate TIMP and 6TUA formed when the two enzymes are present in equal and variable ratios. The quantification of the branched kinetics using spectrophotometric method presents problem due to the closely apposed lambda(max) of the substrates and products. Hence, employing an HPLC method, the quantification of the products was done with the progress of time. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of substrate was found to be 10nM and for products as 50 nM. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 1 nM for the substrate and the products. The method exhibited linearity in the range of 0.01-100 microM for 6MP and 0.05-100 microM for both 6TUA and TIMP. The amount of TIMP formed was higher than that of 6TUA in the bi-enzyme system when both the enzymes were present in equivalent enzymatic ratio.

Additional risk stratification is provided by analysis of the IN VITRO and IN VIVO response of the blasts towards standard chemotherapy. Despite adapted therapies, a number of children with good and bad prognostic factors still fail therapy. One approach to this problem might be to incorporate monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) as additional modalities into the first or second line treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to identify target antigen structures, we analyzed the immunological expression profiles of blasts from 181 patients with B-cell precursor ALL treated at our institution in 11 years according to the CoALL-92/97/03 protocols. Blasts were classified according to the EGIL guidelines as 9 proB-, 110 common (c-) and 62 preB-ALL. RESULTS: > 99 and 96 % of patients expressed CD19 and CD22 on > 90 % of their blasts, respectively. HLA-DR on > 95 % blasts was present in all patients. CD10 was expressed on all c-/preB-ALL and absent on proB-ALL cells. CD20 was expressed on 11-37 % of B-cell precursor ALL samples. CD34 positive blasts were found in 89, 83 and 68 % of patients with proB-, c- and preB-ALL, respectively. CD37 expression was detected in 0-18 % of patients. < 20 % CD45(+) blasts were found in 11, 19 and 18 % of patients with proB-, c- and preB-ALL. CD33(+) was expressed on 33, 29 and 21 % of patients samples with proB-, c- and preB-ALL. Other myeloid antigens (CD13, CD14, CD15, CD65) were positive on blasts in < 25 % of patients. Analyses of the immunological profile of blasts in 9 consecutive children with relapse revealed that the antigen expression profile varied little compared to the initial diagnosis for CD10, CD19, CD22 and HLA-DR. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses clearly identified the three antigens CD19, CD22 and HLA-DR present on blasts in more than 90 % of patients as potential target structures for targeted therapies with native or toxin-bound monoclonal antibodies in childhood ALL.","['Gudowius, S', 'Recker, K', 'Laws, H-J', 'Dirksen, U', 'Troger, A', 'Wieczorek, U', 'Furlan, S', 'Gobel, U', 'Hanenberg, H']","['Gudowius S', 'Recker K', 'Laws HJ', 'Dirksen U', 'Troger A', 'Wieczorek U', 'Furlan S', 'Gobel U', 'Hanenberg H']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, Children's Hospital, UKD, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/*analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*analysis']",2006/11/03 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2006/11/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2006-942273 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2006 Nov-Dec;218(6):327-33. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-942273.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, testicular teratomas of infancy are generally benign. Accordingly, prepubertal teratomas show no cytogenetic or molecular genetic aberrations. In contrast, postpubertal testicular teratomas can present as clinically malignant tumors and may show complex cytogenetic aberrations such as the isochromosome 12p, which is pathognomonic of malignant germ cell tumors. Notably, teratomas of both age groups show an at least partial erasure of the genomic imprinting, correlating with their origin from primordial germ cells. The Kiel Pediatric Tumor Registry includes 541 teratoma specimens, and among these, the most frequent tumor sites (in descending order) are: the sacrococcygeal region (33.8 %), the ovaries (31.2 %) and the testes (10.5 %). Rare localizations include the mediastinum, the retroperitoneum, the head and neck region as well as the central nervous system. The WHO classification of germ cell tumors distinguishes mature and immature teratomas as well as teratomas with malignant transformation. In immature teratomas, primitive neuroectodermal structures predominate. According to the grading system (Gonzalez-Crussi, 1982), mature teratomas (G0) are more frequent (54.5 %) than immature teratomas (G1-G3, 45.5 %). Only 7.8 % of all teratomas show the highest grade of immaturity (G3). The frequency of additional microscopic foci of malignant yolk sac tumor correlates with the grade of immaturity. In sacrococcygeal teratomas, the yolk sac tumor microfoci may give rise to a malignant relapse after incomplete resection. The rare teratomas with malignant transformation contain components with ""conventional"" somatic type malignancy such as leukaemia, carcinoma or sarcoma. Here, molecular genetic analysis has demonstrated the origin of the somatic malignancy from a malignant transformation within the germ cell tumor with retention of the cytogenetic changes characteristic of malignant germ cell tumors.","['Harms, D', 'Zahn, S', 'Gobel, U', 'Schneider, D T']","['Harms D', 'Zahn S', 'Gobel U', 'Schneider DT']","['Kiel Pediatric Tumor Registry, Institute of Pathology, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Endodermal Sinus Tumor/epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Ovary/pathology', 'Puberty', '*Registries', '*Teratoma/classification/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', '*Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Testis/pathology']",2006/11/03 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2006/11/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2006-942271 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2006 Nov-Dec;218(6):296-302. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-942271.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We included 21 patients with lymphoma, 14 with multiple myeloma (MM), 14 with acute leukemia, 13 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 25 healthy control subjects into our study. The subjects' body mass indexes (BMI) were calculated; hematological and acute phase response parameters, serum lipid were determined; serum leptin and resistin levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum leptin level was significantly increased in CLL and MM groups when compared to the control group (p less, similar 0.01). Resistin level was significantly higher in lymphoma patients than in CLL, acute leukemia and control groups (p less, similar 0.01). In the control group, leptin level was negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (r = -0.44, p = 0.047); and in all patients with hematologic malignancies, leptin level was correlated with BMI (r = 0.32, p = 0.02). Leptin in lymphoma subjects correlated with hemoglobin level (r = 0.64, p = 0.005), resistin level correlated with the platelet count in patients with hematologic malignancies (r = 0.26, p = 0.044). In addition, leptin level had negative correlations with international prognostic score (IPS) in Hodgkin lymphoma (r = -0.9, p = 0.002) and with international prognostic index (IPI) in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r = -0.77, p = 0.03). In CLL patients, leptin level had a correlation with the poor prognostic marker - CD38 level (r = 0.68, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: We found higher leptin levels in MM and CLL patients, and higher resistin levels in lymphoma patients: this fact demonstrates that changes in adipose tissue and metabolism occur in these disease states.","['Pamuk, G E', 'Demir, M', 'Harmandar, F', 'Yesil, Y', 'Turgut, B', 'Vural, O']","['Pamuk GE', 'Demir M', 'Harmandar F', 'Yesil Y', 'Turgut B', 'Vural O']","['Department of Hematology, Trakya University Medical Faculty, Edirne, Turkey. gepamuk@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Leptin)', '0 (Resistin)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*blood/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Resistin/*blood/metabolism']",2006/11/03 09:00,2007/01/12 09:00,['2006/11/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['28/534 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2006 Sep;28(3):241-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA hypermethylation has been identified as a mechanism of ARLTS1 expression down-regulation in lung carcinomas and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We found that, in the majority of ovarian carcinomas (61.5%) and in a significant proportion of ovarian and breast cancer cell lines (45%), ARLTS1 is strongly down-regulated due to DNA methylation in its promoter region. After ARLTS1 restoration by adenoviral transduction, only the negative TOV-112 and the homozygously mutated (MUT) MCF7 cells, but not the OV-90 cells expressing a normal ARLTS1 product, underwent apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, ARLTS1 reexpression significantly reduced the tumorigenic potential of TOV-112 in nude mice. On the contrary, the ARLTS1-MUT induced significantly lower levels of apoptosis in infected cells and reduced in vivo tumorigenesis only partially, supporting the hypothesis that Trp149Stop polymorphism is retained in the general population and predisposes to cancer because of a reduction, but not full loss, of normal ARLTS1 function.","['Petrocca, Fabio', 'Iliopoulos, Dimitrios', 'Qin, Haiyan R', 'Nicoloso, Milena S', 'Yendamuri, Say', 'Wojcik, Sylwia E', 'Shimizu, Masayoshi', 'Di Leva, Gianpiero', 'Vecchione, Andrea', 'Trapasso, Francesco', 'Godwin, Andrew K', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Calin, George A', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Petrocca F', 'Iliopoulos D', 'Qin HR', 'Nicoloso MS', 'Yendamuri S', 'Wojcik SE', 'Shimizu M', 'Di Leva G', 'Vecchione A', 'Trapasso F', 'Godwin AK', 'Negrini M', 'Calin GA', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ARL11 protein, human)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factors/*genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",2006/11/03 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/21/10287 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2289 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Nov 1;66(21):10287-91. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2289.,,['Cancer Res. 2007 May 1;67(9):4533; author reply 4534.

The exact mechanisms for the suppression, however, are not completely understood. To elucidate further the barriers against HIV-1 replication in mouse cells, we analyzed the replication of the virus in lymphocytes from human CD4/CXCR4 transgenic mice. Although primary splenocytes and thymocytes allowed the entry and reverse transcription of HIV-1, the integration efficiency of the viral DNA was greatly reduced in these cells relative to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting an additional block(s) before or at the point of host chromosome integration of the viral DNA. Preintegration processes were further analyzed using HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses. The reverse transcription step of HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope of murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein was efficiently supported in both human and mouse cells, but nuclear import of the preintegration complex (PIC) of HIV-1 was blocked in mouse cells. We found that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled HIV-1 integrase, which is known to be important in the nuclear localization of the PIC, could not be imported into the nucleus of mouse cells, in contrast to human cells. On the other hand, GFP-Vpr localized exclusively to the nuclei of both mouse and human cells. These observations suggest that, due to the dysfunction of integrase, the nuclear localization of PIC is suppressed in mouse cells.","['Tsurutani, Naomi', 'Yasuda, Jiro', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Choi, Byung-Il', 'Kadoki, Motohiko', 'Iwakura, Yoichiro']","['Tsurutani N', 'Yasuda J', 'Yamamoto N', 'Choi BI', 'Kadoki M', 'Iwakura Y']","['Center for Experimental Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)']",IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV Integrase/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Replication']",2006/11/03 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/11/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00870-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00870-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jan;81(2):677-88. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00870-06.

Transcription elements within the long terminal repeats (LTR) are prime determinants of cell lineage specificity; however, the influence of other factors, including the Env protein that modulates cell tropism through receptor recognition, has not been rigorously addressed. The ability of 10A1-MuLV to use both PiT1 and PiT2 receptors has been implicated in its induction of blast cell leukemia. Here we show that restricting receptor usage of 10A1-MuLV to PiT2 results in loss of blast cell transformation capacity. However, the pathogenicity was unaltered when the env gene is exchanged with Moloney MuLV, which uses the Cat1 receptor. Significantly, the leukemic blasts express erythroid markers and consistently contain proviral integrations in the Fli1 locus, a target of Friend MuLV (F-MuLV) during erythroleukemia induction. Furthermore, an NB-tropic variant of 10A1 was unable to induce blast cell leukemia in C57BL/6 mice, which are also resistant to F-MuLV transformation. We propose that 10A1- and F-MuLV actually induce identical (erythro)blastic leukemia by a mechanism involving Fli1 activation and cooperation with inherent genetic mutations in susceptible mouse strains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deletion of the Icsbp tumor suppressor gene in C57BL/6 mice is sufficient to confer susceptibility to 10A1-MuLV leukemia induction but with altered specificity. In summary, we validate the significance of the env gene in leukemia specificity and underline the importance of a complex interplay of cooperating oncogenes and/or tumor suppressors in determining the pathogenicity of MuLV variants.","['Rodenburg, Michaela', 'Fischer, Meike', 'Engelmann, Afra', 'Harbers, Stephanie O', 'Ziegler, Marion', 'Lohler, Jurgen', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Rodenburg M', 'Fischer M', 'Engelmann A', 'Harbers SO', 'Ziegler M', 'Lohler J', 'Stocking C']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/virology', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/virology']",2006/11/03 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/11/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01430-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01430-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jan;81(2):732-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01430-06.

Regarding HIV replication, the importance of cell contacts has been demonstrated, but this phenomenon remains only partly characterized. In order to alter cell-to-cell HIV transmission, we have maintained cultures under continuous gentle shaking and followed viral replication in this experimental system. In lymphoid cell lines, as well as in primary lymphocytes, viral replication was dramatically reduced in shaken cultures. To document this phenomenon, we have developed an assay to assess the relative contributions of free and cell-associated virions in HIV propagation. Acutely infected donor cells were mixed with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-labeled lymphocytes as targets, and viral production was followed by measuring HIV Gag expression at different time points by flow cytometry. We report that cellular contacts drastically enhance productive viral transfer compared to what is seen with infection with free virus. Productive cell-to-cell viral transmission required fusogenic viral envelope glycoproteins on donor cells and adequate receptors on targets. Only a few syncytia were observed in this coculture system. Virus release from donor cells was unaffected when cultures were gently shaken, whereas virus transfer to recipient cells was severely impaired. Altogether, these results indicate that cell-to-cell transfer is the predominant mode of HIV spread and help to explain why this virus replicates so efficiently in lymphoid organs.","['Sourisseau, Marion', 'Sol-Foulon, Nathalie', 'Porrot, Francoise', 'Blanchet, Fabien', 'Schwartz, Olivier']","['Sourisseau M', 'Sol-Foulon N', 'Porrot F', 'Blanchet F', 'Schwartz O']","['Groupe Virus et Immunite, URA CNRS 1930, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Giant Cells/physiology', 'HIV Infections/transmission/virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*virology', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virology/methods', '*Virus Replication']",2006/11/03 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/11/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01629-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01629-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jan;81(2):1000-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01629-06.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial included 211 LGM patients admitted to Hematological Research Center in 1990-1996 from other hospitals without random selection. The patients were examined by the standard program including biopsy of the affected organ or lymph node, bilateral trephine biopsy. Splenectomy was performed in 17 patients, 83 patients received PCT in other hospitals, 128 untreated patients received MOPP-ABVD therapy (3 courses of MOPP and 3 courses of ABVD). Forty one patients had defects in PCT, 16 of them rejected PCT and RT. The latter was performed 4 weeks after the 6th course, contraceptives were not prescribed to women. At LGM stage II-III RT was performed by the subradical program (no radiation to ilioinguinal lymph nodes) in doses 40-44 Gy on the foci and 32-36 Gy preventively, on massive and residual foci after PCT - 5-10 Gy additionally. RESULTS: Ten-year overall and recurrence-free survival in the untreated group reached 83 and 80%, respectively, for pretreated patients - 46 and 36%, respectively. Causes of death of 26 patients were LGM progression, infection (tuberculosis, as a rule), secondary tumors and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). After remission 25 women gave birth to a healthy child and 12 healthy children were born to 9 males. CONCLUSION: MOPP-ABVD plus radiotherapy program according to subradical and radical variants was in the past effective but invalidating rescue therapy.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether distress in older patients (aged 65 years and older) would be reduced with educational materials (EM) supplemented by monthly telephone monitoring (TM) (TM + EM) compared with the use of EM alone because of more timely referrals to appropriate health professionals. METHODS: One hundred ninety-two older patients with breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers who had advanced disease and currently were receiving treatment were randomized to receive either TM + EM or EM alone. One hundred thirty-one patients were evaluated by telephone interview for psychologic and physical distress and for social support at baseline and at 6 months using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-C30 quality-of-life questionnaire, and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey. Patients who in the TM + EM group were called monthly for 6 months to monitor their distress using the HADS and EORTC physical symptom items and the MOS Social Support Survey items, with cutoff levels were established to indicate which patients were in greater distress. Those patients who scored above the cutoff levels were referred to their oncology nurse for referral to the appropriate professional. Patients in the EM group received written materials regarding cancer-related psychosocial issues and available resources. RESULTS: At 6 months, patients in the TM + EM group reported significantly less anxiety (HADS; P < .0001), depression (HADS; P = .0004), and overall distress (HADS; P < .0001) compared with patients in the EM group. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly monitoring of older patients' distress with TM and EM along with referral for appropriate help was found to be an efficient means of reducing patients' anxiety and depression compared with patients who received only EM.","['Kornblith, Alice B', 'Dowell, Jeannette M', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Engelman, Beverly J', 'Bauer-Wu, Susan', 'Small, Eric J', 'Morrison, Vicki A', 'Atkins, James', 'Cohen, Harvey Jay', 'Holland, Jimmie C']","['Kornblith AB', 'Dowell JM', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Engelman BJ', 'Bauer-Wu S', 'Small EJ', 'Morrison VA', 'Atkins J', 'Cohen HJ', 'Holland JC']","['Breast Oncology Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. kornblith@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Breast Neoplasms/psychology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/psychology', 'Depression/etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/*therapy', 'Patient Education as Topic/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology/psychology/*therapy', '*Telephone']",2006/11/02 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22296 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Dec 1;107(11):2706-14. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22296.,,,"['C31946/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['(c) 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Few established cell lines of extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma (EES) have been reported, which made it difficult to examine the biological features of EES. Therefore, we have established a new clonal cell line of EES. We report its morphological characters, results of chromosomal and immunohistochemical analysis. A piece of tumor obtained from the 18-year-old female patient with EES was xenografted in a nude mouse. In vitro subcultured cells were then obtained from this xenograft. A clonal cell line was subsequently established by limiting dilution and designated EES1. EES1 cells had a doubling time of 24 hours. In the xenografted tumor, the cells expressed vimentin, CD99 (MIC2), neuron specific enolase (NSE) and cytokeratin. The original tumor cells also expressed vimentin, CD 99, and NSE, but was negative for cytokeratin. The morphological and immunohistochemical features of this cell line established, except for cytokeratin expression, were consistent with those of the primary tumor. Cytogenetic analysis of EES1 revealed chromosomal translocation of t(11; 12)(q24;ql2). The chimeric fusion of the Ewing's sarcoma gene in band 22q12 with the Friend leukemia virus integration-1 gene in band 11q24 was also demonstrated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization further confirmed the presence of translocation involving the Ewing's sarcoma gene in both the primary tumor and EES1 cells. In conclusion, we have established a human EES cell line EES1, which will provide a useful model for studying various aspects of human EES.","['Hatori, Masahito', 'Doi, Hideyuki', 'Watanabe, Mika', 'Sasano, Hironobu', 'Hosaka, Masami', 'Kotajima, Satoshi', 'Urano, Fumihiko', 'Hata, Junichi', 'Kokubun, Shoichi']","['Hatori M', 'Doi H', 'Watanabe M', 'Sasano H', 'Hosaka M', 'Kotajima S', 'Urano F', 'Hata J', 'Kokubun S']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan. mhato@mail.tains.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,['0 (Vimentin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",2006/11/02 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/tjem/210.221 [pii]', '10.1620/tjem.210.221 [doi]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2006 Nov;210(3):221-30. doi: 10.1620/tjem.210.221.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these clinical studies, CDDP was administered on day 1 and followed by a 5-d continuous infusion of 5-FU. However, it was repeatedly shown that the sequence of 5-FU followed by CDDP is more active and less toxic in tumor-bearing animals. Thus, the optimal administration schedule of CDDP and 5-FU against L1210 murine leukemia was examined and compared with that of the combination of 5-FU and carboplatin (JM-8). The combinations of 5-FU (days 1 to 5) and CDDP, given either on day 1 or on day 5, showed a similar level of antitumor activity and toxicity. On the other hand, the combinations of 5-FU (days 1 to 5) and JM-8 given on day 5 showed significantly higher antitumor activity and rather less toxicity, as compared with the combinations on the reverse sequence. Thus, the treatment sequence of platinum compounds followed by a 5-d continuous infusion of 5-FU in many clinical studies appears to be extremely favorable to CDDP than JM-8. In addition, pathological examinations of died mice showed that accumulation of ascites and pleural effusion was inhibited most effectively by JM-8, given alone or in combination with 5-FU. These results strongly suggest that the combination of 5-FU followed by JM-8 will be expected to show more excellent antitumor activity against human malignancies, and may be especially useful in patients who are unable to tolerate CDDP-related toxicity.","['Fujimoto, Shuichi']",['Fujimoto S'],"['Division of Chemotherapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan. sfujimot@chiba-cc.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Ascites/chemically induced', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Splenic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Survival Rate', 'Weight Loss/drug effects']",2006/11/02 09:00,2007/02/27 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/29.2260 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.29.2260 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2006 Nov;29(11):2260-6. doi: 10.1248/bpb.29.2260.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the details of the dose-response relationships, the expression of excess risk over time, and the modifying effects of other host and treatment factors have not been well defined. METHODS: Subsequent primary neoplasms of the CNS occurring within a cohort of 14,361 5-year survivors of childhood cancers were ascertained. Each patient was matched with four control subjects by age, sex, and time since original cancer diagnosis. Tumor site-specific radiation dosimetry was performed, and chemotherapy information was abstracted from medical records. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs), to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and to model the excess relative risk (ERR) as a function of radiation dose and host factors. For subsequent gliomas, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) were calculated based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. RESULTS: Subsequent CNS primary neoplasms were identified in 116 individuals. Gliomas (n = 40) occurred a median of 9 years from original diagnosis; for meningiomas (n = 66), it was 17 years. Radiation exposure was associated with increased risk of subsequent glioma (OR = 6.78, 95% CI = 1.54 to 29.7) and meningioma (OR = 9.94, 95% CI = 2.17 to 45.6). The dose response for the excess relative risk was linear (for glioma, slope = 0.33 [95% CI = 0.07 to 1.71] per Gy, and for meningioma, slope = 1.06 [95% CI = 0.21 to 8.15] per Gy). For glioma, the ERR/Gy was highest among children exposed at less than 5 years of age. After adjustment for radiation dose, neither original cancer diagnosis nor chemotherapy was associated with risk. The overall SIR for glioma was 8.7, and the EAR was 19.3 per 10,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to radiation therapy is the most important risk factor for the development of a new CNS tumor in survivors of childhood cancers. The higher risk of subsequent glioma in children irradiated at a very young age may reflect greater susceptibility of the developing brain to radiation.","['Neglia, Joseph P', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Liu, Yan', 'Packer, Roger J', 'Hammond, Sue', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Kasper, Catherine E', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Donaldson, Sarah S', 'Meadows, Anna T', 'Inskip, Peter D']","['Neglia JP', 'Robison LL', 'Stovall M', 'Liu Y', 'Packer RJ', 'Hammond S', 'Yasui Y', 'Kasper CE', 'Mertens AC', 'Donaldson SS', 'Meadows AT', 'Inskip PD']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis, MN, USA. jneglia@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brain/*drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Glioma/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Meningioma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Radiometry', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",2006/11/02 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['98/21/1528 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djj411 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Nov 1;98(21):1528-37. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djj411.,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Nov 1;98(21):1510-1.

In this study we report a potent synergistic effect of the combination of arsenic trioxide and interferon alpha (As/IFN-alpha) with emodin and DHA on cell-cycle arrest and cell death of HTLV-I-infected cells. Importantly, we found that clinically achievable doses of DHA and emodin allowed for reduced arsenic concentrations by 100-fold while still remaining highly toxic to tumor cells. Our data provide a rationale for combined use of As/IFN-alpha with emodin and DHA in patients with ATL refractory to conventional therapy.","['Brown, Megan', 'Bellon, Marcia', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Brown M', 'Bellon M', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Emodin/*pharmacology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*drug effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/11/02 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42009-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-04-015537 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 15;109(4):1653-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-04-015537.

Here, we demonstrate that simultaneous retinoid receptor ligation and blockade of the MEK/ERK signaling module, using the small-molecule inhibitor CI-1040, result in a strikingly synergistic induction of apoptosis in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells with constitutive ERK activation. This proapoptotic synergism requires functional RAR and RXR retinoid receptors, as demonstrated using RAR- and RXR-selective ligands and RAR-defective cells. In the presence of MEK inhibitors, however, retinoid-induced chromatin remodeling, target-gene transcription, and granulocytic differentiation are strikingly inhibited and apoptosis induction becomes independent of death-inducing ligand/receptor pairs; this suggests that apoptosis induction by combined retinoids and MEK inhibitors is entirely distinct from the classical ""postmaturation"" apoptosis induced by retinoids alone. Finally, we identify disruption of Bcl-2-dependent mitochondrial homeostasis as a possible point of convergence for the proapoptotic synergism observed with retinoids and MEK inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that combined retinoid treatment and MEK blockade exert powerful antileukemic effects and could be developed into a novel therapeutic strategy for both AML and APL.","['Milella, Michele', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Precupanu, Cristina M', 'Tabe, Yoko', 'Ricciardi, Maria Rosaria', 'Gregorj, Chiara', 'Collins, Steven J', 'Carter, Bing Z', ""D'Angelo, Carmen"", 'Petrucci, Maria Teresa', 'Foa, Robin', 'Cognetti, Francesco', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Milella M', 'Konopleva M', 'Precupanu CM', 'Tabe Y', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Gregorj C', 'Collins SJ', 'Carter BZ', ""D'Angelo C"", 'Petrucci MT', 'Foa R', 'Cognetti F', 'Tafuri A', 'Andreeff M']","['Division of Medical Oncology A, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy. milella@ifo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology']",2006/11/02 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41939-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-024679 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):2121-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-024679.

Defective ATM-mediated DNA damage responses underlie many aspects of the AT syndrome, but the basis for the immune deficiency has not been defined. ATM associates with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and some evidence suggests that ATM may regulate V(D)J recombination. However, it remains unclear how ATM loss compromises lymphocyte development in vivo. Here, we show that T-cell receptor beta (TCRbeta)-dependent proliferation and production of TCRbeta(low) CD4+CD8+ (DP) thymocytes occurred normally in Atm-/- mice. In striking contrast, the postmitotic maturation of TCRbeta(low) DP precursors into TCRbeta(int) DP cells and TCRbeta(hi) mature thymocytes was profoundly impaired. Furthermore, Atm-/- thymocytes expressed abnormally low amounts of TCRalpha mRNA and protein. These defects were not attributable to the induction of a BCL-2-sensitive apoptotic pathway. Rather, they were associated with frequent biallelic loss of distal Va gene segments in DP thymocytes, revealing that ATM maintains Tcra locus integrity as it undergoes V(D)J recombination. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ATM loss increases the frequency of aberrant Tcra deletion events, which compromise DP thymocyte maturation and likely promote the generation of oncogenic TCR translocations.","['Matei, Irina R', 'Gladdy, Rebecca A', 'Nutter, Lauryl M J', 'Canty, Angelo', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Danska, Jayne S']","['Matei IR', 'Gladdy RA', 'Nutter LM', 'Canty A', 'Guidos CJ', 'Danska JS']","['Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, University of Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Mice', 'Mitosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism']",2006/11/02 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41909-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-020917 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):1887-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-020917.

However, GC-resistance is a therapeutic problem with an unclear molecular mechanism. We generated approximately 70 GC-resistant sublines from a GC-sensitive B- and a T-ALL cell line and investigated their mechanisms of resistance. In response to GCs, all GC-resistant subclones analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed a deficient up-regulation of the GC-receptor (GR) and its downstream target, GC-induced leucine zipper. This deficiency in GR up-regulation was confirmed by Western blotting and on retroviral overexpression of GR in resistant subclones GC-sensitivity was restored. All GC-resistant subclones were screened for GR mutations using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC), DNA-fingerprinting, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Among the identified mutations were some previously not associated with GC resistance: A484D, P515H, L756N, Y663H, L680P, and R714W. This approach revealed three genotypes, complete loss of functional GR in the mismatch repair deficient T-ALL model, apparently normal GR genes in B-ALLs, and heterozygosity in both. In the first genotype, deficiency in GR up-regulation was fully explained by mutational events, in the second by a putative regulatory defect, and in the third by a combination thereof.

Knowledge of the signals controlling this important process remains vague. We have tested the idea that protein kinase C (PKC)theta, a member of the novel PKC (nPKC) family, which has been shown to play a preferential role in critical Th cell functions, plays a similar, preferential role in CTL lytic granule exocytosis using T acute lymphoblastic leukemia-104 (TALL-104) human leukemic CTLs as a model. We provide evidence consistent with the idea that PKC activity is important for the degranulation step of lytic granule exocytosis, as opposed to upstream events. In contrast with previous work, our results with pharmacological agents suggest that conventional PKCs (cPKCs) and nPKCs may participate. Our results suggest that stimulation with soluble agents that bypass the TCR and trigger granule exocytosis activates PKCalpha and PKCtheta, which can both accumulate at the site of contact with a target cell, although PKCtheta did so more often. Finally, using a novel assay that detects granule exocytosis specifically in transfected, viable cells, we find that overexpression of constitutively active mutants of PKCalpha or PKCtheta can synergize with increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] to promote granule exocytosis.

Conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier type 1 (SUMO-1) to lysines in the negative regulatory domain strongly suppresses its transcriptional activity. Here we report conjugation of two other members of the SUMO protein family, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, and provide evidence that this post-translational modification negatively affects transcriptional activity of c-Myb. Conjugation of SUMO-2/3 proteins is strongly enhanced by several different cellular stresses and occurs primarily on two lysines, Lys(523) and Lys(499). These lysines are in the negative regulatory domain of c-Myb and also serve as acceptor sites for SUMO-1. Stress-induced SUMO-2/3 conjugation is very rapid and independent of activation of stress-activated protein kinases of the SAPK and JNK families. PIAS-3 protein was identified as a new c-Myb-specific SUMO-E3 ligase that both catalyzes conjugation of SUMO-2/3 proteins to c-Myb and exerts a negative effect on c-Myb-induced reporter gene activation. Interestingly, co-expression of a SPRING finger mutant of PIAS-3 significantly suppresses SUMOylation of c-Myb under stress. These results argue that PIAS-3 SUMO-E3 ligase plays a critical role in stress-induced conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to c-Myb.

The country currently has a National Voluntary Control Programme but relatively few farms have enrolled. However, there is increased interest from authorities and farmers to implement regional compulsory programmes but there is scarce quantitative information of the transmission of BLV in cattle herds. This information is a prerequisite to develop effective BLV control strategies. Mathematical modelling offers ways of integrating population-level knowledge and epidemiological data to predict the outcomes of intervention scenarios. The purpose of the current paper is to gain understanding about the dynamics of the transmission of BLV in dairy herds from Argentina by simulation and to compare various BLV transmission models and select the one that is most appropriate. The hypothetical herd is conceptually described in terms of BLV status as a population of individuals that are protected by maternal antibodies (M), that are susceptible (S), that are in the latent period (E) or that are infectious (I). BLV is spread by horizontal and vertical transmission. We used an age-structured population model and within-herd transmission was simulated by Monte Carlo techniques. The next-generation approach has been used for the systematic computation of the basic reproduction ratio (R0). Parameter values for disease transmission were derived from previously published data; rates of entry, exit or transition between age groups were calculated based on our previous study, observational data, expert opinions and literature. With these parameter values the probability of a minor outbreak was estimated to be 10%, the probability of extinction was estimated as <0.001% and the expected time to extinction as more than 80 years. The probability of a minor outbreak and changes in prevalence were different when the index case was an adult cow compared to introduction by a heifer. Prediction of prevalences from MSI models fit the data satisfactorily. R0 was estimated as 9.5. The sensitivity analysis on R0 showed that all measures directed to reduce the transmission rate are potentially effective given operational control measures. An important prediction of these models is that, even in a relatively small, closed dairy herd, the time-scale for a BLV outbreak may be as long as several years and within-herd control of BLV requires intensive efforts.","['Monti, G E', 'Frankena, K', 'De Jong, M C M']","['Monti GE', 'Frankena K', 'De Jong MC']","['Wageningen University and Research Department of Animal Sciences, Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology Group, Marijkeweg, Wageningen, The Netherlands. gustavomonti@uachl.cl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Epidemiol Infect,Epidemiology and infection,8703737,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', '*Computer Simulation', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*transmission', '*Models, Biological', '*Monte Carlo Method', 'Prevalence']",2006/11/02 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0950268806007357 [pii]', '10.1017/S0950268806007357 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Infect. 2007 Jul;135(5):722-32. doi: 10.1017/S0950268806007357.

These assessments are commonly performed by study personnel and can be time-consuming. The purpose of this study was to assess whether patients were able to reliably assess their bleeding status on a daily basis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients admitted to hospital to receive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or to undergo allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant were included. Patients were given an introduction to a form for documenting the occurrence of 16 bleeding symptoms. Patients completed this form and were examined daily by a study assessor. A weekly health record review was also performed by a study assessor. The agreement between raters was determined by calculating the raw agreement, chance-corrected agreement, and chance-independent agreement. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed 458 assessment forms that were paired with 559 forms completed by a study assessor with 450 matched forms available for analysis (mean, 12.86 per patient). Agreement for most individual bleeding symptoms was high. Thirteen items had agreement greater than 90 percent and all items had agreement greater than 77 percent. The lowest agreement was seen for skin symptoms: petechiae (89.2%), purpura (80.9%), and ecchymosis (77.6%). The negative predictive value of patient self-assessment was high (range, 71.1%-100%) whereas the positive predictive value was lower (range, 0%-86.5%).

However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which have been developed to override imatinib resistance mechanisms such as overexpression of Bcr-Abl and point mutations within the Abl kinase domain, are currently competing. Inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinase are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP non-competitive inhibitors. Moreover, ATP-competitive inhibitors are fall into two subclasses, i.e. the Src/Abl inhibitors, and 2-phenylaminopyrimidin-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606 and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors while AMN107 and NS-187 (INNO-406) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Among these agents, clinical studies on dasatinib and AMN107 had started earlier than the others and favorable results are accumulating. Clinical studies of other compounds including NS-187 (INNO-406) will be performed in rapid succession. Because of its strong affinity, most ATP competitive inhibitors may be effective against imatinib-resistant patients. However, to date, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. To address this problem, ATP non-competitive inhibitors such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796 have been developed. It may be necessary for the improvement of CML and Ph(+)ALL treatment to be taken into consideration of the combination therapy with novel ATP-competitive inhibitors and these agents.","['Kimura, Shinya', 'Ashihara, Eishi', 'Maekawa, Taira']","['Kimura S', 'Ashihara E', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/11/02 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920106778521532 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 Oct;7(5):371-9. doi: 10.2174/138920106778521532.,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this approach, the majority of patients still die of their disease because of both treatment-related mortality and relapse. Recently, monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugates have been developed which potentially may increase the efficacy of treatment and decrease morbidity and mortality by specifically targeting the malignant cell. Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies have shown only moderate activity. A second, more effective, approach involves antibody conjugation with radioactive particles or chemotherapeutic agents, such as, immunotoxins, targeted delivery of cell killing. The antigens CD33, CD45, and CD66, are three antigens to which monoclonal antibodies have been directed. Most experience has been with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) which is an immunoconjugate of an anti-CD33 antibody chemically linked to a potent cytotoxic agent, calicheamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin appears to be particularly active in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, possibly related to the high expression of the CD33 antigen on the cell surface. Although gemtuzumab ozogamicin has activity as a single agent, the most promising result may be seen when this agent is combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Preliminary studies have suggested a high complete remission rate and randomized clinical trials are underway. A unique potential toxicity has been identified, namely venoocclusive disease or sinusoidal obstructive syndrome which may be problematic among patients who subsequently undergo HSCT. An additional strategy includes radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to intensify the conditioning regimen prior to HSCT.

These investigations have shown that AML is a heterogeneous disease of biologically different entities. Current therapeutic approaches to AML are based on chemotherapy, but the side effects of the drugs used and various complications, including infections and bleeding, are sometimes fatal. In addition, responses to therapy and long-term outcome differ depending on the subentity in question. Therefore, it is essential to develop new therapeutic strategies such as biology adapted treatment based on the individual molecular pathogenesis of AML. Natural compounds appear to be safer than the current chemotherapeutic drugs, and we have therefore sought new potential agents among various natural compounds with the ability to induce the apoptosis of myeloid leukemic cells. Recently, we found that a highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated via the hydrogen peroxide/myeloperoxidase [H(2)O(2)/MPO/halide] system by natural compounds induces apoptosis in MPO-positive leukemic cells. This result is of great interest in establishing novel therapeutic approaches to AML mediated through ROS-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells.","['Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Xian, Mingji', 'Sagawa, Morihiko', 'Ikeda, Yasuo']","['Kizaki M', 'Xian M', 'Sagawa M', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. makizaki@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoproteins/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', '*Drug Design', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2006/11/02 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920106778521541 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 Oct;7(5):323-9. doi: 10.2174/138920106778521541.,,,,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: (1) To discuss the clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of AML with NPM1 gene mutations, along with various detection methods, (2) To explore the mechanisms by which NPM1 gene mutations contribute to leukemogenesis. DATA SOURCES/EXTRACTION: Data were analyzed from 7 recently published papers. RESULTS: NPM1 gene mutations tend to occur more frequently in women, and also tend to be associated with a higher white blood cell count. There is no significant age difference. NPM1-mutated AML is preferentially associated with AML with monocytic differentiation (in particular FAB M5b), lack of CD34, normal cytogenetics, FLT3 gene mutations, and a trend toward favorable clinical outcome, especially in patients without FLT3 gene mutation. NPM1 gene mutations cause a frame shift in the C-terminus of exon 12, disrupting the NPM nucleolar-localization signal or generating a leucine-rich nuclear export motif, resulting in abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of NPM. Several methods are suitable for detecting NPM1 gene mutation, including molecular and immunohistochemical studies. These mutations may contribute to leukemogenesis, at least in part, through disruption of the p14(ARF) (alternative reading frame) MDM2-p53 pathway and centrosomal duplication. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of NPM1 gene mutations may allow dissection of the heterogeneous group of AML with normal karyotype into prognostically different subgroups. Exploring the mechanisms may lead to a better understanding of how mutant NPM protein becomes leukemogenic, thereby providing insights for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents.","['Chen, Weina', 'Rassidakis, Georgios Z', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Chen W', 'Rassidakis GZ', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 72, Houston, TX 77030, USA. weinachen@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/genetics', 'Molecular Biology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/11/02 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/02 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['RA-5-1111 [pii]', '10.5858/2006-130-1687-NGMIAM [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2006 Nov;130(11):1687-92. doi: 10.5858/2006-130-1687-NGMIAM.,,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this article is to review recent studies in patient populations at high risk for invasive fungal infections. RECENT FINDINGS: Itraconazole, lipid formulations of amphotericin B, posaconazole, caspofungin and micafungin have been utilized for prophylaxis in different immunocompromised host settings. Itraconazole and caspofungin remain an option especially in patients with hematological diseases. Low dose liposomal amphotericin B shows a lower morbidity rate in patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia. Posaconazole demonstrated survival benefits in this setting although data have only been presented at an international meeting. In the transplantation setting, micafungin was superior to fluconazole during the early neutropenic phase and posaconazole was superior to fluconazole in preventing invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic transplant recipients treated for graft-versus-host disease. Results from the latter study have thus far only been presented in abstract form. SUMMARY: Prophylaxis should only be given to a high-risk population. Results of studies should demonstrate morbidity and mortality advantages. The new generation of azoles and echinocandins have a favorable safety and drug interaction profile and appear advantageous in specific settings of immunosuppression. Pending full publication, posaconazole appears to be an appropriate agent for prophylaxis in acute myeloid leukemia patients or patients treated for graft-versus-host disease. Micafungin is superior to fluconazole in the neutropenic phase of hematopoietic transplantation.","['Ullmann, Andrew J', 'Cornely, Oliver A']","['Ullmann AJ', 'Cornely OA']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Klinikum der Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat, Mainz, Germany. ullmann@uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control']",2006/11/01 09:00,2007/02/08 09:00,['2006/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/QCO.0b013e3280108e45 [doi]', '00001432-200612000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2006 Dec;19(6):571-6. doi: 10.1097/QCO.0b013e3280108e45.,,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to treat amyloidosis, the type of abnormal protein must be identified. The most common type is monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain or AL amyloidosis. One-third to one-half of patients with systemic AL amyloidosis has renal involvement in the form of glomerular, vascular and interstitial deposits of amyloid causing progressive proteinuria. Less than 5% of AL patients present with renal failure requiring dialysis; patients with renal involvement usually present with fatigue, peripheral edema, proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. The aim of therapy in systemic AL amyloidosis is to reduce the amyloid-forming monoclonal light chains, measured with the serum free light chain assay, by suppressing the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia, while using supportive measures to sustain organ function. Amyloid deposits can be resorbed and organ function restored if the amyloid-forming precursor light chain is eliminated. The most effective treatment for systemic AL is risk-adapted melphalan with peripheral blood stem cell transplant; oral melphalan and dexamethasone is the most effective therapy for patients who are not stem cell transplant candidates although it carries a risk of myelodysplasia and leukemia. Novel therapies currently under study include thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide. With therapy, a majority of patients can achieve long-term durable remissions with stabilization or recovery of organ function. The use of novel antibody-based approaches for imaging amyloid and possibly for accelerating removal of deposits is under active investigation.","['Comenzo, Raymond L']",['Comenzo RL'],"['Cytotherapy Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. comenzor@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Contrib Nephrol,Contributions to nephrology,7513582,"['0 (Amyloid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Amyloid/metabolism', 'Amyloidosis/immunology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*physiology', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Kidney/immunology/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use']",2006/11/01 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['96768 [pii]', '10.1159/000096768 [doi]']",ppublish,Contrib Nephrol. 2007;153:195-210. doi: 10.1159/000096768.,,,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 10% of myeloma patients develop amyloidosis; primary amyloidosis may be thought of as the pathological analog of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The kidney is a common site of accumulation of amyloid fibrils and is also the target of other light chain pathologies. Understanding the structural origin of these pathologies is complicated by the extreme primary structure heterogeneity of light chains. METHODS: Patterns of light chain germline gene usage in myeloma patients were compared to those found in other immune system disorders: lymphoma, leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. RESULTS: Significant differences in apparent gene usage are found in the various diseases; several germline gene products have not been documented in myeloma patients to date. CONCLUSION: The plasma cell dyscrasias including myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are usually monoclonal diseases; however, the light chains produced are not homogeneous. Thus, the pathological risk for the patient may change during the course of the illness. Mutation rates in light chains observed during clonal diversification parallel mutations occurring in all genes in the malignant cells and could be a clinically useful biomarker.","['Gu, Minyi', 'Wilton, Rosemary', 'Stevens, Fred J']","['Gu M', 'Wilton R', 'Stevens FJ']","['Biosciences Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Contrib Nephrol,Contributions to nephrology,7513582,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amyloidosis/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Germ-Line Mutation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*immunology']",2006/11/01 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['96766 [pii]', '10.1159/000096766 [doi]']",ppublish,Contrib Nephrol. 2007;153:156-81. doi: 10.1159/000096766.,,,"['AG18001/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43957/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, eIF4E coordinately promotes the messenger RNA (mRNA) export of several genes involved in the cell cycle. A common feature of these mRNAs is a structurally conserved, approximately 50-nucleotide element in the 3' untranslated region denoted as an eIF4E sensitivity element. This element is sufficient for localization of capped mRNAs to eIF4E nuclear bodies, formation of eIF4E-specific ribonucleoproteins in the nucleus, and eIF4E-dependent mRNA export. The roles of eIF4E in translation and mRNA export are distinct, as they rely on different mRNA elements. Furthermore, eIF4E-dependent mRNA export is independent of ongoing RNA or protein synthesis. Unlike the NXF1-mediated export of bulk mRNAs, eIF4E-dependent mRNA export is CRM1 dependent. Finally, the growth-suppressive promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) inhibits this RNA regulon.

RESULTS: Of all patients, 35% refused or abandoned treatment, 23% experienced treatment-related death, 22% had progressive or relapsed leukemia, and 20% had an overall event-free survival. Treatment results differed significantly between patients with different socioeconomic status; 47% of poor and 2% of prosperous patients refused or abandoned treatment. Although poor and prosperous patients used the same protocol, the provided treatment differed. Poor patients received less individualized attention from oncologists and less structured parental education. Strong social hierarchical structures hindered communication with doctors, resulting in a lack of parental understanding of the necessity to continue treatment. Most poor patients could not afford treatment. Access to donated chemotherapy also was inadequate. Treatment refusal or abandonment frequently resulted. There was no follow-up system to detect and contact dropouts. Health care providers were not fully aware that their own attitude and communication skills were important for ensuring compliance of patients and parents. CONCLUSIONS: Children's survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in developing countries could improve if problems that are associated with parental financial and educational background and medical teams' attitudes to treatment and follow-up could be addressed better.","['Mostert, Saskia', 'Sitaresmi, Mei N', 'Gundy, Chad M', 'Sutaryo', 'Veerman, Anjo J P']","['Mostert S', 'Sitaresmi MN', 'Gundy CM', 'Sutaryo', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vrije University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.mostert@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2006/11/01 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['peds.2005-3015 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2005-3015 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2006 Dec;118(6):e1600-6. doi: 10.1542/peds.2005-3015.

METHODS: The expression of survivin mRNA was measured in 105 AL and 21 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients with semi-quantity reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. 15 adults were tested as normal control (NC) and K562, NB4, Kg-1alpha, HL-60 cell lines were also tested as positive control. The cell cycle distribution in AL was measured with flow cytometry (FCM) to analyze the relationship between the level of survivin and cell proliferation. RESULTS: The expression of survivin in de novo AL (0.525 +/- 0.460) was higher than that in NC (0.101 +/- 0.187), while it decreased in complete remission (CR) patients (0.280 +/- 0.095). In replased patients (0.935 +/- 0.343), the expression of survivin increased again. There was no difference of the expression between chronic phase of CML (0.279 +/- 0.112) and NC, but in acute phase of CML (0.653 +/- 0.236), the expression was higher than that in NC. The cases with higher level of survivin had significantly higher proliferation indices (mean PI 9.682) than those (mean PI 6.899). In AL patients, the CR rate of survivin positive cases was lower than that of survivin negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: The PI in survivin positive patients was significantly higher than that in survivin negative indicating its impact on proliferation and cleavage. Abnormal expression of survivin genes was related to pathogenesis and progression of AL and it can serve as a marker of relapse and poor prognosis in AL.

They all received standard conditioning regimens with Bu/Cy (n = 53) or TBI/Cy (n = 10) with the addition of ATG for 3 - 4 days (n = 58) or CD3 antibody (n = 5). There were more patients receiving rabbit ATG in the UPBSCT group than UBMT (21/33 vs 8/25, P = 0.02) and the remaining patients received pig ATG. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of cyclosporine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil were the same. RESULTS: The two groups were matched for the following factors: gender, diagnosis, HLA-compatibility and conditioning regimens. The median age in the UPBSCT group was 29.5 (10 - 47) years and in the UBMT 21.5 (7 - 42) years (P < 0.05). The UPBSCT group consisted of 10 females and 23 males and the UBMT group 7 females and 23 males. Eleven patients in the UPBSCT and 8 patients in the UBMT group were diagnosed with as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); 9 and 12 as acute myelocytic leukemia (AML); 11 and 10 as acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL); 2 and 0 as severe aplastic anemia (SAA). There were more patients in aggressive stage (>CR1) in the UBMT group than in the UPBSCT group (9/30 vs 3/33, P = 0.06). Median follow-up was 12 months after UPBSCT and 20 months after UBMT (P < 0.05). UPBSCT group had a higher number of infused MNC as comparison with UBMT group (6.16 x 10(8)/kg vs 2.80 x 10(8)/kg, P < 0.05). Both neutrophil and platelet recovery were faster after UPBSCT (11 days vs 17 days, 14 days vs 27.5 days, P < 0.01). Although the cumulative incidence of grades II - IV acute GVHD and severe aGVHD in the UPBSCT group were less than in the UBMT group (33.04% vs 66.69%, 7.26% vs 34.52%, P < 0.05), there was no difference after the source of ATG was counted. The incidence of chronic GVHD did not differ between the two groups (18/25 vs 14/22). Relapse including molecular relapse occurred in 6 of the 31 patients after UPBSCT and in 4 of the 30 patients after UBMT (P > 0.05). Finally, fifteen of the 30 patients died after UBMT, as compared with 8 of the 33 patients after UPBSCT. The cumulative overall survival was 62.45% after UPBSCT and 47.22% after UBMT (P = 0.114).

Paradoxically, however, the cholinergic population of septohippocampal neurones was more resistant to axotomy in these mutants. As leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been identified as a potential neuroprotective factor for the cholinergic medial septum (MS) neurones, FFT-induced responses were compared in CNTF(-/-), LIF(-/-) and CNTF/LIF double knockout mice. In CNTF(-/-) mice, FFT-induced cholinergic degeneration was confirmed to be attenuated as compared with wildtype mice. The expression of both LIF and LIF receptor beta was increased in the MS providing a possible explanation for the enhanced neuronal resistance to FFT in these animals. However, ablation of the LIF gene also produced paradoxical effects; following FFT in LIF(-/-) mice no loss of GABAergic or cholinergic MS neurones was detectable during the first postlesional week, suggesting that other efficient neuroprotective mechanisms are activated in these animals. In fact, enhanced activation of astrocytes, a source of neurotrophic proteins, was indicated by increased up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin expression. In addition, mRNA levels for neurotrophin signalling components (e.g. nerve growth factor, p75(NTR)) were differentially regulated. The positive effect on axotomized cholinergic neurones seen in CNTF(-/-) and LIF(-/-) mice as well as the increased up-regulation of astrogliose markers was abolished in CNTF/LIF double knockout animals.

Among these, voltage-gated sodium channels expressed in non-nervous or non-muscular organs are often associated with the metastatic behaviour of different cancers.

The cell populations of both normal and cancer tissues consist of resting stem cells, proliferating transit-amplifying cells, terminally differentiating cells and dying (apoptotic) cells. The difference between normal tissue renewal and growth of cancers is that some of the transit-amplifying cells in the cancer population do not mature into terminally differentiating cells, but instead continue to proliferate and do not die (maturation arrest). Because of this the number of cancer cells increase, whereas the cell population of normal tissues remains a relatively constant. Conventional radiation treatment and chemotherapy kill the actively proliferating transit- amplifying cells of the cancer. Differentiation therapy, using specific targeted inhibitors of activation, effectively induces differentiation of the proliferating transit-amplifying cancer cells. However, even if the proliferating cancer cells are completely inhibited or eliminated, the cancer stem cells may restore the transit-amplifying population, so that clinical remission is usually temporary. The hypothesis presented in this paper is that successful cancer therapy must be directed against both the resting stem cells and the proliferating cells of the cancer. This may be possible if specific stem cell signals are inhibited using gene therapy, while at the same time attacking proliferating cells by conventional radiation treatment or chemotherapy. With advances in approaches using specific inhibitory RNA, such combination therapy may now be possible, but critical problems in delivering the inhibitory effect specifically to the cancer stem cells have yet to be worked out.","['Sell, Stewart']",['Sell S'],"['Wadsworth Center and Ordway Research Institute, New York State Dept. of Health, Empire State Plaza, Albany, NY 12201, USA. ssell@wadsworth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/therapy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Female', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'Stem Cells', 'Teratocarcinoma/metabolism/therapy', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",2006/11/01 09:00,2006/12/12 09:00,['2006/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156652306778520674 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2006 Oct;6(5):579-91. doi: 10.2174/156652306778520674.,,,,,162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although of the order of 75-85% of patients will achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy, long-term survival is still relatively low. Despite the progress in the rational design of drugs in disorders such as chronic myeloid leukaemia, AML lacks a single specific pathogenomic event to act as a drug target. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is a member of a family of related proteins that act as transcriptional activators or repressors. IRF1 and its functional antagonist IRF2 originally discovered as transcription factors regulating the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene, are involved in the regulation of normal haematopoiesis and leukaemogenesis. IRF1 appears to act as a tumour suppressor gene and IRF2 as an oncogene. IRF1 acts to repress IRF2 function through the repression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21WAF1 critical for cell growth control.

Despite recent advances, chemotherapeutic treatments often remain unsatisfying due to severe side effects and incomplete long-term remission. Therefore the evaluation of novel therapeutic options is of great interest. B cell malignancies, in particularly follicular lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, represent the most immune-responsive types of all human cancer. Several immunotherapeutic strategies are presently employed to combat these B-cell malignancies. Active immunotherapies include vaccination strategies with dendritic cells (DCs) and genetically-modified tumor cell preparations as well as DNA and protein vaccination. Most of these vaccines target the tumor-specific immunoglobulin idiotype and have already demonstrated some anti-lymphoma activity in early phase clinical trials while their definitive impact is evaluated in ongoing phase III randomized trials. In contrast to these active immunizations, T cells transduced with chimeric antigen receptors and donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) represent adoptive (passive) immunotherapies. Recent advances of gene transduction technologies enabled improvement of immunotherapeutic strategies based on genetic modification of malignant cells or adoptive T cells. Current early phase clinical trials are investigating the potential of these innovative approaches. At the moment it remains unclear if the novel immunotherapeutic strategies will be able to play a similar role in the treatment of B cell malignancies than the already established antibody-based immunotherapy.","['Kofler, D M', 'Mayr, C', 'Wendtner, C-M']","['Kofler DM', 'Mayr C', 'Wendtner CM']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. david.kofler@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive/methods/*trends', 'Immunotherapy, Active/methods/*trends', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*therapy']",2006/11/01 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138945006778559120 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2006 Oct;7(10):1371-4. doi: 10.2174/138945006778559120.,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL is a remarkably diverse disorder following an extremely variable clinical course. Some patients have an indolent disease that may never require treatment. In others a progressive clinical course is rapidly fatal. CLL affects mainly elderly individuals, but about a third of patients are less than 60 years of age at diagnosis. Traditionally, the therapeutic procedures were aimed at palliation, but over the recent years highly effective and potentially curative approaches such as combined antibody-chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation have been developed. In parallel there has been progress in the understanding of pathogenesis and outcome prediction. The cornerstones to estimate prognosis are the clinical staging systems of Rai and Binet. To refine outcome prediction for individual patients there has been intensive work on biological factors of potential prognostic relevance. Among these, the genetic characteristics of the CLL cells that can be divided into genomic aberrations and the mutation status of the variable segments of immunoglobulin-heavy chain genes (VH) have attained considerable importance. In addition, data on gene expression of CLL cells are accumulating which further characterize the CLL subgroups. In this context, the expression of ZAP-70 has been recognized a useful surrogate marker to predict the VH mutation status and outcome of CLL patients. At present, targeted therapies are focused on humanized antibodies that bind proteins expressed on the surface of CLL cells. The most prominent agents of these are the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, which are currently being tested in clinical trials. To identify CLL-specific gene expression products as candidates for targeted therapies will be an important part of CLL research in the next years.","['Winkler, Dirk', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Winkler D', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/*therapy']",2006/11/01 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/11/01 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138945006778559184 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2006 Oct;7(10):1313-27. doi: 10.2174/138945006778559184.,,,,,170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein toxins from either plants or bacteria are extremely potent based on their enzymatic inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis. Plant toxins, particularly ricin, are useful for chemically conjugating to monoclonal antibodies, and have shown clinical activity in several types of lymphoma and leukemia. Their dose is generally limited by vascular leak syndrome. Bacterial toxins have been used to produce single chain fusions with either growth factors or recombinant antibody fragments. These agents are smaller in size (55-65 kDa) and exit the bloodstream much more rapidly than the chemical conjugates, and generally do not cause severe vascular leak syndrome. The only approved drug containing a protein toxin is denileukin diftitox, a fusion of human interleukin 2 with truncated diphtheria toxin. Denileukin diftitox has shown efficacy in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recombinant immunotoxin BL22 is an anti-CD22 Fv fragment fused to truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin; it induces complete remissions in a high percentage of patients with chemoresistant hairy cell leukemia.

The results after treatment with various TBI regimens were compared, and dose-effect relationships for the endpoints relapse incidence, disease-free survival, treatment-related mortality, and overall survival were derived. The aim was to define requirements for an optimal treatment schedule with respect to leukemic cell kill and late normal-tissue morbidity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was performed. Three randomized studies, four studies comparing results of two or three TBI regimens, and nine reports with results of one specific TBI regimen were identified. Biologically effective doses (BEDs) were calculated. The results of the randomized studies and the studies comparing results of two or three TBI regimens were pooled, and the pooled relative risk (RR) was calculated for the treatments with high BED values versus treatments with a low BED. BED-effect relationships were obtained. RESULTS: RRs for the high BED treatments were significantly lower for relapse incidence, not significantly different for disease- free survival and treatment-related mortality, and significantly higher for overall survival. BED-effect relationships indicate a decrease in relapse incidence and treatment-related mortality and an increase in disease-free and overall survival with higher BED values. CONCLUSION: ""More dose is better"", provided that a TBI setting is used limiting the BEDs of lungs, kidneys, and eye lenses.","['Kal, Henk B', 'Loes van Kempen-Harteveld, M', 'Heijenbrok-Kal, Majanka H', 'Struikmans, Henk']","['Kal HB', 'Loes van Kempen-Harteveld M', 'Heijenbrok-Kal MH', 'Struikmans H']","['Department of Radiotherapy Qoo118, University Medical Center, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.

However, its role in epithelial cancers has not been extensively investigated. Herein, we show a marked accumulation of AML1 transcripts including a high frequency of a novel alternatively spliced AML1b transcript lacking exon 6 (AML1b(Del179-242)) in ovarian cancer patients. The increases in RNA transcripts for total wild-type AML1 and AML1b(Del179-242) are associated with poor patient outcomes. We have shown that although both wild-type AML1b and AML1b(Del179-242) are localized to nuclear speckles, AML1b(Del179-242) was observed to have dramatically reduced transactivation potential with the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoters and behaved as a weak dominant negative of wild-type AML1b. Wild-type AML1b was found to inhibit the growth of immortalized ovarian epithelial cells (T29) decreasing colony-forming ability. Moreover, we have identified a novel function of AML1b where it inhibits ovarian cell migration. In contrast, AML1b(Del179-242) has lost the ability to inhibit both ovarian cell proliferation and migration indicating that the functional effects observed with wild-type AML1b are dependent on amino acids 179-242. Collectively, these studies suggest that deregulated alternative splicing of AML1b transcripts may potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of ovarian cancers.","['Nanjundan, M', 'Zhang, F', 'Schmandt, R', 'Smith-McCune, K', 'Mills, G B']","['Nanjundan M', 'Zhang F', 'Schmandt R', 'Smith-McCune K', 'Mills GB']","['Department of Molecular Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA. mnanjund@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/genetics/metabolism', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/genetics/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210067 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210067 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Apr 19;26(18):2574-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210067.

IL-6 has been considered a positive growth factor in late-stage prostate cancer cells and a potential target for therapeutic interference. Effects of inhibition of IL-6 on cell survival were studied in LNCaP-IL6+ cells, a model system for advanced prostate cancer, which produce IL-6. We show that the autocrine IL-6 loop is responsible for resistance to apoptosis and increased cellular levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Treatment of cells with a chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody (CNTO 328) led to the induction of apoptosis and downregulation of Mcl-1 protein levels. Specific knockdown of Mcl-1 gene expression by small interfering RNA also yielded an increase in apoptosis of LNCaP-IL-6+ cells. Vice versa, inactivation of IL-6 autocrine loop had no influence on apoptosis levels in the absence of Mcl-1, thus suggesting this molecule as a mediator of the survival action of IL-6. Mcl-1 protein regulation by the endogenous cytokine directly involved the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Our data support the concept of anti-IL-6 targeted therapy in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.","['Cavarretta, I T', 'Neuwirt, H', 'Untergasser, G', 'Moser, P L', 'Zaki, M H', 'Steiner, H', 'Rumpold, H', 'Fuchs, D', 'Hobisch, A', 'Nemeth, J A', 'Culig, Z']","['Cavarretta IT', 'Neuwirt H', 'Untergasser G', 'Moser PL', 'Zaki MH', 'Steiner H', 'Rumpold H', 'Fuchs D', 'Hobisch A', 'Nemeth JA', 'Culig Z']","['Department of Urology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'T4H8FMA7IM (siltuximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Disease Progression', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210097 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210097 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 May 3;26(20):2822-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210097.

It is characterized by systemic and oral cavity alterations. Depending on the timing of lesions, GVHD is classified as acute or chronic. Alterations in the oral cavity are lichenoid reticular lesions, erythema, ulcerations, and xerostomia. Sporadically, mucocele and pyogenic granulomas can be present. AIM: To describe GVHD oral manifestations in eight allogenic BMT patients, and discuss GVHD and drug-immunosuppresion associated lesions diagnosis and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: For a year, we examined the oral mucosa of eight consecutive allogenic BMT patients attending the Dermatology out-patient clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (National Institute of Oncology) in Mexico City, looking for oral mucosa lesions. RESULTS: Patients were five men and three women, ages 24.8 -/+ 9.7 years. Four had a BMT because of chronic granulocytic, two for acute myeloblastic, one for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one for aplastic anemia. Three patients developed acute GVHD, with reticular oral mucosa lesions, erythema and mucositis; and all eight developed chronic GVHD, with reticular oral lesions, erythema, and ulcerations. A Patient had tongue and cheek pyogenic granulomas. Six reported xerostomia. Other oral lesions, associated to drug-immunosuppression, were candidiasis and herpes simplex. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GVHD frequently develop oral lesions, some of which interfere with normal feeding; timely diagnosis and treatment are therefore essential to improve the quality of life of affected patients. We propose an alternative treatment for pyogenic granulomas.","['de la Rosa Garcia, Estela', 'Bologna Molina, Ronell', 'Vega Gonzalez, Teresa de Jesus']","['de la Rosa Garcia E', 'Bologna Molina R', 'Vega Gonzalez Tde J']","['Health Care Department, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Xochimilco, Mexico. delarosa0712@msn.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",101231694,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mouth Diseases/*etiology']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10489411 [pii]'],epublish,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal. 2006 Nov 1;11(6):E486-92.,20061101,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leptin also plays a role in hematopoiesis, cell cycle regulation, and in oncogenesis. The leptin receptor is a single transmembrane protein belonging to the superfamily of cytokine receptors, structurally related to the hemopoietin receptor family. The aim of the study was to evaluate bone marrow and peripheral blood leptin level and frequency of distribution of leptin receptor gene polymorphism Gln223Arg in children with acute leukemia. The examined group included 92 children with acute leukemia (83 ALL and 9 AML) and 39 non-leukemic control children. Leptin level was measured by ELISA method at the day of leukemia diagnosis. Genomic DNA was isolated with the use of a column method and the genotyping of DNA sequence variation was carried out by the restriction enzyme analysis of PCR - amplified DNA. The samples were then electrophoresed on 2.5% agarose gel. Leptin level in leukemic children was lower than in healthy children. Bone marrow leptin level was significantly lower than that in the blood in leukemic children with ALL-T and AML. An analysis of frequency distribution of the Gln233Arg polymorphism in the leptin receptor gene in leukemic children showed lack of differences between the patients and controls. There was no difference in the genotype frequencies between the leukemic AML and ALL groups either. The results indicate a possible relation between the leptin level and leukemia development in children. The effectory effect of the hormone seems not related to Gln223Arg polymorphism of its receptor.","['Wasik, M', 'Gorska, E', 'Popko, K', 'Pawelec, K', 'Matysiak, M', 'Demkow, U']","['Wasik M', 'Gorska E', 'Popko K', 'Pawelec K', 'Matysiak M', 'Demkow U']","['Department of Laboratory Diagnostics and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland. wasik@litewska.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,J Physiol Pharmacol,Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,9114501,"['0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leptin/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin/*genetics']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/12/20 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Physiol Pharmacol. 2006 Sep;57 Suppl 4:375-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HOX proteins interact with the non-HOX homeobox protein PBX1 to regulate, both positively and negatively, the expression of target genes. In this study, we synthesized a decoy peptide containing the YPWM motif from HOX proteins (decoy HOX [decHOX]), which was predicted to act as a HOX mimetic, and analyzed its effects on self-renewal of human cord blood CD34(+) cells. We were able to deliver decHOX into approximately 70% of CD34(+) cells. By examining the expression of HOX target genes c-myc and p21(waf1/cip1), we confirmed that decHOX enhanced HOX functions. After 7 days of culture in serum-free medium containing a cytokine cocktail, cultures treated with decHOX had approximately twofold-increased numbers of CD34(+) cells and primitive multipotent progenitor cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, decHOX-treated cells reconstituted hematopoiesis in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice more rapidly and more effectively (more than twofold greater efficiency, as determined by a limiting dilution method) than control cells. decHOX-treated cells were also able to repopulate secondary recipients.

AML cells that failed to generate leukemic DCs showed significantly higher cellular VEGF levels compared with generated leukemic DCs, and down-regulation of cellular VEGF levels induced the generation of leukemic DCs from AML cells. Inhibition of cellular VEGF levels increased interleukin (IL)-12 production and the allostimulatory capacity of leukemic DCs.

Because the chemokine receptors play crucial roles in tissue-specific homing of mature lymphocytes, particular chemokine receptors expressed on ATLL cells may be involved in their tissue infiltration. We thus performed a comprehensive survey on the chemokine receptor expression in ATLL. ATLL cells expressed transcripts of CCR1, CCR4, CCR7, CCR8, CCR10 and CXCR4 but hardly expressed those of CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, CCR6, CCR9, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR5. These results were confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometric analysis. Notably, patients who have skin lesions showed significantly higher levels of CCR10 mRNA expression than patients without skin lesions. ATLL cells migrated efficiently to the CCR4 ligand, CCL22, and moderately to the CCR10 ligands, CCL27 and CCL28. Moreover, ATLL skin lesions consistently contained transcripts of CCR10 and its ligands CCL27 and CCL28 besides those of CCR4 and its ligands CCL17 and CCL22 that have been reported previously. Collectively, the frequent co-expression of CCR4 and CCR10, the known pair of skin-homing chemokine receptors, may play an important role in ATLL invasion into the skin.","['Harasawa, Hitomi', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Hieshima, Kunio', 'Jin, Zhe', 'Nakayama, Takashi', 'Yoshie, Osamu', 'Shimizu, Kazuhiro', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Hayashi, Tomayoshi', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Ikeda, Shuichi', 'Soda, Hiroshi', 'Soda, Hisashi', 'Atogami, Sunao', 'Takasaki, Yumi', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Murata, Ken', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Harasawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Hieshima K', 'Jin Z', 'Nakayama T', 'Yoshie O', 'Shimizu K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Hayashi T', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Ikeda S', 'Soda H', 'Soda H', 'Atogami S', 'Takasaki Y', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Murata K', 'Sugahara K', 'Tsuruda K', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CCR10 protein, human)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, CCR10)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Chemokines/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CCR10', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/*metabolism']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/01/18 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['ML861861G4044TMX [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600775599 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Oct;47(10):2163-73. doi: 10.1080/10428190600775599.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, morphological examination contributed to diagnosis in only 20% cases, all of them CD5 negative. Thirty additional cases were CD5 negative suggestive of leukemic marginal zone lymphoma in most cases. The significantly poorer survival of the 26 cyclin D1 positive cases justifies recommending its systematic determination among atypical B-CLPD. CD20 expression segregated clearly two subgroups among CD5 positive cyclin D1 negative B-CLPD.

This study presents an overview of possible targets and genetherapeutical maneuvers for future immunotherapies of B-CLL patients and summarizes recent clinical vaccination trials with dendritic cells (DCs) for B-CLL.","['Giannopoulos, Krzysztof', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Giannopoulos K', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/metabolism', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/01/18 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['U043KT4N1T2081T2 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600709721 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Oct;47(10):2028-36. doi: 10.1080/10428190600709721.,,,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cancer stem cell (CSC) model accounts for this heterogeneity by proposing that each cancer consists of a small population of CSCs that are capable of unlimited growth and self-renewal and a much larger population of cells, descendants of the CSCs, that have lost self-renewal capacity. The CSC model has important implications for cancer therapy. Eradication of CSCs, the cells responsible for maintenance of the neoplasm, would be necessary and sufficient to achieve cure. By extension, both the frequency of stem cells in a tumor and their propensity to undergo self-renewal (Psr) would have a direct impact on the curability of that tumor. The Psr is a critical biological characteristic of CSCs-small differences in Psr have enormous impact on the probability of success in cancer therapy. Differentiation therapy, defined as treatment that reduces the Psr of CSCs, is one approach to targeting CSCs.","['Ichim, Christine V', 'Wells, Richard A']","['Ichim CV', 'Wells RA']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/01/18 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['R733387376XR4452 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600733325 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Oct;47(10):2017-27. doi: 10.1080/10428190600733325.,,,,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax localizes in unique nuclear bodies that contain components of the transcription and splicing complexes. In this work, we studied the relative intracellular localizations of Tax, Rex and p30(II). Run-on transcription assays and immunocytochemistry at light and electron microscopy levels indicated that the Tax nuclear bodies included both de novo transcribed RNA and the RNA polymerase II form that is phosphorylated on its carboxy-terminal domain whereas contacts with chromatin were observed at the periphery of these nuclear bodies. Rex first accumulated in nucleolar foci and then spread across the whole nucleus to display a diffuse and punctuate nucleoplasmic distribution. This distribution of Rex was observed in HTLV-1 transformed lymphocytes and in COS cells expressing the HTLV-1 provirus. Rex colocalized with the cellular export factor CRM-1 in the nucleolar foci as well as in the nucleoplasmic foci that did not overlap with Tax nuclear bodies but were found at the boundaries of the Tax bodies. In addition, we demonstrate that p30(II) interacts with Rex and colocalizes with the Rex/CRM-1 complexes in the nucleoli leading to their clearance from the nucleoplasm. Our results suggest that transcripts originating from Tax-induced activation of gene expression at the boundaries of the Tax bodies are transported out of the nucleus by nucleoplasmic Rex/CRM-1 complexes that are first assembled in nucleolar foci. In addition, p30(II) might exert its negative effect on viral RNA transport by preventing the release of the Rex/CRM-1 complexes from sequestration in nucleolar foci. These data support the idea that the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of HTLV-1 gene expression depends on the concentration of select regulatory complexes at specific area of the nucleus.","['Baydoun, Hicham', 'Duc-Dodon, Madeleine', 'Lebrun, Sylvie', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Bex, Francoise']","['Baydoun H', 'Duc-Dodon M', 'Lebrun S', 'Gazzolo L', 'Bex F']","['Institute for Microbiological Research J-M Wiame and Laboratory of Microbiology, University of Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (tof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism/virology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', 'Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Polymerase II/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/03/08 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(06)00593-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2006.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2007 Jan 15;386(1-2):191-201. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2006.09.008.

Sodium arsenite is known to suppress both the IKK-NF-kappaB and JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathways and to activate the MAPK/JNK-cJun pathways, thereby committing some cancers to undergo apoptosis. Indeed, sodium arsenite is an effective drug for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with little nonspecific toxicity. Malignant melanoma is highly refractory to conventional radio- and chemotherapy. In the present study, we observed strong effects of sodium arsenite treatment on upregulation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human and mouse melanomas. Arsenite treatment upregulated surface levels of death receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, through increased translocation of these proteins from cytoplasm to the cell surface. Furthermore, activation of cJun and suppression of NF-kappaB by sodium arsenite resulted in upregulation of the endogenous TRAIL and downregulation of the cFLIP gene expression (which encodes one of the main anti-apoptotic proteins in melanomas) followed by cFLIP protein degradation and, finally, by acceleration of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Direct suppression of cFLIP expression by cFLIP RNAi also accelerated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in these melanomas, while COX-2 suppression substantially increased levels of both TRAIL-induced and arsenite-induced apoptosis.

Caspase-3 activity assay revealed that both isoxazolidinones (4) were able to induce apoptosis process in time- and concentration-dependent manner. Using multiplex PCR analysis, it was observed that 4 caused distinct inhibition of BCL-2 gene expression. Expression of BAX, a pro-apoptotic gene remained unchanged. It was also found that 4a,b did not induce the expression of MDR1 and MRP1 genes, related to multidrug resistance. In addition, cytotoxicity data obtained for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant HL-60 ADR cells revealed that the investigated compounds were poor substrates for transport by MRP1 efflux pump, suggesting that they might be useful for treating drug-resistant tumors.

Two sets of 31 homopyrimidine oligonucleotides each, corresponding to co-localising sequences in the abl region of chromosome 9 and in the bcr region of chromosome 22 were synthesised. Probe types and sizes (in bases) as well as the binding mechanisms of both FISH techniques were completely different. In accordance to established findings that cell type specific radial positioning of chromosomes and sub-chromosomal elements is evolutionarily conserved, no significant difference was found between the two FISH techniques for the radial localisation of the barycentre of the analysed genomic loci. Thermal denaturation and hypotonic treatment of cell nuclei subjected to standard FISH, however, led to different absolute radii and volumes of the cell nuclei, in comparison to the quantities determined for the triple helical COMBO-FISH technique; the chromatin appears to shrink in laterally enlarged, flat nuclei. Consequently, the absolute distances of the homologous labelled sites shifted to greater values. For precise quantitative microscopic analysis of genomic loci, fluorescence labelling procedures are recommended that well maintain the native chromatin topology. Triple helical COMBO-FISH may offer such an approach.","['Schwarz-Finsterle, Jutta', 'Stein, Stefan', 'Grossmann, Constance', 'Schmitt, Eberhard', 'Trakhtenbrot, Luba', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Cremer, Christoph', 'Hausmann, Michael']","['Schwarz-Finsterle J', 'Stein S', 'Grossmann C', 'Schmitt E', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Rechavi G', 'Amariglio N', 'Cremer C', 'Hausmann M']","['Kirchhoff-Institute of Physics, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 227, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Biochem Biophys Methods,Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods,7907378,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'DNA Probes/genetics', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/*genetics']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/05/17 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2005/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-022X(06)00167-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbbm.2006.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem Biophys Methods. 2007 Apr 10;70(3):397-406. doi: 10.1016/j.jbbm.2006.09.004.

Accumulating genetic and functional evidence points to ETV6 as being the most probable TSG targeted by the deletions. ETV6 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor of the ETS family with very few known targets. To understand its function and to elucidate the impact of its absence in leukaemia, we conducted a study to identify targeted genes. Following the induction of ETV6 expression, global expression was evaluated at different time points. We identified 87 modulated genes, of which 10 (AKR1C1, AKR1C3, IL18, LUM, PHLDA1, PTGER4, PTGS2, SPHK1, TP53 and VEGF) were validated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. To assess the significance of the validated candidate genes in leukaemia, their expression patterns were determined, as well as that of ETV6, in pre-B ALL patients. The expression of IL18, LUM, PTGER4, SPHK1 and TP53 was significantly correlated with that of ETV6, further suggesting that ETV6 could regulate the expression of these genes in leukaemia. This work constitutes another step towards the understanding of the functions of ETV6 and the impact of its inactivation in childhood leukaemia.","['Boily, Gino', 'Larose, Josiane', 'Langlois, Sylvie', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Boily G', 'Larose J', 'Langlois S', 'Sinnett D']","['Division of Hematology-oncology, Research Centre, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting/methods', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection/methods']",2006/10/31 09:00,2007/03/29 09:00,['2006/10/31 09:00'],"['2006/10/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6377 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06377.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Jan;136(1):48-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06377.x.

Response rates, even with highly aggressive therapy such as stem cell transplantation, are limited, ranging from 4 to 43%, and the medium survival time ranges from 5 to 8 months. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old patient with a history of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) was admitted with thoracic back pain and assumed progression of the CLL. The patient showed no fever, night sweats or weight loss. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the progression of axillary and cervical lymph nodes. In addition, an intraspinal infiltration at the 8th thoracic vertebra (Th8) was detected. Surprisingly, histology of an extirpated lymph node demonstrated the existence of 2 tumors in the same lymph node. Infiltrates of small lymphocytes representing the pre-existing CLL (CD5-, CD20-, CD23-positive) coexisted with Reed-Sternberg Hodgkin's cells (CD30-, CD15-positive). Chemotherapy was started, combined with palliative radiation of vertebrae Th7-Th10. 12 months after diagnosis of Richter's transformation the patient is still alive without any progression of the underlying disease. CONCLUSION: We present a unique case of a Hodgkin's disease variant of Richter's transformation and CLL in the same lymph node, which was detected early because of spinal infiltration and was subsequently stabilized with reduced-dosage gemcitabine and local radiation. Additionally, we show unique pictures of 2 tumors coexisting in the same lymph node.","['Hueber, Axel J', 'Kallert, Stefan', 'Aigner, Thomas', 'Rosler, Wolf', 'Kalden, Jochen R', 'Schulze-Koops, Hendrik', 'Rech, Jurgen']","['Hueber AJ', 'Kallert S', 'Aigner T', 'Rosler W', 'Kalden JR', 'Schulze-Koops H', 'Rech J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/10/28 09:00,2006/12/14 09:00,['2006/10/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['96054 [pii]', '10.1159/000096054 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2006 Nov;29(11):526-8. doi: 10.1159/000096054.

Using a NOD/SCID mouse xenograft model, we report that immunostimulatory DNA oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODNs) stimulate significant immune activity against primary human ALL cells in vivo. The administration of CpG ODNs induced a significant reduction in systemic leukemia burden, mediated continued disease control, and significantly improved survival of mice with established human ALL. The death of leukemia cells in vivo was independent of the ability of ALL cells to respond directly to CpG ODNs and correlated with the production of IL-12p70, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma by the host. In addition, depletion of natural killer cells by anti-asialo-GM1 treatment significantly reduced the in vivo antileukemic activity of CpG ODN. This antileukemia effect was not limited to the xenograft model because natural killer cell-dependent killing of ALL by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was also increased by CpG ODN stimulation.

Our results demonstrate that CD4+CD56+HN and c-AML show distinct gene-expression profiles and distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations. CD4+CD56+HN is characterized by recurrent deletion of regions on chromosome 4 (4q34), chromosome 9 (9p13-p11 and 9q12-q34), and chromosome 13 (13q12-q31) that contain several tumor suppressor genes with diminished expression (Rb1, LATS2).

The BCR-ABL inhibitor, nilotinib (AMN107), is significantly more potent against BCR-ABL than imatinib, and is active against many imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. Phase 1/2 clinical trials show that nilotinib can induce remissions in patients who have previously failed imatinib, indicating that sequential therapy with these 2 agents has clinical value. However, simultaneous, rather than sequential, administration of 2 BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors is attractive for many reasons, including the theoretical possibility that this could reduce emergence of drug-resistant clones. Here, we show that exposure of a variety of BCR-ABL+ cell lines to imatinib and nilotinib results in additive or synergistic cytotoxicity, including testing of a large panel of cells expressing BCR-ABL point mutations causing resistance to imatinib in patients. Further, using a highly quantifiable bioluminescent in vivo model, drug combinations were at least additive in antileukemic activity, compared with each drug alone. These results suggest that despite binding to the same site in the same target kinase, the combination of imatinib and nilotinib is highly efficacious in these models, indicating that clinical testing of combinations of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors is warranted.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Catley, Laurie', 'Wright, Renee D', 'Moreno, Daisy', 'Banerji, Lolita', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Mestan, Juergen', 'Fabbro, Doriano', 'Jiang, Jingrui', 'Hall-Meyers, Elizabeth', 'Callahan, Linda', 'DellaGatta, Jamie L', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Catley L', 'Wright RD', 'Moreno D', 'Banerji L', 'Ray A', 'Manley PW', 'Mestan J', 'Fabbro D', 'Jiang J', 'Hall-Meyers E', 'Callahan L', 'DellaGatta JL', 'Kung AL', 'Griffin JD']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/10/28 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41938-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-026377 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):2112-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-026377.

Because gene activation could be associated with gene dysregulation, we attempted to screen for activating gene mutation based on high-level gene expression. We focused our study on the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in 90 cases of acute leukemia. This strategy led to the identification of a novel JAK2-acquired mutation in a patient with Down syndrome (DS) with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). This mutation involves a 5-amino acid deletion within the JH2 pseudokinase domain (JAK2DeltaIREED). Expression of JAK2DeltaIREED in Ba/F3 cells induced constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and growth factor-independent cell proliferation. These results highlight the JAK2 pseudokinase domain as an oncogenic hot spot and indicate that activation of the JAK-STAT pathway may contribute to lymphoid malignancies and hematologic disorders observed in children with DS.","['Malinge, Sebastien', 'Ben-Abdelali, Raouf', 'Settegrana, Catherine', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Debre, Marianne', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth A', 'Villeval, Jean-Luc', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Berger, Roland', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Penard-Lacronique, Virginie']","['Malinge S', 'Ben-Abdelali R', 'Settegrana C', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Debre M', 'Beldjord K', 'Macintyre EA', 'Villeval JL', 'Vainchenker W', 'Berger R', 'Bernard OA', 'Delabesse E', 'Penard-Lacronique V']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Scientifique (INSERM), E0210, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Sequence Alignment']",2006/10/28 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41949-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-09-045963 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):2202-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-09-045963.

Recent data suggest that the caudal homeobox transcription factors CDX1, CDX2, and CDX4, developmental regulators of HOX gene expression, may contribute to HOX gene dysregulation in leukemia. We report here that CDX4 is expressed normally in early hematopoietic progenitors and is expressed aberrantly in approximately 25% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. Cdx4 regulates Hox gene expression in the adult murine hematopoietic system and dysregulates Hox genes that are implicated in leukemogenesis. Furthermore, bone marrow progenitors that are retrovirally engineered to express Cdx4 serially replate in methylcellulose cultures, grow in liquid culture, and generate a partially penetrant, long-latency AML in bone marrow transplant recipients. Coexpression of the Hox cofactor Meis1a accelerates the Cdx4 AML phenotype and renders it fully penetrant. Structure-function analysis demonstrates that leukemic transformation requires intact Cdx4 transactivation and DNA-binding domains but not the putative Pbx cofactor interaction motif. Together, these data indicate that Cdx4 regulates Hox gene expression in adult hematopoiesis and may serve as an upstream regulator of Hox gene expression in the induction of acute leukemia. Inasmuch as many human leukemias show dysregulated expression of a spectrum of HOX family members, these collective findings also suggest a central role for CDX4 expression in the genesis of acute leukemia.","['Bansal, Dimple', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'McDowell, Elizabeth', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Davidson, Alan J', 'Daley, George Q', 'Zon, Leonard I', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Huntly, Brian J P']","['Bansal D', 'Scholl C', 'Frohling S', 'McDowell E', 'Lee BH', 'Dohner K', 'Ernst P', 'Davidson AJ', 'Daley GQ', 'Zon LI', 'Gilliland DG', 'Huntly BJ']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cdx4 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2006/10/28 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/10/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['0604579103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0604579103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Nov 7;103(45):16924-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0604579103.

Thirty-nine patients receiving nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) were compared with 97 patients receiving myeloablative transplantation. Patients receiving NST were at high risk for treatment-related complications given that they were older, 57 vs 43 years (P < .001), and more likely had received previous or myeloablative transplantation (54% vs 2%; P < .0001). The cumulative risk of relapse was higher for patients after NST (61% vs 38%; P = .02). The 100-day mortality was less after NST (15% vs 32%) Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 28% for NST and 34% for myeloablative transplantation (P = .89). Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years was 20% for NST and 31% for myeloablative transplantation (P = .31). Cox regression analysis showed that the intensity of the conditioning regimen had no effect on either OS or PFS. Despite the high-risk features of patients with advanced AML or MDS undergoing NST, OS and PFS in these patients was similar to those in patients receiving myeloablative transplantation. These results demonstrate that dose intensity plays a significant role in control of disease after transplantation, but that this benefit is negated by increasing treatment-related mortality. These results suggest that NST is a reasonable alternative for patients with advanced AML and MDS at high risk for complications after myeloablative transplantation.","['Alyea, Edwin P', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Ho, Vincent', 'Cutler, Corey', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J']","['Alyea EP', 'Kim HT', 'Ho V', 'Cutler C', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone R', 'Ritz J', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

The disassembly of actin filaments by C(2) toxin induces a polarization of cultured human leukaemia cell lines. RESULTS: The polarization induced by C(2) toxin was temperature dependent and was prevented by nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent, whereas it was promoted by paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing agent. The fluorescence staining of polarized cells indicated an increase in microtubule assembly accompanying disassembly of actin filaments. Furthermore, several actin-filament-disrupting agents, other than C(2) toxin, also induced microtubule assembly and cell polarization, irrespective of their different mechanisms of action. The effects induced by some of the agents, which have lower binding affinities for actin, were reversible in response to the re-assembly of actin filaments. CONCLUSIONS: Thus the disassembly of actin filaments by C(2) toxin and actin-filament-disrupting agents induces assembly of microtubules followed by polarization of human leukaemia cell lines, indicating that the assembly/disassembly equilibrium of actin filaments influences the dynamics of microtubules, which control cell morphology and, in turn, diverse cellular processes.","['Uematsu, Yosuke', 'Kogo, Yasusi', 'Ohishi, Iwao']","['Uematsu Y', 'Kogo Y', 'Ohishi I']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University, Kyonan 1-7-1, Musashino, Tokyo 180-8602, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'EC 3.4.24.69 (Botulinum Toxins)', 'FPM7829VMX (botulinum toxin type C)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Actins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Botulinum Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Polarity/drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology']",2006/10/28 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2006/10/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['BC20060089 [pii]', '10.1042/BC20060089 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 2007 Mar;99(3):141-50. doi: 10.1042/BC20060089.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells, called CEM(ZLA), are fully sensitive to ABV. The cellular resistance of the CEM(ZLA) cells to ZDV correlates with significant reductions in thymidine kinase (TK) activity and in the amount of intracellular TK protein. Interestingly, the reduction in TK activity led to impairment of the ability of CEM(ZLA) to accumulate the triphosphate metabolite of ZDV. However, the moderately 3TC-resistant phenotype of CEM(ZLA) cannot be ascribed to a similar reduction in deoxycytidine kinase activity. Compared to the parental CEM cells, CEM(ZLA) cells express a high level of multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), which could reduce the intracellular concentration of 3TC. This study shows that the exposure of cells to a combination of NAs is capable of simultaneously affecting more than one target site to confer resistance and that NAs display differing abilities to select cellular resistance mechanisms.","['Turriziani, Ombretta', 'Pagnotti, Paolo', 'Pierangeli, Alessandra', 'Focher, Federico', 'Baranello, Cinzia', 'Bellomi, Francesca', 'Falasca, Francesca', 'Morgan, Jessica', 'Schuetz, John D', 'Antonelli, Guido']","['Turriziani O', 'Pagnotti P', 'Pierangeli A', 'Focher F', 'Baranello C', 'Bellomi F', 'Falasca F', 'Morgan J', 'Schuetz JD', 'Antonelli G']","['Department of Experimental Medicine-Virology Section, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. ombretta.turriziani@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'WR2TIP26VS (abacavir)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dideoxynucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",2006/10/28 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.2006.22.960 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2006 Oct;22(10):960-7. doi: 10.1089/aid.2006.22.960.,,,"['GM60904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two percent of the patients were asymptomatic, 44% had HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and 23% had adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Phylogenetic analysis performed using part of the LTR region of the viral genome revealed that all Brazilian isolates belonged to the Cosmopolitan subtype, with the following distribution within the Transcontinental subgroup: 81.6% within the Latin American cluster and 15.8% outside the Latin American cluster. Two isolates belonged to the Japanese subgroup. Molecular analysis of the tax region showed a high nucleotide similarity ( approximately 99%) with 41 prototype sequences, including the ATK-1 isolate. The mean number of nucleotide substitutions ranged from 1 to 8. Five specific nucleotide substitutions, C7401T, T7914C, C7920T, C7982T, and G8231A, were highly conserved among the Brazilian isolates (79.6%), with a frequency ranging from 81.6% to 100% in the sample group and from 18.4% to 24.1% in the prototypes used, suggesting the existence of a molecular signature.

In this latter, it is of fundamental importance that the protein binding of the drug should be high (>80%), whereas the volume of its distribution should be relatively low (<0,2 l/kg body weight) and the endogenous clearance of it should be less, than 500 ml/min. Urgent leukocytapheresis should be performed above 50.000 blasts/microl, in acute or chronic myeloid leukemia if symptoms of leukostasis are present (if blasts are above 100.000/microl, cytoreduction is mandatory even without symptoms). Similarly, urgent thrombocytapheresis should be administered above platelet numbers 1000 G/l, when there is concomitant thrombophilia or clinical symptoms of thrombostasis are present.","['Belak, Mihaly', 'Jako, Janos']","['Belak M', 'Jako J']","['Orszagos Gyogyintezeti Kozpont, Belgyogyaszati es Geriatriai Klinika.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,,IM,"['Cytapheresis/*standards', 'Emergency Treatment/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Plasma Exchange/*standards', 'Plateletpheresis']",2006/10/28 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2006 Sep 24;147(38):1843-8.,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,A surgossegi plazmacsere es cytapheresis kezelesek indikacioja--irodalmi es tapasztalati osszefoglalo.,,,,

The PPTP has established panels of childhood cancer xenografts and cell lines to be used for in vivo and in vitro testing. These include panels for Wilms tumor, sarcomas (rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma), neuroblastoma, brain tumors (glioblastoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma), rhabdoid tumors (CNS and renal), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here, we describe the characteristics of the in vivo tumor panels and report results for the in vivo evaluation of two standard agents, vincristine and cyclophosphamide. PROCEDURES: Solid tumors were grown subcutaneously in immune-deficient mice and tumor dimensions were measured weekly. ALL xenografts were inoculated intravenously and human CD45-positive cells were enumerated weekly. RESULTS: Vincristine-induced objective responses in 6 of 24 (25%) and cyclophosphamide-induced objective responses in 18 of 28 (64%) solid tumor models. Comparable assessments of high levels of activity for these two agents were obtained using a tumor growth delay (TGD) measure. Both agents induced regressions in each of the ALL models evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: We have established 51 solid tumor and 10 ALL in vivo models. The models identify vincristine and cyclophosphamide as having broad-spectrum activity. The PPTP tumor panels appear to generally recapitulate the activity of these agents against specific childhood cancers and to have the potential for identifying novel agents having significant clinical activity.","['Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Tucker, Chandra', 'Payne, Debbie', 'Favours, Edward', 'Cole, Claire', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Zhang, Wendong', 'Lock, Richard', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Tajbakhsh, Mimi', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Maris, John M', 'Courtright, Joshua', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Friedman, Henry S', 'Stopford, Charles', 'Zeidner, Joseph', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Liu, Tiebin', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Khan, Javed', 'Ansher, Sherry', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Tucker C', 'Payne D', 'Favours E', 'Cole C', 'Gorlick R', 'Kolb EA', 'Zhang W', 'Lock R', 'Carol H', 'Tajbakhsh M', 'Reynolds CP', 'Maris JM', 'Courtright J', 'Keir ST', 'Friedman HS', 'Stopford C', 'Zeidner J', 'Wu J', 'Liu T', 'Billups CA', 'Khan J', 'Ansher S', 'Zhang J', 'Smith MA']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. peter.houghton@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21078 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Dec;49(7):928-40. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21078.,,,['N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of the present study was to examine demographic correlates of body mass index (BMI) changes over time from diagnosis through chemotherapy for children with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 307 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL who were treated at four South Texas pediatric oncology centers between 1990 and 2002. To minimize treatment-related variability, we excluded patients who received cranial irradiation as part of their treatment. Variation in age- and gender-standardized BMI z-scores according to age at diagnosis, gender, and ethnicity were assessed. RESULTS: The overall study cohort exhibited an increase in age- and gender-adjusted BMI z-scores for the first 24 months of chemotherapy followed by a slight decrease in BMI at 30 months (end of therapy). A repeated measures analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in the time-related pattern of BMI changes for age at diagnosis (P = 0.001) but no significant effect for gender (P = 0.32) or Hispanic versus non-Hispanic ethnicity (P = 0.89). DISCUSSION: In our cohort of ALL patients, BMI was elevated at diagnosis (mean standardized BMI z-score = 0.22, standard deviation = 1.4) then increased and remained elevated for the entire duration of chemotherapy. Children who were 2-9 years of age at diagnosis began therapy with a substantially lower BMI and remained lower over the course of chemotherapy than patients aged 10-18 years at diagnosis. It will be important for future investigations to explore the biological and behavioral factors that may underlie such differential patterns of BMI change over time.","['Baillargeon, Jacques', 'Langevin, Anne-Marie', 'Lewis, Margaret', 'Estrada, Jaime', 'Grady, James J', 'Mullins, Judith', 'Pitney, Aaron', 'Pollock, Brad H']","['Baillargeon J', 'Langevin AM', 'Lewis M', 'Estrada J', 'Grady JJ', 'Mullins J', 'Pitney A', 'Pollock BH']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSCSA), San Antonio, Texas 78229-3900, USA. baillargeon@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', '*Body Mass Index', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy/ethnology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21063 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Nov;49(6):793-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21063.,,,['CA11078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune escape mechanisms also contribute to the failure of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Infant leukemias with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangement have a remarkably short latency, and GVL effect after allo-SCT has not been clearly evidenced in these leukemias. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)- and FasL-mediated cytotoxic pathways play important roles in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- and natural killer cell-mediated antitumor immunity and optimal GVL activity. We investigated the in vitro sensitivity of MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cells to TRAIL- and FasL-mediated cytotoxicity. Most of cell lines and primary leukemia cells were highly resistant to TRAIL primarily owing to low cell-surface expression of death receptors in ALL and simultaneous expression of decoy receptors in AML. Nearly half of cell lines and majority of primary leukemia cells showed low sensitivity to FasL. These results suggest that resistance to death-inducing ligands, particularly to TRAIL, could be one of the mechanisms for a rapid clonal expansion and a poor sensitivity to the GVL effect in infant leukemias with MLL rearrangement.","['Inukai, T', 'Zhang, X', 'Goto, M', 'Hirose, K', 'Uno, K', 'Akahane, K', 'Nemoto, A', 'Goi, K', 'Sato, H', 'Takahashi, K', 'Honna, H', 'Kagami, K', 'Nakamoto, K', 'Yagita, H', 'Okumura, K', 'Koyama-Okazaki, T', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Sugita, K']","['Inukai T', 'Zhang X', 'Goto M', 'Hirose K', 'Uno K', 'Akahane K', 'Nemoto A', 'Goi K', 'Sato H', 'Takahashi K', 'Honna H', 'Kagami K', 'Nakamoto K', 'Yagita H', 'Okumura K', 'Koyama-Okazaki T', 'Nakazawa S', 'Sugita K']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan. tinukai@yamanashi.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/analysis', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', '*Tumor Escape']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404429 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404429 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2119-29. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404429.

We have investigated DNA repair in FLT3-ITD and wild-type (WT) cells. Using the comet assay, we have demonstrated that the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 significantly inhibits repair of DNA damage in the MV4-11-FLT3-ITD cell line and FLT3-ITD patient samples but not in the HL-60-FLT3-WT cell line or FLT3-WT patient samples. Following the discovery that transcript levels of the DNA repair gene RAD51 are significantly correlated with FLT3 transcript levels in FLT3-ITD patients, we further investigated the role of RAD51 in FLT3-ITD-AML. The reduction in DNA repair in PKC412-treated FLT3-ITD cells was shown to be associated with downregulation of RAD51 mRNA and protein expression and correlates with the maintenance of phosphorylated H2AX levels, implying that PKC412 inhibits the homologous recombination double-strand break repair pathway in FLT3-ITD cells. Using FLT3-short interfering RNA (siRNA), we also demonstrated that genetic silencing of FLT3 results in RAD51 downregulation in FLT3-ITD cells but not in FLT3-WT cells. This work suggests that the use of FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412 may reverse the drug-resistant phenotype of FLT3-ITD-AML cells by inhibiting repair of chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage and thereby reduce the risk of disease relapse.","['Seedhouse, C H', 'Hunter, H M', 'Lloyd-Lewis, B', 'Massip, A-M', 'Pallis, M', 'Carter, G I', 'Grundy, M', 'Shang, S', 'Russell, N H']","['Seedhouse CH', 'Hunter HM', 'Lloyd-Lewis B', 'Massip AM', 'Pallis M', 'Carter GI', 'Grundy M', 'Shang S', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Academic Haematology, School of Molecular Medical Sciences, Nottingham University Hospitals and University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. claire.seedhouse@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['*DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rad51 Recombinase/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404439 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404439 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2130-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404439.

Such mutations act in a dominant manner resulting in hyperproliferation but impaired differentiation in response to G-CSF. This is due, at least in part, to defective internalization and loss of binding sites for several negative regulators, leading to sustained receptor activation. However, those signaling pathways responsible for mediating the hyperproliferative function have remained unclear. In this study, analysis of an additional G-CSF-R mutant confirmed the importance of residues downstream of Box 2 as important contributors to the sustained proliferation. However, maximal proliferation correlated with the ability to robustly activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 in a sustained manner, whereas co-expression of dominant-negative STAT5, but not dominant-negative STAT3, was able to inhibit G-CSF-stimulated proliferation from a truncated receptor. Furthermore, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor also strongly reduced the proliferative response, whereas inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) or phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase reduced proliferation to a lesser degree. These data suggest that sustained JAK2/STAT5 activation is a major contributor to the hyperproliferative function of truncated G-CSF receptors, with pathways involving MEK and PI 3-kinase playing a reduced role.","['Gits, J', 'van Leeuwen, D', 'Carroll, H P', 'Touw, I P', 'Ward, A C']","['Gits J', 'van Leeuwen D', 'Carroll HP', 'Touw IP', 'Ward AC']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Janus Kinase 2/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404448 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404448 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2111-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404448.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may be especially amenable to TLR agonists because it is an immunologically susceptible tumor with strong expression of several TLRs, particularly TLR-7 and TLR-9. TLR agonists may indirectly clear CLL cells by enhancing the activity of natural killer and tumor-reactive T cells, or by altering the tumor microenvironment and inhibiting angiogenesis. However, signaling pathways can be activated directly in CLL cells by TLR-7 and TLR-9 agonists, leading to the production of cytokines and costimulatory molecules in a manner that is dependent on the underlying cytogenetic abnormalities, but rendering the tumor cells more sensitive to killing by cytotoxic T cells, immunotoxins and some chemotherapeutic drugs. Imidazoquinolines are TLR-7 agonists with strong local activity against CLL, and phase I trials of systemically administered imidazoquinolines (and also cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligonucleotides that are TLR-9 agonists) are currently ongoing at different centers. The potential importance of these TLR agonists in the treatment of CLL is suggested by their ability to sensitize tumor cells to cytotoxic agents, and their future probably lies in combination with radiotherapies, chemotherapies, monoclonal antibodies and cancer vaccines.","['Spaner, D E', 'Masellis, A']","['Spaner DE', 'Masellis A']","[""Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. david.spaner@swri.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinolones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/*agonists', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*agonists']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404456 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404456 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):53-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404456.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with measurable tumor who had received one previous chemotherapy or chemotherapy/radiation regimen were eligible. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) was administered i.v. over 30 min followed immediately by irinotecan 100 mg/m(2) i.v. over 90 min, both on days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Patients were stratified based on response to initial treatment [i.e. primary sensitive disease with progression >or=3 months (group A), or refractory disease (group B)]. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were enrolled but one never received treatment and one ineligible patient did not have SCLC. Median patient ages of the remaining patients were 61 and 63 years in groups A (n = 35) and B (n = 36), respectively, with performance status of 0 or 1 in 85% of 71 patients. Primary grade 3/4 toxic effects in groups A versus B were neutropenia (36% versus 43%), thrombocytopenia (36% versus 26%), nausea (12% versus 11%), vomiting (0 versus 11%), diarrhea (12% versus 9%), and pulmonary (12% versus 12%). Two patients had fatal events including pneumonitis (n = 1) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 1). Responses occurred in 11 group A [two complete responses and nine partial responses (PRs)] and four group B (all PRs) patients, for response rates of 31% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17%, 49%) and 11% (95% CI 3%, 26%), respectively. Median survival and progression-free survival times were 7.1 (95% CI 6, 10.5) versus 3.5 (95% CI 3.1, 5.7) months, and 3.1 (95% CI 1.6, 5.3) versus 1.6 (95% CI 1.4, 2.8) months for group A versus B. CONCLUSION: The irinotecan/gemcitabine combination is active and well tolerated as second-line therapy in SCLC patients. Additional studies are warranted as second-line therapy in patients who progressed 90 days or more after first-line therapy. However, the observed efficacy results in refractory SCLC patients indicate that this regimen should not be further explored in this population.","['Rocha-Lima, C M', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Lee, M E', 'Atkins, J N', 'Mauer, A', 'Vokes, E', 'Green, M R']","['Rocha-Lima CM', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Lee ME', 'Atkins JN', 'Mauer A', 'Vokes E', 'Green MR']","['University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA. crocha@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/05/09 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)37599-4 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdl375 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2007 Feb;18(2):331-7. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdl375.

The D816V substitution in the activation loop of KIT results in relative resistance to the kinase inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec). Because this mutation occurs in 80 to 95% of adult SM, its detection has diagnostic and predictive significance. Unfortunately, the fraction of mutation-positive cells in clinical SM samples is often below the 20 to 30% threshold needed for detection by direct DNA sequencing. We have developed an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay using a mutation-specific primer combined with a wild-type blocking oligonucleotide that amplifies D816V at the level of 1% mutant allele in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. There were no amplifications among 64 KIT wild-type tumors and cell lines, whereas all D816V-mutant samples (eight AML and 11 mast cell disease) were positive. Other D816 substitutions associated with resistance to imatinib in vitro are rare in SM. Among these D816F was detectable with the assay whereas D816H, D816Y, and D816G did not amplify. Nine biopsies (bone marrow, skin, or colon) with suspected SM were negative by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and/or DNA sequencing but positive by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Thus, the assay may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of SM.","['Corless, Christopher L', 'Harrell, Patina', 'Lacouture, Mario', 'Bainbridge, Troy', 'Le, Claudia', 'Gatter, Ken', 'White, Clifton Jr', 'Granter, Scott', 'Heinrich, Michael C']","['Corless CL', 'Harrell P', 'Lacouture M', 'Bainbridge T', 'Le C', 'Gatter K', 'White C Jr', 'Granter S', 'Heinrich MC']","['OHSU Dept. of Pathology (L471), 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd., Portland, OR 97239, USA. corlessc@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/01/16 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60351-0 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2006.060089 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2006 Nov;8(5):604-12. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2006.060089.,,,,PMC1876167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous research, we evidenced an imbalance of purine metabolism in B-CLL cells. Since the extracellular adenosine has been proved to induce apoptosis via A2b receptor, enzymes involved in adenosine metabolism could play an important role in apoptosis resistance of B-CLL cells. We prepared a microarray chip for the analysis of 50 selected genes that could be of interest in B-CLL: enzymes of purine de-novo, salvage and catabolic pathway, oxidative stress enzymes, and apoptotis-related proteins. Preliminary results identify many genes of purine metabolism that exhibit low or high expression, while genes involved in signal transduction and apoptosis exhibit lower alterations even if of remarkable interest. This application of microarray technique seems promising and at least a subset of these genes will be valid candidates for further studies.","['Marinello, E', 'Carlucci, F', 'Rosi, F', 'Floccari, F', 'Raspadori, D', 'Tabucchi, A']","['Marinello E', 'Carlucci F', 'Rosi F', 'Floccari F', 'Raspadori D', 'Tabucchi A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrine-Metabolic Sciences and Biochemistry, University of Siena, Siena, Italy. carlucci@unisi.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Purines)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Purines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['N268677M82180071 [pii]', '10.1080/01457630600890545 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2006;25(9-11):1277-81. doi: 10.1080/01457630600890545.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that the naturally occurring tetrapeptide Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) is a potent angiogenic factor normally present at nanomolar concentrations in the blood. A murine leukemia model was used to assess whether there was a correlation between levels of endogenous AcSDKP and the development of disease. Levels of AcSDKP in the plasma and bone marrow (BM) cells from mice bearing an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were five- to ten-fold greater than those in non-leukemic mice. Furthermore, a strong correlation between the concentration of endogenous AcSDKP and the progression of AML was demonstrated. These results are consistent with the marked increase in BM vascularity observed in leukemic mice. The physiologic relevance of these findings awaits further studies and the contribution of AcSDKP to the pathogenesis of leukemia is under investigation.","['Liu, Jian-Miao', 'Bignon, Jerome', 'Ilic, Vesna', 'Briscoe, Cecilia', 'Lallemand, Jean-Yves', 'Riches, Andrew', 'Wdzieczak-Bakala, Joanna']","['Liu JM', 'Bignon J', 'Ilic V', 'Briscoe C', 'Lallemand JY', 'Riches A', 'Wdzieczak-Bakala J']","['Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 91198 Gif-sur-Yvette, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*blood/pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology', 'Oligopeptides/*blood/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology']",2006/10/27 09:00,2006/12/22 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['K06311673730L117 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600688131 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Sep;47(9):1915-20. doi: 10.1080/10428190600688131.,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Sep;47(9):1732-3.

In the BEACOPP regimen, treatment intervals were shortened and the dose-intensity was increased compared with those in the ABVD regimen (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and darcarbacine), resulting in a long-term disease-free survival rate of approximately 75-80%. In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the BEACOPP regimen. Between April 2001 and February 2004, 20 patients with HL of stage IIB or higher who had received no previous treatment were enrolled. The patients were aged 17-69 years (median 22 years). The histologic types were mixed cellularity in four cases and nodular sclerosis in 16 cases. The stages were stage IIB in four cases, stage III in 12 cases, and stage IV in four cases. Nineteen (95%) of the 20 patients achieved complete remission. The 3-year survival rate was 100% and the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 89.7%. Adverse drug reactions were grade 4 neutropenia in 12 patients, grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in seven patients, and grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicities in two patients (stomatitis in one patient and ALT/AST elevation in one patient). The BEACOPP regimen for advanced-stage HL showed an excellent complete remission rate and high efficacy even in stage III/IV patients. However, a long-term risk of the BEACOPP regimen is the development of secondary leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Therefore, long-term follow-up of these patients, including monitoring for toxicities, is necessary.","['Niitsu, Nozomi', 'Okamoto, Masataka', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Aoki, Sadao', 'Tamaru, Jun-ichi', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Hirano, Masami']","['Niitsu N', 'Okamoto M', 'Tomita N', 'Aoki S', 'Tamaru J', 'Miura I', 'Hirano M']","['Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical University, 38 Morohongo, Moroyama, Iruma-Gun, Saitama, Japan. nniitsu@saitama-med.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'BEACOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dacarbazine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/classification/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Procarbazine/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2006/10/27 09:00,2006/12/22 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['K517VVLJ566Q2362 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600688313 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Sep;47(9):1908-14. doi: 10.1080/10428190600688313.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a retrospective, multi-center cohort study of all HIV-1-infected patients diagnosed with BL/BLL between 1990 - 2004. Patients were assigned to two different chemotherapy approaches. Group A received a protocol which was adapted from the German multi-center study group for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (GMALL). Group B received a conventional CHOP-based chemotherapy. Fifty-one patients were included in the analysis. In group A (n = 20), significantly more patients achieved complete remission (75% vs 40%, P = 0.02) than in group B (n = 31). One-year survival in group A was 65% compared to 44% in group B (P = 0.17). In a multi-variable Cox regression analysis, treatment according to the GMALL protocol was significantly associated with prolonged survival with a relative hazard rate of 0.13 (95% CI 0.03 - 0.63, P = 0.01). In conclusion, the short and intensive GMALL protocol for B-ALL/NHL is feasible in patients with AIDS-BL/BLL. Outcome may be improved compared to patients treated with CHOP-based regimens.

This study examined whether pegfilgrastim was safe and lead to similar kinetics of neutrophil recovery as daily granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Using retrospective analysis, patients receiving pegfilgrastim (6 mg) were matched with controls (G-CSF 5 microg kg-1 per day) for a cycle of chemotherapy, prior chemotherapy, dose of cytarabine received, age (<60 or >60 years), diagnosis and bone marrow involvement. The primary endpoint was duration of grade IV neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, ANC < 500 microl-1). Secondary endpoints included time to neutrophil recovery, incidence of febrile neutropenia, positive blood cultures and delay in subsequent chemotherapy. This study identified 124 pegfilgrastim supported cycles in 43 patients and successfully matched them to 124 G-CSF supported cycles from 38 patients treated between January 1999 and July 2005. There were no significant differences between pegfilgrastim and G-CSF groups in baseline or treatment-related variables. The median duration of grade IV neutropenia was 4 days in both groups (P = 0.55). Time to neutrophil recovery, incidence of febrile neutropenia, positive blood cultures and delay in subsequent chemotherapy were similar in both groups. Once per cycle dosing of pegfilgrastim appears safe and as effective as daily G-CSF for supporting the hyper-CVAD chemotherapy regimen.","['Lane, Steven W', 'Crawford, Julie', 'Kenealy, Melita', 'Cull, Gavin', 'Seymour, John F', 'Prince, H Miles', 'Marlton, Paula', 'Gill, Devinder', 'Mollee, Peter N']","['Lane SW', 'Crawford J', 'Kenealy M', 'Cull G', 'Seymour JF', 'Prince HM', 'Marlton P', 'Gill D', 'Mollee PN']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Ipswich Road, Woolloongabba, Brisbane, Australia 4102. steven_lane@health.qld.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A58010674 (pegfilgrastim)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Safety', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2006/10/27 09:00,2006/12/22 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['H52423418J4KL8UJ [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600632832 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Sep;47(9):1813-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190600632832.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed biopsy samples from two indolent B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL), that have transformed to diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We correlated the presence or absence of DNA-mismatch repair enzymes by immunostaining as well as the p53 status to smoking history. Of all patients (n = 30), 37% showed negative immunostaining of MLH1, 16% showed negative immunostaining of MSH2 and 63% had p53 mutations and/or protein expression. Eighteen out of 20 transformed follicular lymphomas and seven out of 10 CLL/SLL that have transformed to DLBCL (Richter's syndrome) were informative for smoking histories. We found that the relative risk of negative immunostaining for either MLH1 or MSH2 was 2.2 times higher in smokers than non-smokers (relative risk = 2.2041, 95% confidence interval: 0.89714, 5.41491).

We therefore evaluated the frequency and clinical relevance of FLT3 aberrations in a series of Korean APL patients. We assayed FLT3 ITD and D835 mutation status in 75 newly diagnosed APL patients and we correlated the presence of these mutations with clinical parameters and outcomes. Of the 75 patients, fifteen (20.0%) carried FLT3 mutations, nine (12.0%) with FLT3 ITD, seven (9.3%) with D835 mutations and one with both types. Patients presenting with higher leukocyte counts (>10 x 10(9)/L) had a significantly higher frequency of FLT3 ITD (P = 0.030). There was no association between FLT3 aberrations and other clinicohematologic features including age, gender, M3 variant morphology and PML/RARalpha subtype. Death at presentation before induction chemotherapy was significantly more frequent in patients with ITD than in those without ITD (33.3% vs. 4.5%, P = 0.020), but was not significantly related to the presence of D835 mutations (28.6% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.094). Both ITD and D835 mutations were associated with shortened event-free survival (P = 0.048 and P = 0.029, respectively), but there was no correlation between disease-free survival among the 61 patients who achieved complete remission and the presence of FLT3 mutations (P = 0.543 for ITD and P = 0.277 for D835). FLT3 mutations were less frequent in Korean APL patients than in Western APL patients. In Korean patients, however, FLT3 mutations were associated with higher leukemic burdens and early deaths before remission resulting in inferior prognosis.","['Yoo, Soo Jin', 'Park, Chan Jeoung', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Seo, Eul-Ju', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Chi, Hyun Sook']","['Yoo SJ', 'Park CJ', 'Jang S', 'Seo EJ', 'Lee KH', 'Chi HS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sanggye Paik Hospital, Inje University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2006/10/27 09:00,2006/12/22 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['K55355401125XH56 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600687927 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Sep;47(9):1788-93. doi: 10.1080/10428190600687927.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THDB was found to inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis showed G2/M phase arrest in HL-60 cells following 48 h exposure to THDB. Analysis of the cell cycle regulatory proteins demonstrated that THDB did not change the steady-state levels of cyclin B1, cyclin E, Cdk1 and Cdc25C, but decreased the protein levels of Cdk2 and cyclin A. THDB also caused a marked increase in apoptosis, as characterized by DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder and sub G1 formation), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, which was associated with activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Moreover, the THDB-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated in the presence of specific inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9.

Over the last four years there has been considerable progress in our understanding of DS AMKL. Like other childhood leukaemias DS AMKL is initiated in utero and can present in the neonatal period as a clinically overt preleukaemic condition, transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD). In addition to trisomy 21, fetal haemopoietic progenitors acquire N-terminal truncating mutations in the key megakaryocyte-erythroid transcription factor GATA1. These are the minimum required events for TMD to develop. In approximately 30% of TMD patients, additional as yet unidentified (epi)genetic mutations are required for progression to AMKL. Thus, DS TMD and AMKL provide a unique model of childhood leukaemia where the preleukaemic and leukaemic phases are ascertainable and separable allowing distinct steps in leukaemogenesis to be studied individually. These findings also have implications for the clinical management of DS TMD and AMKL specifically and also of childhood leukaemia more generally.","['Vyas, Paresh', 'Roberts, Irene']","['Vyas P', 'Roberts I']","['Department of Haematology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital and University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. paresh.vyas@imm.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Early Hum Dev,Early human development,7708381,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Child', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/physiopathology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-3782(06)00252-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2006.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Early Hum Dev. 2006 Dec;82(12):767-73. doi: 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2006.09.016.

Among the other five sheep having more than 2% of BLV-infected cells among PBMC at 12 weeks post infection, four sheep developed B-cell leukemia or lymphoma within 2 years after infection.

METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics (CC) and karyotype analysis were conducted on the bone marrow cells from 58 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), 47 adults (aged 15 approximately 67) and 11 children (aged 1 approximately 14). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes of the chromosomes 1, 5, 11, 16, 17, and 21 was performed. A total of 58 patients were included in this study. Forty-seven of these patients with AML were adults and the remaining were children. Both conventional cytogenetics (CC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were carried out. FISH analysis was performed utilizing commercially available DNA probes, including whole chromosome painting probes, locus specific probes, and specific and dual color/multiple color translocation fusion probes. RESULTS: Six out of the 58 patients (10.3%) were found to have MLL gene rearrangements, either an extra signal of MLL gene or a disruption of MLL gene due to a translocation or deletion or duplication. Of these six patients with MLL gene rearrangements, four were adults and two were children. In addition to MLL gene rearrangements, complex chromosomal changes were also detected in five of these patients: 47 - 49, XX, der (1) t (1; 17) (p36.1; q23), +4, +10, der (11) t (11; 17) (q23; q23), -17, -18, +20, +21?. ish +21 (wcp21+), der (1) t (1; 17) (wcp17+), der (11) t (11; 17) (wcp11+; wcp17+); 46, XX, del (5) (q13q33), r (11) (p15q25), +r (11) (p15q25). ishr (11) (wcp11+, MLL+), +r (11) (wcp11+, MLL+); 46, XY, del (11) (q23) [2]/46, idem, add (16) (p13.1) [8]/46, XY [10]. ishadd (16) (wcp16+), rea (11) (wcp11+); 55, XY, + markers, ish 11q23 (MLL x 3), +21 (wcp21+); and 46, XY, add (11) (q23) [6]/46, idem, t (15; 17) (q22; q21) [12]/46, XY [2]. ish dup (11) (MLL++), t (15; 17) (PML+, RARa+; RARa-) [24]. CONCLUSION: MLL gene rearrangement is relatively common in AML patients.

METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) from CML patients were cultured initially using multiple cytokine combinations as follows: recombined human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (rhGM-CSF) plus recombined human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) as control groups, rhGM-CSF plus rhIL-4 and STI571 as experimental groups, and from day 8 added recombined human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rhTNF-alpha) for stimulating maturation. The morphologic features of cells were observed by Wright's staining, Cytogenetic analysis was performed by Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry, and the functions of antigen-presenting were assayed by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The concentration of VEGF was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-kappaB activation was evaluated by TransAM(TM) ELISA kit. RESULTS: CML experimental groups treated with STI571 displayed features in morphology which were similar to those of control groups with delicate membrane projections. FISH confirmed the DC of both CML groups were leukemic origin. In comparison with the CML control groups, the CML experimental groups showed an increased expression of CD80, CD86, CD83 and HLA-DR and showed more intense abilities of allogeneic antigen presentation. The concentration of VEGF was dramatically reduced, and yet NF-kappaB activation was increased in experimental groups. CONCLUSION: STI571 could promote the activation/maturation of DC derived from BMMNCs of patients with CML in vitro, which might be partially responsible for the fact that the inhibitory effect of VEGF on DC NF-kappaB activation was relieved through STI571 inhibiting the overproduction of VEGF in CML.","['Zheng, Shui-er', 'Jin, Jie', 'Tong, Xiang-min']","['Zheng SE', 'Jin J', 'Tong XM']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University Medical College, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'B7-2 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Aug 29;86(32):2252-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Human Ph+ CML leukemia K562 cells, which express endogenous p210 bcr/abl protein, were cultured in RPMI 1640 and treated with berbamine as indicated time and dose. Flow cytometry (FCM) and Annexin-V-Fluos/PI staining kit were used to evaluate the apoptosis of leukemic cells; FCM and cytoperm/cytofix plus Caspase-3-McAb-PE were employed to measure the leukemic cells with activated Caspase-3. Phosphorylation of p210 bcr/abl protein in the leukemic cells were assessed by a combination of immunoprecipitation (IP) with c-abl antibody and Western blotting with p-Tyr (pY99) antibody. The protein levels of p210 bcr/abl, Hsp90 and Hsp70 in the leukemic cells were determined by Western blotting with antibodies to c-abl, Hsp90, and Hsp70 respectively. RESULTS: After treatment with berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 48 h, the percentages of leukemic cells expressing activated caspase-3 and apoptotic cells were 45.69% and 48.43% respectively. IP and WB results showed that berbamine at low concentration markedly inhibited phosphorylation of p210 bcr/abl protein in the leukemia cells, and the amount of phosphorylated p210 bcr/abl in the leukemia cells exposed to berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 6 h were only 8.41% of that of untreated leukemia cells without the protein levels of p210 bcr/abl down-regulated. Significantly, berbamine also down-regulated chaperone Hsp90 protein, and the amount of Hsp90 protein in the leukemia cells treated with berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 48 h accounted for 18.37% of that of the untreated leukemia cells. Berbamine at 8 microg/ml had no obvious effect on chaperone Hsp70 protein expression associated with the resistance of leukemia cells to apoptosis. CONCLUSION: (1) Berbamine induces caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of Ph+ leukemia cells through inhibiting phosphorylation of p210 bcr/abl protein and down-regulating its chaperone Hsp90 protein. (2) Unlike Hsp90 inhibitor GA that upregulates Hsp70, berbamine has no obvious effect on chaperone Hsp70 protein expression in leukemia cells, suggesting that berbamine may be a novel class of Hsp90 inhibitor, and further study is required.","['Sun, Jian-rong', 'Zhang, Xiao-hong', 'He, Zhi-wen', 'Gu, Ying', 'Yu, Ying-zi', 'Fang, Yong-ming', 'Lu, Qing-hua', 'Dong, Qing-hua', 'Xu, Rong-zhen']","['Sun JR', 'Zhang XH', 'He ZW', 'Gu Y', 'Yu YZ', 'Fang YM', 'Lu QH', 'Dong QH', 'Xu RZ']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'V5KM4XJ0WM (berbamine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*therapeutic use', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/metabolism', 'Phytotherapy', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2006/10/27 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2006/10/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Aug 29;86(32):2246-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting BCR-ABL by imatinib has revolutionised the clinical course of CML. All patients in early chronic phase treated with imatinib achieve a complete haematological response, with 80-90% achieving a complete cytogenetic response. However, BCR-ABL transcripts remain detectable in the great majority of them, and approximately 16% chronic phase CML patients are resistant to or relapse after imatinib treatment, mainly through pre-existing or acquired point mutations in the binding pocket. Thus, other targeted approaches are being developed to overcome imatinib resistance. These include two novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (nilotinib and dasatinib) that are producing clinical responses in different clinical settings, while other similar compounds are under evaluation in preclinical studies. Furthermore, additive immunotherapeutic strategies are emerging to synergise with imatinib in the elimination of molecular residual disease.

This abnormality creates a fusion gene, 5' core binding factor beta (CBF-beta) gene and the 3' MYH11 gene, the latter encoding smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene (SMMHC). Detection of this abnormality is important for diagnosis and is most commonly done by cytogenetics or molecular methods. In this study, we determined the utility of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence methods using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (AH107) against the C-terminus of the CBFbeta-SMMHC chimeric protein for diagnosis of AML-M4Eo. Thirty-nine AML-M4Eo cases and 55 cases of other types of AML were evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis of routinely processed paraffin-embedded bone marrow sections showed that CBFbeta-SMMHC staining is predominantly nuclear in all cases of AML-M4Eo and is not nuclear in other AML types. Four cases of AML-M4Eo double-stained for CBFbeta-SMMHC and CD34 showed the fusion protein in CD34-positive blasts. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of fresh bone marrow aspirate smears showed that AML-M4Eo blasts have a distinct nuclear microgranular or fine-speckled pattern of staining, with or without faint cytoplasmic staining. By contrast, other types of AML and normal bone marrow specimens were either negative or had a nonspecific pattern of staining. In summary, immunostaining for CBFbeta-SMMHC using either immunohistochemical or immunofluorescense analysis as described here reveals a distinctive pattern of staining for AML-M4Eo. This approach is a specific, reliable, and convenient alternative to cytogenetic and molecular methods for the diagnosis of AML-M4Eo and may be particularly helpful in cases with indeterminate histologic features or in cases in which cytogenetic and molecular studies are either uninformative or not available.","['Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Claxton, David F', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Lu, Di', 'Vadhan-Raj, Saroj', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Nguyen, Martin H', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Zhao W', 'Claxton DF', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Lu D', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Nguyen MH', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2006/10/26 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/10/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.pas.0000213301.19273.66 [doi]', '00000478-200611000-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2006 Nov;30(11):1436-44. doi: 10.1097/01.pas.0000213301.19273.66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the incidence and mechanism of arrythmogenesis caused by As(2)O(3). METHODS AND RESULTS: Standard 12-lead ECGs were monitored throughout As(2)O(3) therapy in 20 APL patients. As(2)O (3) (0.15 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the corrected QT interval (QTc: 445+/-7 to 517+/-17 ms, means+/-SE, p<0.01), and also increased the QTc dispersion and transmural dispersion of repolarization. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardias and torsades de pointes occurred in 4 and 1 patients, respectively. The action potentials and isometric contraction were measured in guinea pig papillary muscles during As(2)O (3) perfusion (350 micromol/L). The action potential duration was prolonged (APD(90): 150+/-11 to 195+/-12 ms at 60 min, p<0.01, n=5) and perfusion of As(2)O(3) in a low K(+) solution with a low stimulation rate augmented the prolongation of APD, and provoked early after-depolarizations and triggered activities. The prolonged exposure to As(2)O(3) induced muscle contracture, aftercontractions, triggered activities and electromechanical alternans. Tetrodotoxin or butylated hydroxytoluene partially prevented the As(2)O(3)-induced prolongation of APD. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged QTc and spatial heterogeneity are responsible for the As(2)O(3)-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In addition to prolongation of the APD, cellular Ca(2+) overload and lipid peroxidation might contribute to the electrophysiological abnormalities caused by As(2)O(3).","['Yamazaki, Keisuke', 'Terada, Hajime', 'Satoh, Hiroshi', 'Naito, Kensuke', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Uehara, Akihiko', 'Katoh, Hideki', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Hayashi, Hideharu']","['Yamazaki K', 'Terada H', 'Satoh H', 'Naito K', 'Takeshita A', 'Uehara A', 'Katoh H', 'Ohnishi K', 'Hayashi H']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Cardiology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Handayama, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Circ J,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,101137683,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Poisons)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', '4368-28-9 (Tetrodotoxin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Butylated Hydroxytoluene/pharmacology', 'Electrocardiography/drug effects', 'Electrophysiology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/physiology', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Myocardial Contraction/drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Papillary Muscles/drug effects/*physiology', 'Poisons/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tetrodotoxin/pharmacology']",2006/10/26 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/circj/70.1407 [pii]', '10.1253/circj.70.1407 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ J. 2006 Nov;70(11):1407-14. doi: 10.1253/circj.70.1407.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of leukemic MLL fusions is believed to be directly contributing to the conversion of normal bone marrow cells into leukemic cancer cells. However, the mechanism of this process has not been fully elucidated. We have recently found that the MLL leukemic fusions can abolish the activity of P53 tumor suppressor protein that actively guards against the appearance of cancer by instructing damaged cells to self-destruct. In contrast to the vast majority of cancers where p53 gene is mutated, very few p53 mutations have been found in leukemias. Our findings suggest that leukemic fusions contribute to disease progression, at least in part, by suppressing the function of P53, which,if proven,may present a novel opportunity to re-activating the P53 pathway in leukemic cells thereby identifying a rational therapeutic approach for managing leukemias where MLL fusions are detected.","['Wiederschain, Dmitri', 'Yuan, Zhi-min']","['Wiederschain D', 'Yuan ZM']","['Department of Genetics and Complex Diseases, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

IFNs dramatically increase the transcription of the PML gene. In this study, we have shown that the response of 2 structural PML NB components, PML and Sp100, to interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) was suppressed in cells simultaneously treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (trichostatin A, sodium butyrate, MS-275, SAHA, and valproic acid). Trichostatin A (TSA) blocked the increase of PML NB number and suppressed up-regulation of PML mRNA and protein levels in several human cell lines and in normal diploid skin fibroblasts. Moreover, IFNalpha induction of IRF-1 was also inhibited by TSA, although incompletely. Analysis of cellular fractions did not show any defects in cytoplasmic-nuclear transport of STAT2, a component of transcription factor ISGF3 responsible for IFNalpha/beta-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that after IFNalpha stimulation STAT2 binds to ISRE element of PML promoter even in the presence of TSA and thus excluded STAT2-dependent mechanism of TSA effect. These results indicate that the action of histone deacetylases is necessary for the full transcriptional activation of IFNalpha-stimulated genes.","['Vlasakova, Jana', 'Novakova, Zora', 'Rossmeislova, Lenka', 'Kahle, Michal', 'Hozak, Pavel', 'Hodny, Zdenek']","['Vlasakova J', 'Novakova Z', 'Rossmeislova L', 'Kahle M', 'Hozak P', 'Hodny Z']","['Department of Cell Ultrastructure and Molecular Biology, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Biology of the Cell Nucleus, Institute of Molecular Genetics [corrected] Academy Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2006/10/26 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41975-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-02-003418 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 15;109(4):1373-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-02-003418.

To address this, we have generated mice conditionally lacking Mcl-1 expression in neutrophils and macrophages. We show that Mcl-1 conditional knockout mice had a severe defect in neutrophil survival, whereas macrophage survival was normal. The granulocyte compartment in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow of Mcl-1 conditional knockout mice exhibited an approximately 2- to 3-fold higher apoptotic rate than control cells.

IM treatment was associated with no increase in early hepatotoxicity or engraftment delay after HCT compared with the historical cohort. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the IM-treated cohort compared with the historical cohort with regard to overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality. For chronic-phase (CP) patients, IM response prior to HCT was associated with post-HCT outcome. Patients who underwent transplantation in CP with a suboptimal response or a loss of response on IM had a statistically significant higher hazard of mortality when compared with CP patients who achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) or major cytogenetic response (MCR) on IM (HR=5.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-25.05, P=.03). These data indicate that pre-HCT IM is not associated with increased transplant-related morbidity (TRM) or poorer outcomes. However, patients with a suboptimal or loss of IM response before HCT do worse, suggesting a more aggressive disease course for these patients.","['Oehler, Vivian G', 'Gooley, Ted', 'Snyder, David S', 'Johnston, Laura', 'Lin, Allen', 'Cummings, Carrie C', 'Chu, Su', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Negrin, Robert S', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Oehler VG', 'Gooley T', 'Snyder DS', 'Johnston L', 'Lin A', 'Cummings CC', 'Chu S', 'Bhatia R', 'Forman SJ', 'Negrin RS', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Radich JP']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. voehler@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/10/26 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42025-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-031682 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 15;109(4):1782-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-031682.

Myeloma bone disease is characterized by both increased osteoclast activity and suppressed new bone formation. The basis for both the increased bone destruction and decreased bone formation has been a topic of extensive investigation during the last several years. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Marrow samples from patients with myeloma were screened by both molecular biological and gene expression profiling techniques to identify factors that may be responsible for the enhanced bone destruction and suppressed bone formation in patients with the disease. RESULTS: Several novel factors have been identified that directly stimulate osteoclastic bone destruction in myeloma. These include receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand, macrophage inflammatory peptide 1alpha, and interleukin (IL)-3. All of these factors are increased in most patients with myeloma. Furthermore, osteoprotegerin levels are markedly suppressed, further driving osteoclast formation. In addition, four novel inhibitors of osteoblast differentiation or activity have been identified. These include two inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway, DKK1 and soluble frizzled protein 2. The Wnt signaling pathway is critical for osteoblast differentiation. Two cytokines, IL-3 and IL-7, have also been reported that directly or indirectly inhibit osteoblast differentiation in patients with myeloma. Interestingly, increased macrophage inflammatory peptide 1alpha, IL-3, and IL-7 result from abnormal transcriptional regulation of these genes by increased levels of acute myelogenous leukemia-1 to acute myelogenous leukemia-1B transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: The recent identification of novel stimulators of osteoclast activity and inhibitors of osteoblast differentiation provide new therapeutic targets for treating this devastating bone disease in patients with myeloma.","['Roodman, G David']",['Roodman GD'],"['Department of Medicine/Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh and VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Medicine/Hematology-Oncology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15240, USA. roodmangd@upmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Diseases/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'Osteoclasts/cytology']",2006/10/26 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/20/6270s [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0845 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 15;12(20 Pt 2):6270s-6273s. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0845.,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide the first evidence that hypoxia inhibits transgene expression driven by the Moloney murine leukemia virus-long terminal repeats (MoMLV-LTR) in IFN-gamma-activated Mphi. Hypoxia silenced the expression of several MoMLV-LTR-driven genes, including v-myc, enhanced green fluorescence protein, and env, and was effective in different mouse Mphi cell lines and on distinct MoMLV backbone-based viruses. Down-regulation of MoMLV mRNA occurred at the transcriptional level and was associated with decreased retrovirus production, as determined by titration experiments, suggesting that hypoxia may control MoMLV retroviral spread through the suppression of LTR activity. In contrast, genes driven by the CMV or the SV40 promoter were up-regulated or unchanged by hypoxia, indicating a selective inhibitory activity on the MoMLV promoter. It is interesting that hypoxia was ineffective in suppressing MoMLV-LTR-controlled gene expression in T or fibroblast cell lines, suggesting a Mphi lineage-selective action. Finally, we found that MoMLV-mediated gene expression in Mphi was also inhibited by picolinic acid, a tryptophan catabolite with hypoxia-like activity and Mphi-activating properties, suggesting a pathophysiological role of this molecule in viral resistance and its possible use as an antiviral agent.","['Puppo, Maura', 'Bosco, Maria Carla', 'Federico, Maurizio', 'Pastorino, Sandra', 'Varesio, Luigi']","['Puppo M', 'Bosco MC', 'Federico M', 'Pastorino S', 'Varesio L']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Padiglione 2, L go Gerolamo Gaslini 5, 16147 Genova Quarto, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Picolinic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'QZV2W997JQ (picolinic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/*genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*genetics/immunology', 'Picolinic Acids/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/drug effects/genetics/immunology']",2006/10/26 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2006/10/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0506361 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0506361 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2007 Feb;81(2):528-38. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0506361.

METHODS: The clinical outcomes of 16 patients receiving unrelated PBSC graft mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were compared with 30 patients receiving unrelated BM transplantation. RESULTS: Engraftment was achieved in 97.83% of the total patients. Compared with BM transplantation group, PBSC graft contained significantly more nucleated cells (P=0.000), resulting in a significantly shorter time-to-neutrophil (16.21-/+3.09 vs 12.81-/+4.15 days, P=0.003) and platelet engraftment (20.31-/+7.19 vs 15.50-/+6.91 days, P=0.035). T cell reconstitution differed little between the two groups at different time points after transplantation. The incidences of early-stage infection were 37.50% and 50.00% (P=0.644) in the PBSC and BM groups, respectively. In PBSC and BM groups, the incidences of grades I to IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) were 56.25% and 70.00% (P=0.456), 18.75% and 13.79% (P=0.661) for grades III to IV aGVHD, and 30.77% and 36.36% (P=0.413) for chronic GVHD (cGVHD), respectively. The nonrelapse transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates were 18.75% in PBSC group and 33.33% in BM group (P=0.295). The relapse occurred in 18.75% and 6.90% (P=0.226) of the patients in the two groups, respectively, and the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 62.19% and 56.23% (P=0.615), respectively. CONCLUSION: G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs allow more rapid engraftment in unrelated donor recipients in comparison with conventional BM, but T cell reconstitution and the incidence of infection between the two groups differ little, nor are there significant differences in the incidence or severity of aGVHD and cGVHD, nonrelapse TRM or 2-year DFS rates between the two groups.","['Fan, Zhi-ping', 'Yang, Kai', 'Liu, Qi-fa', 'Sun, Jing', 'Xu, Dan', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Wei, Yong-qiang', 'Ye, Chang-xiong', 'Jiang, Qian-li', 'Meng, Fan-yi']","['Fan ZP', 'Yang K', 'Liu QF', 'Sun J', 'Xu D', 'Zhang Y', 'Wei YQ', 'Ye CX', 'Jiang QL', 'Meng FY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. fanzp@fimmu.com']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/10/26 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2006/10/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2006 Oct;26(10):1494-7, 1512.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors focus on the two most common malignancies of childhood: leukemias and brain tumors. The literature review is structured so as to separate out earlier studies, generally those published prior to 1995, as opposed to manuscripts that have been published within the past decade. This is an important distinction for both leukemia and brain tumors. Earlier studies were ground breaking in that they began to map out what could be expected in terms of intelligence and academic problems in survivors of pediatric malignancies. Survivorship in this population has and continues to markedly increase and this is largely due to changes in treatment protocols. Research on neurocognitive effects of disease and treatment in pediatric oncology has become increasingly sophisticated, and this literature review not only reflects this trend, but highlights the growing collaboration between neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, and neuro-imaging. Thus, our goal was to provide a historical foundation, lead the reader towards the progression of research methodology up to the current state of the art, and perhaps most importantly, discuss future directions.

Many of these long-term effects involve the central nervous system (CNS) and are developmental in the way that they emerge over time. Because we are now able to observe the natural history of childhood diseases such as sickle cell anemia or HIV, or the consequences of treatment of disease such as leukemia, brain tumors, or kidney disease, we are also able to study a number of biological mechanisms that result in long-term neurocognitive impairment. While some of the neurodevelopmental outcomes can be directly linked to structural damage of the CNS, other systems (e.g., hematologic, immunologic, pulmonary) appear to play crucial indirect roles in the development of the CNS and neurocognitive abilities because of the way that they affect the course of brain development and activity of the brain across time. Important interactions between acute disease factors, biological mechanisms, age at the time of disease or treatment effect, and disruptions in patterns of development after successful treatment or management all provide support for a neurodevelopmental model of childhood chronic illness. Testing this model may make it possible to more accurately predict the timing and degree of severity of long-term neurodevelopmental consequences, provide guidance for improved treatment and prevention, and offer better understanding of neurodevelopmental disruptions that occur in other non-chronic illness related disabilities.","['Armstrong, F Daniel']",['Armstrong FD'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Mailman Center for Child Development, University of Miami Leonard M.

It seems that the prognostic value of cytogenetic changes is related to differences in cellular drug resistance in ALL and, to lesser extent, in AML. Genetic profiling based on microarray analysis confirms the correlation between cytogenetic changes in leukemic cells and drug resistance in ALL.

Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) recognize human leukocyte antigen C and B epitopes on target cells, thereby regulating NK cell activity. The KIR genes are polymorphic and two broad haplotypes exist: KIR-haplotype A mainly encode for inhibitory receptors and only for one activating (KIR2DS4), whereas the group B haplotype encodes more for activating KIRs (KIR2DS1, KIR2DS2, KIR2DS3, KIR2DS5 und KIR3DS1). METHODS: The impact of KIR ligand mismatch on the number of activating and inhibitory donor KIR genes and on KIR-haplotype was studied on outcome of 142 patients with leukemia, who received standard myeloablative conditioning followed by in vivo T-cell depleted (ATG) unrelated SCT. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis KIR ligand mismatch had significantly higher treatment related mortality (RR 2.206, P = 0.03), resulting in reduced overall (RR 2.015, P = 0.02) and disease-free survival (RR 1.924, P = 0.03). In contrast, SCT from donors with group A haplotype (P = 0.003) or with low number of activating KIR genes (P = 0.005) resulted in reduced relapse rate with improved disease-fee survival (P = 0.04). This effect was seen only in acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome and to a less extent in chronic myeloid leukemia. No effect was seen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: After in vivo T-cell depleted (ATG) unrelated stem cell transplantation with donors carrying low number of activating KIR genes (group A KIR haplotype), the risk of relapse is reduced and resulted in a significantly better disease-free survival.","['Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Binder, Thomas', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Wolschke, Christine', 'Schieder, Heike', 'Renges, Helmut', 'Ayuk, Francis', 'Dahlke, Joachim', 'Eiermann, Thomas', 'Zander, Axel']","['Kroger N', 'Binder T', 'Zabelina T', 'Wolschke C', 'Schieder H', 'Renges H', 'Ayuk F', 'Dahlke J', 'Eiermann T', 'Zander A']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DS1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR3DS1', 'Risk', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods']",2006/10/25 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/25 09:00'],"['2006/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000235859.24513.43 [doi]', '00007890-200610270-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2006 Oct 27;82(8):1024-30. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000235859.24513.43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch is a transmembrane receptor that regulates developmental processes and cell-fate decision. Histamine is used as an adjunct to immunotherapy in myelogenous leukemia, and regulates hematopoietic cell development. Thus, we investigated the effects of histamine on immunophenotype and Notch signaling in human HL-60 leukemia cells. Histamine (0.1-10 microM) inhibited the colony-forming efficiency of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent fashion and shifted the growth curve to the right. HL-60 cells were treated with histamine 0.1-1.0 microM for 6 days, and surface molecules were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histamine decreased CD49d positive cells by 74% while increasing CD31 positive cells by 53% as compared to controls. Histamine did not affect the expression of CD11b, CD14, CD34, CD44, CD54, CD49e, and CD62L. To examine Notch signaling in histamine-induced immunophenotype alterations in HL-60 cells, total RNA was isolated, purified, and subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis. The expressions of Notch1, Notch4, the ligands Jagged1, Delta4, and the downstream hairy enhancer of split 1 gene (HES1) were not significantly altered by histamine. In summary, this study demonstrated that histamine inhibited HL-60 cell growth and regulated immunophenotypes of CD49d and CD31.

Furthermore, TDG was found to potentiate CBP/p300-dependent transcription and serve as a substrate for CBP/p300 acetylation. Here, we show that the small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) protein binding activity of TDG is essential for activation of CBP and localization to promyelocytic leukemia protein oncogenic domains (PODs). SUMO-1 binding is mediated by two distinct amino- and carboxy-terminal motifs (residues 144 to 148 and 319 to 322) that are negatively regulated by DNA binding via an amino-terminal hydrophilic region (residues 1 to 121). TDG is also posttranslationally modified by covalent conjugation of SUMO-1 (sumoylation) to lysine 341. Interestingly, we found that sumoylation of TDG blocks interaction with CBP and prevents TDG acetylation in vitro. Furthermore, sumoylation effectively abrogates intermolecular SUMO-1 binding and a sumoylation-deficient mutant accumulates in PODs, suggesting that sumoylation negatively regulates translocation to these nuclear structures. These findings suggest that TDG sumoylation promotes intramolecular interactions with amino- and carboxy-terminal SUMO-1 binding motifs that dramatically alter the biochemical properties and subcellular localization of TDG.","['Mohan, Ryan D', 'Rao, Anita', 'Gagliardi, Jason', 'Tini, Marc']","['Mohan RD', 'Rao A', 'Gagliardi J', 'Tini M']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Siebens-Drake Medical Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada N6G 2V4.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (Thymine DNA Glycosylase)']",IM,"['Allosteric Site', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*physiology', 'Thymine DNA Glycosylase/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2006/10/25 09:00,2007/01/19 09:00,['2006/10/25 09:00'],"['2006/10/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00323-06 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00323-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Jan;27(1):229-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00323-06.

In attempting to establish a murine model of human KIT(D816V) (hKIT(D816V))-mediated leukemia, we uncovered an unexpected relationship between cellular transformation and intracellular trafficking. We found that transport of hKIT(D816V) protein was blocked at the endoplasmic reticulum in a species-specific fashion. We exploited these species-specific trafficking differences and a set of localization domain-tagged KIT mutants to explore the relationship between subcellular localization of mutant KIT and cellular transformation. The protein products of fully transforming KIT mutants localized to the Golgi apparatus and to a lesser extent the plasma membrane. Domain-tagged KIT(D816V) targeted to the Golgi apparatus remained constitutively active and transforming. Chemical inhibition of intracellular transport demonstrated that Golgi localization is sufficient, but plasma membrane localization is dispensable, for downstream signaling mediated by KIT mutation. When expressed in murine bone marrow, endoplasmic reticulum-localized hKIT(D816V) failed to induce disease in mice, while expression of either Golgi-localized HyKIT(D816V) or cytosol-localized, ectodomain-deleted KIT(D816V) uniformly caused fatal myeloproliferative diseases.

Some researches showed that either acute or chronic GVHD is often accompanied by graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, and this positive effect is associated with the decrease of leukemia relapse and the prolongation of disease-free survival of recipients. This study was to assess the influence of GVHD on the outcome of allo-HSCT. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with hematologic malignancies received allo-HSCT from Mar. 1995 to Oct. 2005. The occurrence of GVHD, relapse of leukemia, and survival of recipients were analyzed retrospectively, and the correlations of GVHD to leukemia relapse and patients' survival were evaluated. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 20 months (range 2-127 months) after transplantation, 20 (76.9%) patients developed GVHD, 1 of which had tumor relapsed; 3 of the 6 patients without GVHD had tumor relapsed. The relapse rate was significantly lower in the recipients with GVHD than in the recipients without GVHD (P<0.05). After transplantation, 16 patients survived disease-freely, and 10 died. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the 3-year disease-freely survival rate was 60%. The disease-freely survival rate was significantly higher in the recipients with GVHD than in the recipients without GVHD (15/20 vs. 1/6, log-rank=7.30, P<0.05). Cox regression models showed a significantly decreased risk of death in the recipients with GVHD (risk ratio=0.2, P<0.05). Of the 20 recipients with GVHD, 17 achieved complete response (CR), 15 of whom survived disease-freely; no survived in the 3 patients who did not achieve CR. The disease-freely survival rate was significantly higher in the recipients achieved CR than in the recipients did not (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GVHD is an important factor that may influence the outcome of allo-HSCT. Treatment efficacy of GVHD is significantly associated with the disease-free survival of recipients.

Our previous study showed a co-expression of RAG1 and RAG2 in a human T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat, which represents a mature stage of T cell development, and that the mRNA levels could be regulated by T cell activators. This study was to determine RAGs-mediated T cell receptor(TCR) gene recombination in Jurkat cells, and thus to provide a new thoughtway for studying the correlations of TCR gene recombination to lymphoid malignancy. METHODS: TCR Dbeta-Jbeta signal joint T-cell receptor excision DNA circles (sjTRECs) were determined by nested and semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Double-strand DNA breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in the TCR beta chain locus were detected by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR).

Among the 58 evaluated patients, 45 (77.5%) showed clonal karyotypic abnormalities and the percentages of the abnormal cells were recorded within the range of 30%-100%. Some 14 were classified as M1, 20 as M2, 19 as M3 , 3 as M4, 1 as M5 and 1 as M6. The most common chromosome rearrangements were t(15;17), t( 8;21) and t(9;22). Trisomy of chromosome 8 (+8) was the most frequent numerical alteration in 3 patients with M1, M2 and M6. The incidence of other chromosomal defects, including -10, DMCs , -19 , 5q- , dicentric(dic), chromatid breaks, and marker chromosomes was relatively high. Similarities and dissimilarities of our study with others may be due to the role of genetic sensitivities as well as uneven geographic distribution in the pathogenesis of ANLL.

In this work, we try to explore potential AML1-ETO-targeted proteins through comparing two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE)-based global protein expression profiles of leukemic U937 cells with and without inducible expression of AML1-ETO. As a result, we identified 14 unique proteins deregulated in AML1-ETO-carrying leukemic cells, including 3 up-regulated such as hairy and enhancer of split 5 (HES5) and 11 down-regulated such as MAT1 (menage a trois-1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase organizer 1 (MORG1).

Chronic HCV is characterized by T cells that are functionally impaired and exhibit an immature phenotype. To investigate the potential role of IL-7/IL-7Ralpha in the outcome of HCV infection, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to characterize patients with acute infection (n = 24), long-term chronic infection (12) and normal subjects (13). HCV infection per se resulted in downregulation of CD127 on total CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes as compared to normal controls. Total expression was lowest in those patients who subsequently developed persistence and intermediate in those patients with acute-resolving infection. This reduction affected both naive and effector/memory T cells. CD127 correlated phenotypically with upregulation of chemokine receptors CCR7 and CXCR4, expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and enhanced IL-2 production. In six HLA A2-positive patients, we longitudinally tracked tetramer responses to HCV and CMV epitopes; at baseline, reflecting the expression of CD127 on whole T cell populations, viral-specific CTLs in patients who became chronic demonstrated lower CD127. In conclusion, CD127 is a useful marker of functional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and its expression correlates with virologic outcome of acute HCV. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the observation that CTLs generated in early infection rapidly decline as chronicity is established; CD127 expression should be considered in the design of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.","['Golden-Mason, Lucy', 'Burton, James R Jr', 'Castelblanco, Nicole', 'Klarquist, Jared', 'Benlloch, Salvador', 'Wang, Chia', 'Rosen, Hugo R']","['Golden-Mason L', 'Burton JR Jr', 'Castelblanco N', 'Klarquist J', 'Benlloch S', 'Wang C', 'Rosen HR']","['Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Hepatitis C Center, and Integrated Program in Immunology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center & National Jewish Hospital, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hepacivirus/immunology', 'Hepatitis C/*immunology', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/immunology/*metabolism']",2006/10/24 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.21365 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2006 Nov;44(5):1098-109. doi: 10.1002/hep.21365.,,,['R01 DK060590/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have been published on bone mineral density (BMD) evaluation in children surviving from brain tumours. The endocrine system in these patients is frequently affected as consequence of therapeutic interventions such as cranial irradiation and anti-neoplastic agents: growth hormone deficiency is the most common adverse sequel. The pathogenesis of osteopenia in brain cancer survivors is multi-factorial but still uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine bone mass in 12 brain cancer survivors and its relationship with their hormonal status. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We observed that most of the patients had a BMD that was lower than normal in both the lumbar column and in the femoral neck. Bone mass loss was higher in the lumbar region rather than in the femoral neck, due to spinal radiation therapy and to the effect of hormonal deficiencies. Particularly hypogonadism, but also multiple hormonal deficiencies, are associated with lower BMD values. Experience in clinical care of these patients suggests the importance of periodic evaluations of BMD, especially in those with secondary hormone deficiencies. Moreover, the periodic assessment of the hypothalamus-pituitary function is essential for an early diagnosis of hormonal insufficiency, primarily hypogonadism, to precociously detect bone mineral loss and to prevent pathological fractures, thus improving the quality of life.","['Petraroli, M', ""D'Alessio, E"", 'Ausili, E', 'Barini, A', 'Caradonna, P', 'Riccardi, R', 'Caldarelli, M', 'Rossodivita, A']","['Petraroli M', ""D'Alessio E"", 'Ausili E', 'Barini A', 'Caradonna P', 'Riccardi R', 'Caldarelli M', 'Rossodivita A']","['Department of Paediatrics, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Density/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypogonadism/etiology', 'Male', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', '*Survivors']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00381-006-0175-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2007 Jan;23(1):59-65. doi: 10.1007/s00381-006-0175-7.

Our previous investigations demonstrated that the BCL2 major breakpoint region (mbr) in the 3'-UTR upregulates reporter gene expression, which implies that this region possessed intrinsic regulatory function. However, the effect of the mbr on BCL2 expression, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms, remain to be elucidated. To assess the direct effect of the mbr on the transcriptional activity of the BCL2 gene, we employed targeted homologous recombination to establish a mbr(+)/mbr(-) heterozygous Nalm-6 cell line and then compared the transcriptional activity and apoptotic effect on transcription between the wild type and targeted alleles. We found that deletion of the mbr significantly decreased the transcriptional activity of the corresponding allele in the mbr(+)/mbr(-) cell. The BCL2 allele deleted of the mbr had a slower response to apoptotic stimuli than did the wild type allele. The regulatory function of the mbr was mediated through SATB1. Overexpression of SATB1 increased BCL2 expression, while knockdown of SATB1 with RNAi decreased BCL2 expression. Our results clearly indicated that the mbr could positively regulate BCL2 gene expression and this regulatory function was closely related to SATB1.","['Ma, C', 'Zhang, J', 'Durrin, L K', 'Lv, J', 'Zhu, D', 'Han, X', 'Sun, Y']","['Ma C', 'Zhang J', 'Durrin LK', 'Lv J', 'Zhu D', 'Han X', 'Sun Y']","['Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SATB1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosome Breakage', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210069 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210069 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Apr 19;26(18):2649-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210069.

There were 68 episodes of VRE BSI in 60 patients with acute (53%) or chronic (8%) leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (22%) or other malignant hematologic disorders (17%). A total of 13, 32 and 32% were recipients of autologous, related and matched-unrelated transplants, respectively. Forty-two of allograft recipients had active acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 32% chronic GVHD. Only 57% were neutropenic, 52% had refractory/relapsed malignancy and 60% had end organ dysfunction with a median APACHE II score of 17. Median survival after VRE BSI was 19 days. Pneumonia, receipt of anti-fungal drugs and low APACHE II score at the time of the VRE BSI remained significant risk factors for death on multivariable analysis.

METHODS: Active and passive DF-ROM were measured throughout a two-year treatment period and one year after treatment in 40 subjects. Children without health problems and historical controls who had not received therapeutic input were used for comparison. RESULTS: Active DF-ROM showed an average tendency to decline significantly during treatment, whereas passive DF-ROM did not. Both increased significantly following the end of treatment. There were substantial individual differences around these patterns of average change. Gender (female) was a predictor of negative change in DF-ROM during treatment. Average DF-ROM one year after treatment was significantly greater than for the historical controls and not significantly different from the healthy controls. None of the children required surgical intervention, in contrast to the historical controls. CONCLUSIONS: Education and intervention appears to have improved DF-ROM outcome in children treated for leukemia.","['Wright, Marilyn J', 'Hanna, Steven E', 'Halton, Jacqueline M', 'Barr, Ronald D']","['Wright MJ', 'Hanna SE', 'Halton JM', 'Barr RD']","[""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Phys Ther,Pediatric physical therapy : the official publication of the Section on Pediatrics of the American Physical Therapy Association,8912748,,,,2006/10/24 09:00,2006/10/24 09:01,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/24 09:01 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.PEP.0000083122.74062.1B [doi]', '00001577-200301530-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Phys Ther. 2003 Fall;15(3):146-52. doi: 10.1097/01.PEP.0000083122.74062.1B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate a novel role for these proteins in the transcriptional control of a BH3-only gene. PAR bZIP proteins are able to transactivate the promoter of bcl-gS. This promoter is particularly responsive to TEF activation and is silenced by NFIL3, a repressor that shares the consensus binding site with PAR bZIP proteins. Consistently, transfection of TEF induces the expression of endogenous bcl-gS in cancer cells, and this induction is independent of p53. A naturally occurring variant of DBP (tDBP), lacking the transactivation domain, has been identified and shown to impede the formation of active TEF dimers in a competitive manner and to reduce the TEF-dependent induction of bcl-gS. Of note, treatment of cancer cells with etoposide induces TEF activation and promotes the expression of bcl-gS. Furthermore, blockade of bcl-gS or TEF expression by a small interfering RNA strategy or transfection with tDBP significantly reduces the etoposide-mediated apoptotic cell death. These findings represent the first described role for PAR bZIP proteins in the regulation of a gene involved in the execution of apoptosis.","['Benito, Adalberto', 'Gutierrez, Olga', 'Pipaon, Carlos', 'Real, Pedro J', 'Gachon, Frederic', 'Ritchie, Alistair E', 'Fernandez-Luna, Jose L']","['Benito A', 'Gutierrez O', 'Pipaon C', 'Real PJ', 'Gachon F', 'Ritchie AE', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Unidad de Genetica Molecular, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Servicio Cantabro de Salud, 39008 Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/*physiology', 'Proline/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)71823-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M607004200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 15;281(50):38351-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M607004200.

The pancreas has three distinct cell types, ductal, acinar, and islet, each with different functions. Embryologically, the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) homeodomain protein is critical for the initiation of all pancreatic lineages; however, the later differentiation of the endocrine pancreas is uniquely dependent upon high PDX1 expression, whereas PDX1 is down-regulated in the ductal and acinar cell lineages. We find that this down-regulation may be required for normal ductal expression of cytokeratin K19. The K19 promoter-reporter gene assay demonstrates that ectopic PDX1 inhibits K19 reporter gene activity in primary pancreatic ductal cells. This is reinforced by our findings that retrovirally mediated stable transduction of PDX1 in primary pancreatic ductal cells suppresses K19 expression, and short interfering RNA to PDX1 in Min6 insulinoma cells results in the induction of normally undetectable K19. Complementary functional and biochemical approaches led to the unexpected finding that a multimeric complex of PDX1 and two members of the TALE homeodomain factor family, MEIS1a and PBX1b, regulates K19 gene transcription through a specific cis-regulatory element (-341 to -325) upstream of the K19 transcription start site. These data suggest a unifying mechanism whereby PDX1, myeloid ecotropic viral insertion site (MEIS), and pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX) may regulate ductal and acinar lineage specification during pancreatic development. Specifically, concomitant PDX1 suppression and MEIS isoform expression result in proper ductal and acinar lineage specification. Furthermore, PDX1 may inhibit the ductal differentiation program in the pancreatic endocrine compartment, particularly beta cells.","['Deramaudt, Therese B', 'Sachdeva, Mira M', 'Wescott, Melanie P', 'Chen, Yuting', 'Stoffers, Doris A', 'Rustgi, Anil K']","['Deramaudt TB', 'Sachdeva MM', 'Wescott MP', 'Chen Y', 'Stoffers DA', 'Rustgi AK']","['Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, 415 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Keratin-19)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Insulinoma/genetics/pathology', 'Keratin-19/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Pancreas/cytology/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)71827-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M605891200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 15;281(50):38385-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M605891200.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this variable sensitivity of leukemic blasts to azanucleosides such as 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) may involve modifier effects of specific fusion proteins such as AML1/ETO. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15/INK4b is one potential target of DNA demethylating activity in AML and MDS where it is frequently silenced by hypermethylation. To study sensitivity to DAC in myeloid leukemia cells, we chose the myeloid cell lines Kasumi-1 (expressing AML1/ETO), KG-1 and KG-1a (both AML1/ETO-negative) all of which a highly methylated p15/INK4b gene. Treatment with DAC resulted in dose-dependent regional demethylation of p15/INK4b in Kasumi-1 and KG-1, but only to a modest degree in KG-1a cells. Demethylation was associated with induction of p15/INK4b protein expression. Growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic activity of DAC was significantly higher in Kasumi-1 than in KG-1a cells, and sensitization of cells to a cooperating effect of All-trans retinoic acid and of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A was observed. DAC-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis were enhanced when AML1/ETO was conditionally expressed in AML1/ETO-negative U-937 cells. In conclusion, hypomethylation and reactivation of p15/INK4b in myeloid cell lines are among the molecular events associated with DAC-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Further studies of AML1/ETO as a modifier of the epigenotype and sensitivity of myeloid cells to inhibitors of DNMTs and HDACs appear warranted.","['Berg, Tobias', 'Guo, Yalin', 'Abdelkarim, Mahmoud', 'Fliegauf, Manfred', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Berg T', 'Guo Y', 'Abdelkarim M', 'Fliegauf M', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Hugstetter Str. 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00312-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Apr;31(4):497-506. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.08.008.

In the late 19th century Vaquez provided the first description of polycythemia vera (PV) and Hueck defined idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF). In 1920, di Guglielmo established criteria for patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). In 1951, Dameshek argued that these disorders, along with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) display many similar clinical and laboratory features [Dameshek W. Some speculations on the myeloproliferative syndromes. Blood 1951;6:372-5], and grouped them. In 2002, the World Health Organization expanded the definition of CMDs to also include chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), chronic eosinophilic leukemia/hypereosinophilic syndrome (CEL/HES) and systemic mast cell disorder (SMCD) [Vardiman JW, Harris NL, Brunning RD. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of the myeloid neoplasms. Blood 2002;100:2292-302]. While the molecular pathogenesis of CML is well known [Melo JV, Deininger MW.

Each of these disorders is characterized by excessive hematopoiesis, a process usually dependent on one or more hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs). This review will focus on how our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which HGFs are produced, bind cell surface receptors and transduce survival and proliferative signals have provided the platform on which the multiple origins of CMDs can be understood and novel therapeutic interventions designed.","['Kaushansky, Kenneth']",['Kaushansky K'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, 402 Dickinson Street, Suite 380, San Diego, CA 92103-8811, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,Cytokine & growth factor reviews,9612306,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/02/01 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1359-6101(06)00054-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cytogfr.2006.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006 Dec;17(6):423-30. doi: 10.1016/j.cytogfr.2006.09.005.

The objective of this work was to study the CD26 membrane expression and DPPIV activity in T-acute leukaemia cell lines (CEM and MOLT3) in culture, in order to observe the modification of its expression under the 8-azaguanine treatment. Cell line samples were incubated, some without different azaguanine concentration and others with, ranging from 10 to 100muM. Cell surface CD26 expression has been identified by flow cytometry and DPPIV activity, in cultured medium, was fluorimetrically measured. Results we have observed showed that 8-azaguanine induced a decrease in cell viability in a dose, time and cell type dependent manner with MOLT3 cells being the most sensitive to 8-azaguanine citotoxic effects (24h IC50: +/-10muM) when compared with CEM cells (24h IC50: +/-100muM). In the same experimental conditions, MOLT3 cell treated with 8-azaguanine shows an increase in CD26 expression (MIF) compared with that of CEM cell submitted to the same conditions (65.4+/-1.3 versus 18.7+/-1.7). DPPIV activity in culture medium supernatant of CEM versus MOLT3 controls cells (1.91+/-0.43 versus 2.06+/-0.50) and of CEM versus MOLT3 treated cells (2.10+/-0.16 versus 1.89+/-0.04) did not show a significant difference.

These are hallmarks of autophagy. Autophagic vacuoles develop rapidly, preceding the appearance of an apoptotic nuclear morphology and can be observed in both non-apoptotic and apoptotic cells. Inhibition of autophagy by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin promoted apoptosis; conversely inhibition of caspase-3/7 with zDEVD-fmk promoted autophagy.

Here, we studied the role of the CNTF/LIF signaling pathway during mouse retinal development in vivo. We show that exposure to CNTF during neonatal retinal development in vivo retards rhodopsin expression and results in an important and specific deficit in photoreceptor cells. Detailed analysis revealed that exposure to CNTF during retinal development causes a sharp increase in cell death of postmitotic rod precursor cells. Importantly, we show that blocking the CNTF/LIF signaling pathway during mouse retinal development in vivo results in a significant reduction of naturally occurring cell death. Using retroviral lineage analysis, we demonstrate that exposure to CNTF causes a specific reduction of clones containing only rods without affecting other clone types, whereas blocking the CNTF/LIF receptor complex causes a specific increase of clones containing only rods. In addition, we show that stimulation of the CNTF/LIF pathway positively regulates the expression of the neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) genes, and blocking nitric oxide production by pre-treatment with a NOS inhibitor abolishes CNTF-induced cell death.

METHODS: Sixty-one children with AML, 37 male and 24 female, aged 96 months (6 - 154 months), underwent treatment according to the protocol AML-XH-99 with a total treatment course of 15 months and were followed up for 12 months (1 - 74 months). Bone marrow smear was made 48 hours after the end of the first course of induction treatment. Then the children were divided into 2 groups according to the number of bone marrow blast cells: group with the number of blast cells > or = 0.15 and group with the number of blast cells < 0.15. Second bone marrow smear was made when complete remission was achieved after the end of the treatment course. Then the children were divided into 2 groups according to the number of bone marrow blast cells: group with the number of blast cells of 0.00 and group with the number of blast cells between 0.00 and 0.05. The probability of event-free survival (EFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Log-rank test was used to compare the 5-year EFS (pEFS) of different groups. The differences in the biological features were compared by Chi-square analysis or Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The pEFS of the group with the number of blast cells > or = 0.15 was 18% +/- 15%, significantly shorter than that of the group with the number of blast cells < 0.15 (49% +/- 11%, P = 0.079). The 3 patients without morphologically identifiable blast all survived 5 years after complete remission had been achieved, and the pEFS of the 39 patients with the number of blast cells between 0.00 and 0.05 was 53% +/- 10%. The pEFS of the patients among which complete remission was achieved after the first course of treatment (n = 39) was 54% +/- 10%, significantly higher than that of the patients without complete remission after the first course of treatment (10% +/- 9%, P = 0.0002). Multiple factor analysis showed that achievement of complete remission after the first course of treatment and existence of central nervous system leukemia were both independent prognostic factors with the hazard ratios of 4.007 and 7.050 respectively and the 95% confidential intervals of 1.019 to 6.163 and 0.018 to 0.547 respectively (P = 0.045 and P = 0.008). The number of blasts 48 hours after the end of the first course of induction treatment was highly correlated with the rate of complete remission after the first treatment course (P = 0.000 028 8). CONCLUSION: With important prognostic significance, early treatment response, such as the number of blasts 48 hours after the end of the first course of induction treatment can predict whether complete remission can be achieved.","['Tie, Li-Jun', 'Gu, Long-jun', 'Song, De-lian', 'Xue, Hui-liang', 'Tang, Jing-yan', 'Dong, Lu', 'Pan, Ci', 'Chen, Jing', 'Ye, Hui', 'Chen, Jing', 'Wang, Yao-ping', 'Zou, Jia-yin']","['Tie LJ', 'Gu LJ', 'Song DL', 'Xue HL', 'Tang JY', 'Dong L', 'Pan C', 'Chen J', 'Ye H', 'Chen J', 'Wang YP', 'Zou JY']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Affiliated Shanghai Children's Medical Center of Medical College of Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/07/20 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Jul 11;86(26):1837-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have focused on polymorphisms in the 5' promoter region and first exon of NOTCH4. Our aim was to test the association of the entire genomic region of NOTCH4 in 218 families with at least two siblings affected by schizophrenia in Taiwan. We genotyped seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of this gene, with average intermarker distances of 5.3 kb. Intermarker linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated using gold software, and single-locus and haplotype association analyses were performed using transmit software. We found that the T allele of SNP rs2071285 (P= 0.035) and the G allele of SNP rs204993 (P= 0.0097) were significantly preferentially transmitted to the affected individuals in the single-locus association analysis. The two SNPs were in high LD (D' > 0.8). Trend for overtransmission was shown for the T-G haplotype of the two SNPs to affected individuals (P= 0.053), with the A-A haplotype significantly undertransmitted (P= 0.034). The associated region distributed across the distal portion of the NOTCH4 gene and overlapped with the genomic region of the G-protein signaling modulator 3 and pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 2. In summary, we found modest association evidence between schizophrenia and the distal genomic region of NOTCH4 in this Taiwanese family sample. Further replication for association with the distal genomic region of NOTCH4 is warranted.","['Liu, C-M', 'Liu, Y-L', 'Fann, C S-J', 'Chen, W J', 'Yang, W-C', 'Ouyang, W-C', 'Chen, C-Y', 'Jou, Y-S', 'Hsieh, M-H', 'Liu, S-K', 'Hwang, T-J', 'Faraone, S V', 'Tsuang, M T', 'Hwu, H-G']","['Liu CM', 'Liu YL', 'Fann CS', 'Chen WJ', 'Yang WC', 'Ouyang WC', 'Chen CY', 'Jou YS', 'Hsieh MH', 'Liu SK', 'Hwang TJ', 'Faraone SV', 'Tsuang MT', 'Hwu HG']","['Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Brain Behav,"Genes, brain, and behavior",101129617,"['0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)']",IM,"['Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Pedigree', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch2/*genetics', 'Schizophrenia/ethnology/*genetics', 'Taiwan']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['GBB276 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1601-183X.2006.00276.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Brain Behav. 2007 Aug;6(6):497-502. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-183X.2006.00276.x.

Because survival rates have improved markedly, the long-term complications, such as GH deficiency (GHD) and neuropsychological impairment, have become increasingly important. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: The level of self-reported quality of life and neuropsychological functioning was investigated in 44 adults (21 women) with a median age of 25 years who had been treated for childhood onset (CO) ALL with CRT (median 24 Gy). Comparison was made with matched population controls. A subset of patients with GHD was evaluated for neuropsychological functioning after 1 year of GH treatment. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the patients had significantly lower performance in neuropsychological tests. Early age at treatment had a significant negative impact on neuropsychological performance in adulthood. No relationship was found between dose of CRT, time since treatment of ALL or gender and neuropsychological performance. Compared to controls, the patients did not show a poor quality of life or a lowered availability of social interactions or social networks; however, significantly more patients were living alone or with their parents. After GH testing, the patients were all considered GH deficient or insufficient, but no relationship was observed between stimulated peak GH secretion and neuropsychological performance. Treatment with GH for 1 year in a subgroup of the patients did not improve their neuropsychological performance. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that adults treated with CRT for CO ALL had GHD and significantly impaired neuropsychological performance, although self-reported quality of life was not affected. The effect of GH treatment in this patient group has to be further elucidated.","['Link, Katarina', 'Moell, Christian', 'Osterberg, Kai', 'Persson, Roger', 'Orbaek, Palle', 'Garwicz, Stanislaw', 'Cavallin-Stahl, Eva', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Link K', 'Moell C', 'Osterberg K', 'Persson R', 'Orbaek P', 'Garwicz S', 'Cavallin-Stahl E', 'Erfurth EM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Male', 'Marriage', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*psychology/*radiotherapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Social Class', 'Social Environment', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/06/19 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEN2637 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2265.2006.02637.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2006 Nov;65(5):617-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2006.02637.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study characterised the effects of the combined administration of D1 with PD98059, SB203580 or SP600125, specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 or Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), respectively. Among these inhibitors, SP600125 was the only one to markedly induce apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation. These experiments showed that SP600125 activated caspase 8 and confirmed that D1 activated the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, as caspase 8 was not affected while Bcl-2 was down-regulated following D1 administration. The combination of the two drugs enhanced caspase-8 activation and induced apoptosis in an additive fashion. JNK was constitutively activated in the Kasumi 1, NB4, HL60 and THP-1 human AML cell lines, as well as in primary blasts from a t(8;21) AML patient. In all these cells, the pro-apoptotic effect of the two drugs alone was increased when they were combined. On this basis, the combined administration of D1 with SP600125 seems to be very promising as a potential anti-leukaemic tool in AML.","['Rovida, Elisabetta', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Barbetti, Valentina', 'Giuntoli, Serena', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Dello Sbarba, Persio']","['Rovida E', 'Gozzini A', 'Barbetti V', 'Giuntoli S', 'Santini V', 'Dello Sbarba P']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (O-n-butanoyl-2,3-O-isopropylidenemannofuranoside)', '0 (Pyridines)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Butyrates/*therapeutic use', 'Caspase 8/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flavonoids/therapeutic use', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mannose/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/10/24 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/10/24 09:00'],"['2006/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6365 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06365.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Dec;135(5):653-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06365.x.

In an effort to prevent this cardiotoxicity, different anthracycline dosage schedules (i.e. peak doses and infusion durations) have been studied. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the occurrence of cardiotoxicity with the use of different anthracycline dosage schedules in cancer patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the databases of The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2004). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trials databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which different anthracycline dosage schedules were compared in cancer patients (children and adults). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed the study selection, quality assessment and data-extraction including adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We identified six RCTs of varying quality addressing different anthracycline infusion durations (625 patients). The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of 6 hours or longer as compared to a shorter infusion duration, i.e. maximal duration of 1 hour (RR = 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.81; 5 studies; 557 patients). In individual studies the infusion duration of 6 hours or longer also seemed to reduce the risk of subclinical cardiac damage. No statistically significant difference in response rate was found (RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.54; 2 studies; 292 patients). No statistically significant difference in overall survival was found (HR = 1,42; 95% CI 0.61 to 3.30; 2 studies; 322 patients), but there was unexplained heterogeneity (I(2)=75%). No conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects. It should be emphasised that the majority of patients included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. Children with leukaemia could not be included in the performed meta-analyses, but they were included in the descriptive results of non-pooled studies. No RCTs addressing different anthracycline peak doses with the same cumulative anthracycline dose in both treatment groups were identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: An anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure, and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical cardiac damage. There is no evidence which suggests a difference in response rate and survival between both treatment groups. Since there is only a small amount of data for children and also because data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different anthracycline infusion durations should be evaluated further in children. For different anthracycline peak doses no high quality evidence was available and therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with different anthracycline peak doses.","['van Dalen, E C', 'van der Pal, H J H', 'Caron, H N', 'Kremer, L C M']","['van Dalen EC', 'van der Pal HJ', 'Caron HN', 'Kremer LC']","[""Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Pediatrics, Meibergdreef 9, PO Box 22660, 1100 DD Amsterdam, Netherlands.

In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trials databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which different anthracycline derivates were compared in cancer patients (children and adults). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed the study selection, quality assessment and data-extraction including adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We identified five RCTs of varying quality addressing epirubicin versus doxorubicin (1036 patients) with the same dose. The meta-analysis showed no evidence for a significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure between the treatment groups (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.11). However, there is some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin. We identified two RCTs with varying quality addressing liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin (521 patients). The meta-analysis showed a significantly lower rate of both clinical heart failure and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75 and RR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59 respectively). It should be noted that in one of the studies patients in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose than patients in the doxorubicin group. For the other possible combinations of different anthracycline derivates only one RCT was identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given with the same dose. Based on the currently available evidence on heart failure, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. For both epirubicin versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia. More research is needed. For other combinations of anthracycline derivates not enough evidence was available to make definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines.","['van Dalen, E C', 'Michiels, E M C', 'Caron, H N', 'Kremer, L C M']","['van Dalen EC', 'Michiels EM', 'Caron HN', 'Kremer LC']","[""Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Pediatrics, Meibergdreef 9, PO Box 22660, 1100 DD Amsterdam, Netherlands.

METHODS: One hundred twenty patients were randomized to receive high-dose fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC-HD) (fluorouracil 750 mg/m(2) on Days 1 to 4, epirubicin 35 mg/m(2) on Days 2 to 4, and cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m(2) on Days 2 to 4 for 4 cycles every 21 days) with or without lenograstim. Locoregional treatment consisted of surgery and/or radiotherapy. Maintenance chemotherapy was FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles). No hormone treatment was allowed. RESULTS: The safety of the FEC-HD regimen was described previously. Among 102 patients who underwent surgery, a pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved by 23.5% of patients with breast tumors and by 31.4% of patients with involved axillary lymph nodes. The overall pCR rate was 14.7%. One hundred nine patients received FEC 75. After a median 10 years of follow-up, the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 35.7% and 41.2%, respectively. The median DFS was 39 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 25-53 months), and the median survival was 61 months (95% CI, 43-79 months). Five patients developed a temporary decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction without congestive heart failure. In the lenograstim group, 1 patient developed acute myeloblastic leukemia M2, and 1 patient developed myelodysplastic syndrome.

In this retrospective study, the authors evaluated the benefit of alemtuzumab monotherapy in unselected patients with advanced, previously treated CLL who received treatment in the routine clinical setting. METHODS: Data were collected from 115 consecutive patients who received alemtuzumab therapy at 25 participating centers in Austria. Patients received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-11 prior lines of therapy), and 59% had fludarabine-refractory disease. Alemtuzumab was administered intravenously or subcutaneously with a planned schedule of 30 mg 3 times per week for up to 12 weeks. Patients received valacyclovir and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for antiinfective prophylaxis. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 23%, with complete responses achieved in 5% of patients. Stable disease (SD) was achieved in 36% of patients. After a median follow-up of 17.5 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 20.2 months for all patients. A multivariate Cox regression analysis that included pretreatment baseline characteristics, response to therapy, and cumulative dose of alemtuzumab indicated that bulky lymphadenopathy, the administration of > r =3 previous therapies, and lack of response to alemtuzumab remained significant independent risk factors for inferior OS. The median OS had not been reached for responding patients. The median OS was 29.5 months for patients with SD and 10.8 months for patients with progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: The broad use of alemtuzumab in the routine clinical practice setting is feasible and active in unselected patients with pretreated CLL, and the current results confirmed the activity and safety of this agent, as reported in previously published clinical studies.","['Fiegl, Michael', 'Falkner, Andreas', 'Hopfinger, Georg', 'Brugger, Stefan', 'Zabernigg, August', 'Bauer, Franz', 'Haslbauer, Ferdinand', 'Demirtas, Dita', 'Grossschmidt, Peter', 'Tatzreiter, Georg', 'Gastl, Gunther', 'Greil, Richard']","['Fiegl M', 'Falkner A', 'Hopfinger G', 'Brugger S', 'Zabernigg A', 'Bauer F', 'Haslbauer F', 'Demirtas D', 'Grossschmidt P', 'Tatzreiter G', 'Gastl G', 'Greil R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. michael.fiegl@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Austria', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/10/21 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/10/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22263 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Nov 15;107(10):2408-16. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22263.,,,,,,,,,['Austrian Collaborative Study Group on Alemtuzumab in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia'],,,,,,,,,,,

The present report describes the effects of dietary Mekabu fucoidan on the tumor growth of mouse A20 leukemia cells and on T cell-mediated immune responses in T cell receptor transgenic (DO-11 - 10 - Tg) mice. The animals were fed with a diet containing 1% Mekabu fucoidan (0.034 +/- 0.003 g/mouse/day) for 10 days and subcutaneously (s. c.) inoculated with A20 leukemia cells. Thereafter, the mice were fed with the diet containing fucoidan for 40 days. Mekabu fucoidan inhibited tumors by 65.4 %. We studied how the killer activities of T cell-mediated and natural killer (NK) cells are augmented in DO-11 - 10 mice fed with Mekabu fucoidan. The cytolytic activities of ovalbumin (OVA), which is specific against OVA-transfected A20 (OVA-A20) B lymphoma cells, and NK cells against YAC-1 were significantly enhanced in the mice fed with fucoidan compared with a basic diet. Thus, these findings suggested that Mekabu fucoidan mediates tumor destruction through Th1 cell and NK cell responses.","['Maruyama, Hiroko', 'Tamauchi, Hidekazu', 'Iizuka, Mariko', 'Nakano, Takahisa']","['Maruyama H', 'Tamauchi H', 'Iizuka M', 'Nakano T']","['Department of Pathology, School of Allied Health Sciences, Kitasato University, Kitasato Kanagawa, Japan. maruyama@ahs.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/immunology', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', '*Phytotherapy', 'Polysaccharides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', '*Undaria']",2006/10/21 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/10/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2006-951703 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2006 Dec;72(15):1415-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-951703.

In several cancer cells, MDR is thought to be mediated by the super-expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp extrudes drugs from the cells, therefore reducing their cytotoxicity, and its activity inhibition may reverse the MDR phenotype. The present study evaluated the possible cytotoxic effect and MDR reversing properties of the extract and compounds isolated from Phyllanthus amarus. To this purpose, two human leukaemia cell lines were employed: K-562 and its vincristine-resistant counterpart Lucena-1, a Pgp-overexpressing subline. We report here that Lucena-1 was significantly more resistant to the cytotoxicity of P. amarus derivatives: the hexane extract (HE, 100 microg/mL), the lignans-rich fraction (LRF, 100 microg/mL) and the lignans nirtetralin (NIRT, 43.2 microg/mL), niranthin (NIRA, 43 microg/mL) or phyllanthin (PHYLLA, 43 microg/mL) exerted cytotoxic effects on K-562 cells with 40.3, 66.0, 62.0, 61.0 or 24.1% of cell death, respectively. The cellular toxicity observed on Lucena-1 was 16.3, 40.4, 29.4, 30.2, or 24.8%, respectively. However, cell treatment with the lignan phyltetralin (PHYLT) up to 41.6 microg/mL had no cytotoxic action on either of the cell lines. P. amarus derivatives were also found to be effective in inhibiting Pgp activity as assessed by rhodamine accumulation in Lucena-1 cells, as were the classical Pgp inhibitors, cyclosporine A (160 nM), PSC-833 (2 microM) and verapamil (5 microM). The lignan NIRT produced the most potent inhibition (EC (50) = 29.4 microg/mL) followed by NIRA (44.3 microg/mL), LRF (49.1 microg/mL), PHYLT (99.4 microg/mL), PHYLLA and HE (> 100 microg/mL). Lucena-1 cells were more resistant to daunorubicin-induced cell death (LC (50) = 50 microM) than K562 cells (LC (50) = 4.95 microM). Of note, the P. amarus derivatives significantly potentiated 5 microM daunorubicin-induced cell death in Lucena-1 cells (P < 0.01) but not in K562 cells. After treatment only with P. amarus derivatives (100 microg/mL HE, 30 microg/mL LRF, 12.9 microg/mL NIRA, 43.2 microg/mL NIRT, 43 microg/mL PHYLLA or 41.6 microg/mL PHYLT), the Lucena-1 cellular viability was 83.7, 85.3, 101, 69.7, 75.6 or 88.7%, respectively, whereas the in the presence of daunorubincin, which was not cytotoxic PER SE, the cell viability decreased to 42.9, 42.2, 64.2, 35.4, 30.4 or 52.6%, respectively. Together, these results suggest a potential action of P. amarus derivatives as MDR reversing agents, mainly due to their ability to synergize with the action of conventional chemotherapeutics.","['Leite, Daniela F', 'Kassuya, Candida A', 'Mazzuco, Tania L', 'Silvestre, Aline', 'de Melo, Lucilia V', 'Rehder, Vera L', 'Rumjanek, Vivian M', 'Calixto, Joao B']","['Leite DF', 'Kassuya CA', 'Mazzuco TL', 'Silvestre A', 'de Melo LV', 'Rehder VL', 'Rumjanek VM', 'Calixto JB']","['Instituto de Bioquimica Medica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Lignans/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Phyllanthus', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Vincristine']",2006/10/21 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/10/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2006-951708 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2006 Dec;72(15):1353-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-951708.

The diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was based on cytological, histological, immunophenotypic, and molecular biology methods. The mean fluorescence intensity of the adhesion molecules in tumor cells was measured by flow cytometry of CD19-positive cells and differed amongst the types of lymphomas. Comparison of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle-cell lymphoma showed that the former presented a higher expression of CD11c and CD49c, and a lower expression of CD11b and CD49d adhesion molecules. Comparison of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marginal B-cell lymphoma showed that the former presented a higher expression of CD49c and a lower expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD49d, CD29, and CD54. Finally, comparison of mantle-cell lymphoma and marginal B-cell lymphoma showed that marginal B-cell lymphoma had a higher expression of CD11a, CD11c, CD18, CD29, and CD54. Thus, the CD49c/CD49d pair consistently demonstrated a distinct pattern of expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared with mantle-cell lymphoma and marginal B-cell lymphoma, which could be helpful for the differential diagnosis.

We describe a case of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) after institution of treatment with imatinib. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 78-year-old woman was treated with low-dose imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia since November 2003. A macular and pruritic eruption appeared on the patient's trunk after 7 weeks of treatment and gradually worsened. After 1 month, she was admitted for generalized skin eruption with fever and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Laboratory data showed hypereosinophilia and blood cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Imatinib was stopped and replaced with hydroxyurea (Hydrea). Improved clinical and laboratory results were seen with antibiotics and topical steroids. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of DRESS following treatment with imatinib. Cutaneous reactions to imatinib are frequent and are usually mild, comprising maculopapular eruption, pruritus and facial edema. Few cases of serious skin reactions have been reported until now. Several authors suggest that the prevalence and severity of cutaneous manifestations are related to a pharmacologic effect of imatinib. Our observation cannot rule out an underlying immunologic mechanism. Septicemia may also play a part in the development of DRESS.","['Le Nouail, P', 'Viseux, V', 'Chaby, G', 'Billet, A', 'Denoeux, J P', 'Lok, C']","['Le Nouail P', 'Viseux V', 'Chaby G', 'Billet A', 'Denoeux JP', 'Lok C']","['Service de Dermatologie et Venereologie, Hopital Sud, Amiens, France. patricialenouail@yahoo.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/microbiology', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Eruptions/*etiology', 'Eosinophilia/*chemically induced', 'Exanthema/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pruritus/chemically induced', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Staphylococcal Infections/diagnosis', 'Syndrome']",2006/10/21 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['MDOI-AD-08-2006-133-8-0151-9638-101019-200518910 [pii]', '10.1016/s0151-9638(06)70992-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2006 Aug-Sep;133(8-9 Pt 1):686-8. doi: 10.1016/s0151-9638(06)70992-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DRESS (Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) apres traitement par imatinib (Glivec).,,,,

Previously, we demonstrated that expression of Scl/Tal1, a transcription factor required for the specification of HSCs, is controlled by Ets and GATA factors. Here we characterize the molecular mechanisms controlling expression of Lyl1, a paralog of Scl also required for HSC function. Two closely spaced promoters directed expression to hematopoietic progenitor, megakaryocytic, and endothelial cells in transgenic mice. Conserved binding sites required for promoter activity were bound in vivo by GATA-2 and the Ets factors Fli1, Elf1, Erg, and PU.1. However, despite coregulation of Scl and Lyl1 by the same Ets and GATA factors, Scl expression was initiated prior to Lyl1 in embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation assays. Moreover, ectopic expression of Scl but not Lyl1 rescued hematopoietic differentiation in Scl-/- ES cells, thus providing a molecular explanation for the vastly different phenotypes of Scl-/- and Lyl1-/- mouse embryos. Furthermore, coregulation of Scl and Lyl1 later during development may explain the mild phenotype of Scl-/- adult HSCs.","['Chan, Wan Y I', 'Follows, George A', 'Lacaud, Georges', 'Pimanda, John E', 'Landry, Josette-Renee', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Piltz, Sandie', 'Donaldson, Ian J', 'Gambardella, Laure', 'Sablitzky, Fred', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Kouskoff, Valerie', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Chan WY', 'Follows GA', 'Lacaud G', 'Pimanda JE', 'Landry JR', 'Kinston S', 'Knezevic K', 'Piltz S', 'Donaldson IJ', 'Gambardella L', 'Sablitzky F', 'Green AR', 'Kouskoff V', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/chemistry/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Embryo, Mammalian/embryology/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors']",2006/10/21 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41911-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-023226 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):1908-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-023226.

One new advance in this field is the identification of PTPN11 as the first proto-oncogene that encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase with 2 Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains (Shp2). This tyrosine phosphatase was previously shown to play an essential role in normal hematopoiesis. More recently, somatic missense PTPN11 gain-of-function mutations have been detected in leukemias and rarely in solid tumors, and have been found to induce aberrant hyperactivation of the Ras-Erk pathway.

Twenty-four large (>10 Mb) copy-neutral regions with loss of heterozygosity were identified in 14 cases. These regions with loss of heterozygosity are not detectable by alternative methods and may harbor novel imprinted genes or loss-of-function alleles that may be important for the pathogenesis of CLL.

To study the influence of constitutively elevated VEGF-A levels on the progression of erythroleukemia, mice heterozygous for a VEGF-A ""hypermorphic"" allele (Vegfhi/+) were inoculated with F-MuLV. Unexpectedly, a significant delay in erythroleukemia was observed in Vegfhi/+ mice when compared with wild-type controls. These results suggested an altered physiologic response arising from elevated VEGF-A levels that decelerated erythroleukemic progression. Characterization of hematopoiesis in Vegfhi/+ spleens showed a higher natural killer cell activity, elevated B cells, and a decrease in T-cell number. Furthermore, higher erythroid progenitors (ie, CD34+, CD36+, and Ter119+ cells) were evident in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood of Vegfhi/+ mice. The CFU-E levels were significantly elevated in Vegfhi/+ bone marrow cultures, and this elevation was blocked by a neutralizing antibody to VEGF-A receptor (VEGFR-2). Moreover, erythroleukemic mice were treated with recombinant erythropoietin and, similar to diseased Vegfhi/+ mice, showed a delay in disease progression.

A population-based analysis of cancer patients was carried out here, comparing suicide risk between the genders, to elucidate the features specific to each gender. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1.3 million cancer cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to personal, tumor-related, and social variates. RESULTS: A total of 265 female and 1307 male suicides were enumerated, reflecting 0.04% and 0.19% from each gender, and providing an overall hazard ratio for male suicide of 6.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4-7.1]. Females with colorectal (P = 0.01) and cervical (P < 0.0001) cancers showed decreased suicide rates. Males with head and neck cancers (P < 0.0001) and myeloma (P = 0.02) had increased rates, whereas rates were decreased in males with lung cancer (P = 0.01), liver (P = 0.01), brain tumors (P = 0.04), and leukemia (P = 0.007). The hazard ratio associated for male suicide with distant metastasis was 2.84 (95% CI 2.49-3.24); for married status, 0.46 (95% CI 0.39-0.54); and for African-American ancestry, 0.24 (95% CI 0.17-0.34)-comparable ratios were seen here for female suicides. In head and neck cancers, with both genders analyzed together, the suicide hazard was increased if surgery was contraindicated (3.0, 95% CI 1.3-6.8), but not if refused. CONCLUSIONS: The high-risk patient was male, with head and neck cancer or myeloma, advanced disease, little social or cultural support, and limited treatment options. Oncologists and allied health professionals should be aware of the potential for suicide in cancer patients and their associated risk factors.","['Kendal, W S']",['Kendal WS'],"['Division of Radiation Oncology, The Ottawa Hospital Regional Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. wkendal@ottawahospital.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'Suicide/*psychology/statistics & numerical data']",2006/10/21 09:00,2007/05/09 09:00,['2006/10/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)37606-9 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdl385 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2007 Feb;18(2):381-7. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdl385.

As NAD superset+ is involved in cellular DNA repair processes, the present in vitro study on THP-1 and K562 leukemia cells was conducted to investigate the cytotoxicity of FK866 combination treatment with various cytotoxic agents: the antimetabolite Ara-C, the DNA-intercalating agent daunorubicin and the alkylating compounds 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidinium (MNNG) and melphalan. Cell viability after drug exposure was assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of FK866 (10 superset-9 M or less), applied simultaneously or 24 hours before adding cytotoxic agents, caused a depletion in the intracellular NAD superset+ and--to a lesser extent-- NADH levels in THP-1 cells. After 48 and 72 hours treatment with daunorubicin and Ara-C, respectively, increased cell death was observed in THP-1 cells that were pretreated with FK866, as compared to cells exposed to antineoplastic drugs alone. However, this effect was transient, and there was no difference in cell survival after 72 hours incubation with daunorubicin or 96 hours with Ara-C. - Non-toxic concentrations of FK866 added 8, 16, or 24 hours before starting treatment with the PARP-activating agent MNNG synergistically decreased intracellular NAD superset+ contents, and increased MNNG-induced cytotoxicity both in THP-1 and K562 cells for at least 72 hours. This effect was less pronounced when FK866 was used in combination with another alkylating agent, melphalan. The PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide delayed MNNG-induced cytotoxicity by 24 hours both in cells that were pretreated with FK866 and in non-pretreated cells. 48 hours later, the protective effect of 3-aminobenzamide could no longer be observed, but FK866-pretreated cells retained increased sensitivity to MNNG. - In conclusion, the chemosensitizing effect of FK866 on cell death induced by antineoplastic drugs was particularly obvious in combination with substances like MNNG that cause NAD superset+ depletion per se. It was less pronounced and only transiently measurable in combination with daunorubicin, Ara-C, and melphalan, respectively.

In this study, we used RT-PCR and FISH analysis to examine 224 Japanese adult de novo AML patients for the presence of the CBFB/MYH11 fusion transcript at the time of diagnosis. The CBFB/MYH11 fusion gene was detected in 17 patients (7.6%): eight patients had the inv(16) chromosome and in all of them it was M4E; nine patients did not have abnormalities in chromosome 16.

RasGRP1 possesses a catalytic region consisting of a REM (Ras exchange motif) and a CDC25 (cell division cycle 25) domain. RasGRP1 also possesses a DAG (diacylglycerol)-binding C1 domain and a pair of EF hands that bind calcium. RasGRP1 is selectively expressed in lymphocytes as well as in some cells of the brain, kidney and skin. Functional analysis supports the hypothesis that RasGRP1 serves to couple TCR (T-cell receptor) stimulation and phospholipase C activation with Ras signalling. In B-cells, both RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 play a similar role downstream of the B-cell receptor. RasGRP2 acts on the Ras-related protein Rap and functions in platelet adhesion. RasGRP4 is expressed in mast cells and certain myeloid leukaemia cells.

Described herein is the discovery that compound 13-D selectively induces apoptotic cell death in white blood cancer cell lines but not in other cancer cell lines. Further experiments indicate that this selectivity is not simply due to selective cell permeability. The compound localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and arrests cells in the prophase/prometaphase of the cell cycle, and there is a very sharp dependence of activity on compound structure, with the trans-alpha,beta-unsaturated amide of 13-D being critical for inducing cell death.

Accurate identification of prognostic factors is becoming increasingly important in order to determine those patients requiring aggressive treatments. Two of the most predictive outcome markers are the Ig VH mutational gene status and ZAP-70 expression. In earlier reports, both parameters have shown a high degree of concordance. To assess the value of these determinations in clinical practice, we simultaneously analyzed Ig VH mutations and ZAP-70 expression in a consecutive series of B-CLL. METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive B-CLL cases were included in the study. ZAP-70 expression was investigated by flow cytometry. Positivity was established using two methods: comparing ZAP70 expression in B-cells with T-cells using cytoplasmic CD3 (ZAP-70/T) and with NK-cell reactivity (ZAP-70/NK). The complete immunophenotype was recorded in each case. Ig VH mutational gene status was determined employing purified RNA from peripheral blood samples. Retrotranscribed DNA was PCR-amplified, direct-sequenced, and compared with available public databases. VH3.21 family use was also recorded. RESULTS: Using a T-cell marker, 58% of patients were ZAP-70+ and 42% were ZAP-70-. NK-cell comparisons gave only 6% of ZAP-70 positivity in B-CLL, and in six cases the absence of a clearly defined NK-cell population precluded the ZAP70 analysis. Twenty-four (45%) patients had mutated Ig VH genes and 29 (55%) had unmutated Ig VH genes. The results showed a statistical association between ZAP-70/T expression and VH mutational status. Despite this, in 30% of cases there was a discordant result. Immunophenotypic analysis showed no major differences in Matutes'score between mutated and nonmutated cases. Only FMC7 was more commonly expressed in the unmutated B-CLL cases. VH3.21 was present in 7.5% of cases, mostly having an unmutated pattern. CONCLUSIONS: ZAP-70 reactivity using a T-cell marker as a control allows to identify the majority of patients with an unmutated Ig VH genotype. Parallel analysis revealed that discordances with Ig VH analysis are quite common with currently employed flow cytometry reagents and techniques.","['Munoz, Luz', 'Lasa, Adriana', 'Carricondo, Maria T', 'Hernandez, Carmen', 'Ubeda, Josep', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F']","['Munoz L', 'Lasa A', 'Carricondo MT', 'Hernandez C', 'Ubeda J', 'Nomdedeu JF']","['Laboratory UDIAT, Corporacio Sanitaria Parc Tauli, Sabadell, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The aim of this study was to investigate dermatological findings presented by 30 members of a Brazilian family, half of whom are infected with HTLV-1 (as confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot). METHODS: The subjects underwent dermatologic examination and laboratory assessment, which included the search for the HTLV-1 genome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by qualitative and semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in skin samples by nested qualitative PCR and immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: We found that cases of xerotic dermatological alterations, including 3 cases of acquired ichthyosis, were more frequent among the infected patients (7 cases vs. none among the uninfected individuals; P=.0063). Other lesions observed in this group included impetigo, scabies, epidermal nevus, herpes zoster scar, rosacea, and juvenile acne. One HTLV-1-infected individual presented with concurrently acquired ichthyosis, impetigo, scabies, dermatophytosis, and seborrheic dermatitis. The PCR performed on PBMCs and skin samples from 24 patients confirmed the serological results in all cases. Additionally, the HTLV-1 proviral load was higher in patients with >1 skin lesion. Finally, HTLV-1 could be identified in the skin by immunofluorescence assay, which, by use of PCR as the gold standard, showed a sensitivity and specificity of 61.5% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these clinical and laboratory findings point to an HTLV-1 tropism toward the skin, even in HTLV-1 carriers without adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy and/or tropical spastic paraparesis.","['Nobre, Vandack', 'Guedes, Antonio Carlos', 'Martins, Marina Lobato', 'Barbosa-Stancioli, Edel Figueiredo', 'Serufo, Jose Carlos', 'Proietti, Fernando Augusto', 'Ribas, Joao Gabriel', 'Ferreira, Cibele Eponina Sanchez', 'Lambertucci, Jose Roberto']","['Nobre V', 'Guedes AC', 'Martins ML', 'Barbosa-Stancioli EF', 'Serufo JC', 'Proietti FA', 'Ribas JG', 'Ferreira CE', 'Lambertucci JR']","['Infectious Diseases Branch, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Brazil. vandack@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Carrier State/virology', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/physiopathology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology', 'Male', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/etiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin Diseases/epidemiology/physiopathology']",2006/10/20 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['CID40023 [pii]', '10.1086/508177 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2006 Nov 15;43(10):1257-63. doi: 10.1086/508177.

Patient cells were studied for the expression of ZAP-70 mRNA and its relation to the induction of apoptosis in response to treatment with genistein 15-60 muM and/or fludarabine 3 muM. The combination of genistein and fludarabine resulted in a significantly increased induction of apoptosis relative to the fludarabine alone. The ex vivo patient cells with a high ZAP-70 expression underwent more apoptosis in response to genistein than did patient cells with a low ZAP-70 mRNA expression. In contrast, basal IL-10 mRNA expression correlated negatively with apoptosis induction in response to genistein (P < 0.01). These studies suggest that, in malignant B cells that express elevated levels of the ZAP-70 signaling molecule, genistein may inhibit the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in cell death. The ZAP-70 may serve as a target for therapy. In addition, these studies suggest that the IL-10 expression by malignant B cells may not only suppress anti-tumor T cell responses in vivo, but also promote the survival of malignant B cells despite treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.","['Mansour, Amal', 'Chang, Victor T', 'Srinivas, Shanti', 'Harrison, Jonathan', 'Raveche, Elizabeth']","['Mansour A', 'Chang VT', 'Srinivas S', 'Harrison J', 'Raveche E']","['Department of Pathology, New Jersey Medical School, UMDNJ, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis/drug effects']",2006/10/20 09:00,2007/05/17 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0207-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2007 Apr;56(4):501-14. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0207-x.

We report here that TRAIL and SBHA synergistically induce apoptosis of melanoma cells as revealed by quantitative analysis using the normalized isobologram method. This is supported by enhanced activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of its substrates, PARP and ICAD. Co-treatment with SBHA and TRAIL did not enhance formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and processing of caspase-8 and Bid, but potentiated activation of Bax and release of Cytochrome C and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria into the cytosol. SBHA down-regulated Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1 and XIAP, but up-regulated Bax, Bak, and the BH3-only protein Bim(EL). Up-regulation of the latter by SBHA was attenuated by the presence of TRAIL, which was inhibitable by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Inhibition of Bim by siRNA attenuated conformational changes of Bax, mitochondrial apoptotic events, and activation of caspase-3, leading to marked inhibition of the synergy between SBHA and TRAIL. Thus, Bim plays an essential role in synergistic induction of apoptosis by SBHA and TRAIL in melanoma.","['Gillespie, Susan', 'Borrow, Jodie', 'Zhang, Xu Dong', 'Hersey, Peter']","['Gillespie S', 'Borrow J', 'Zhang XD', 'Hersey P']","['Immunology and Oncology Unit, Room 443, Newcastle Misericordiae Hospital, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (suberic bishydroxamate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2006/10/20 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-0283-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Dec;11(12):2251-65. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-0283-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric MRD assays are now sufficiently sensitive and rapid to guide the duration of therapy in CLL, but generally rely on assessment of CD20 expression, which cannot be accurately measured during and after therapeutic approaches containing rituximab. The aim of this study was to use analytical software developed for microarray analysis to provide a systematic approach for MRD flow assay development. Samples from CLL patients (n=49), normal controls (n=21) and other B-lymphoproliferative disorders (n=12) were assessed with a panel of 66 antibodies. The DNA-Chip analysis program was used to identify discriminating antibodies, with hierarchical cluster analysis to identify complementary combinations. An iterative process was used: increasing numbers of patients were assessed with smaller, more targeted antibody panels until a highly specific combination (CD81/CD22/CD19/CD5) was identified. This combination was as sensitive and specific as previously reported assays and potentially applicable to blood and marrow samples from patients treated with current therapeutic approaches including rituximab. This approach to the identification of disease-specific antibody combinations for MRD analysis is readily applicable to a variety of haematological disorders.","['Rawstron, A C', 'de Tute, R', 'Jack, A S', 'Hillmen, P']","['Rawstron AC', 'de Tute R', 'Jack AS', 'Hillmen P']","['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service (HMDS), Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, UK. andy.rawstron@hmds.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Rituximab']",2006/10/20 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404416 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404416 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2102-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404416.

Fifty-seven patients with AML in first relapse received GO at a dose of 3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4 and 7 for one course. Fifteen patients (26%) achieved CR and four (7%) CRp.

An anti-CD33 mAb coupled to a toxin, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), is used for the treatment of AML (Mylotarg). Therefore, we investigated whether the response of AML cells to GO treatment also depends on Syk expression. Forty primary AML samples (25 Syk-positive and 15 Syk-negative) were tested for their response to the anti-proliferative effects of GO and unmodified anti-CD33 mAb. A correlation between Syk expression and the response of leukemia cells to GO and anti-CD33 mAb was found. 'Blocking' of Syk by small interfering RNA resulted in unresponsiveness of AML cells to both GO and anti-CD33 mAb-mediated cytotoxicity. Syk upregulation by the de-methylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-aza) induced re-expression of Syk in some cases, resulting in enhanced GO and anti-CD33-mediated inhibition of leukemia cell growth. Thus, the cytotoxicity of both GO and anti-CD33 in primary AML samples was associated with Syk expression. 5-Aza restored Syk and increased the sensitivity of originally Syk-negative, non-responsive cells to CD33 ligation to levels of Syk-positive cells. These data have clinical significance for predicting response to GO and designing clinical trials.","['Balaian, L', 'Ball, E D']","['Balaian L', 'Ball ED']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Division, Department of Medicine and Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Syk Kinase']",2006/10/20 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404437 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404437 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2093-101. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404437.

Here, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of Rig-G in U937 cells can lead to a significant accumulation of cells at G(1)/S transition. Growth arrest seems to occur by modulating several major cell cycle regulatory players. Interestingly, Rig-G alters JAB1 cellular distribution through interacting with this protein and increases the intracellular level of p27 by preventing it from the JAB-1-dependent and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a role of Rig-G for c-myc down-regulation that results in an up-regulation of p21, tightly associated with cell cycle arrest. In addition, our studies reveal that Rig-G is a direct target of STAT1, a key transcription factor in regulating IFN responses, and may be one of the first experimentally proven molecular mediators for the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha. Considering that IFN-alpha and ATRA synergistically inhibit growth along the intracellular pathways triggered by the two compounds in many cell types, we suggest that Rig-G may also represent one of the key molecular nodes of signaling cross-talk between ATRA and IFN-alpha.","['Xiao, Shu', 'Li, Dong', 'Zhu, Hai-Qing', 'Song, Man-Gen', 'Pan, Xiao-Rong', 'Jia, Pei-Min', 'Peng, Lin-Ling', 'Dou, Ai-Xia', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Tong, Jian-Hua']","['Xiao S', 'Li D', 'Zhu HQ', 'Song MG', 'Pan XR', 'Jia PM', 'Peng LL', 'Dou AX', 'Chen GQ', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Tong JH']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui Jin Hospital, Health Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences and School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (IFIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferons/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/10/20 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['0607830103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0607830103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 31;103(44):16448-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0607830103.

The surface expression of the pre-TCR is pTalpha dependent, and signaling through this complex triggers an early alphabeta T-cell developmental checkpoint inside the thymus, known as beta-selection. E2A transcription factors, which are involved at multiple stages of T-cell development, regulate the transcription of the pTalpha gene. Here we show that the regulatory protein Tax of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) efficiently suppresses the E47-mediated activation of the pTalpha promoter. Furthermore, we report that in Tax lentivirally transduced human MOLT-4 T cells, which constitutively express the pTalpha gene, the amount of pTalpha transcripts decreases. Such a decrease is not observed in MOLT-4 cells transduced by a vector encoding the Tax mutant K88A, which is unable to interact with p300. These data underline that Tax inhibits pTalpha transcription by recruiting this coactivator. Finally, we show that the expression of Tax in human immature thymocytes results in a decrease of pTalpha gene transcription but does not modify the level of E47 transcripts. These observations indicate that Tax, by silencing E proteins, down-regulates pTalpha gene transcription during early thymocyte development. They further provide evidence that Tax can interfere with an important checkpoint during T-cell differentiation in the thymus.","['Wencker, Melanie', 'Sausse, Celine', 'Derse, David', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine']","['Wencker M', 'Sausse C', 'Derse D', 'Gazzolo L', 'Duc Dodon M']","[""Virologie Humaine U758, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 46 allee d'Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (pre-T cell receptor alpha)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/analysis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology']",2006/10/20 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00766-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00766-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jan;81(1):301-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00766-06.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen children (six boys and seven girls; mean age 15.5 years) who were treated for leukaemia were studied 5-6 years after cessation of therapy. Physical function and fitness were determined by anthropometry, motor performance, muscle strength, anaerobic and aerobic exercise capacity. RESULTS: On motor performance, seven of the 13 patients showed significant problems in the hand-eye co-ordination domain. Muscle strength only showed a significantly lower value in the mean strength of the knee extensors. The aerobic and the anaerobic capacity were both significantly reduced compared to reference values. CONCLUSION: Even 5-6 years after cessation of childhood leukaemia treatment, there are still clear late effects on motor performance and physical fitness. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and muscle atrophies are probably the prominent cause for these reduced test results. Physical training might be indicated for patients surviving leukaemia to improve fitness levels and muscle strength.","['van Brussel, Marco', 'Takken, Tim', 'van der Net, Janjaap', 'Engelbert, Raoul H H', 'Bierings, Marc', 'Schoenmakers, Marja A G C', 'Helders, Paul J M']","['van Brussel M', 'Takken T', 'van der Net J', 'Engelbert RH', 'Bierings M', 'Schoenmakers MA', 'Helders PJ']","['Department of Paediatric Physical Therapy & Exercise Physiology, University Hospital for Children and Youth Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Rehabil,Pediatric rehabilitation,9709256,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Muscular Atrophy/etiology', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Physical Fitness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology', '*Survival']",2006/10/20 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['J52P251723366442 [pii]', '10.1080/13638490500523150 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Rehabil. 2006 Jul-Sep;9(3):267-74. doi: 10.1080/13638490500523150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 4HC purging results in prolonged aplasia. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of ex vivo expansion of Mf-treated CD34+ cells from mobilized PBPC. METHODS: CD34+ cells were isolated from PBPC products and treated with 30 microg/mL Mf. The Mf-treated CD34+ cells were washed and cultured for 14 days in StemLine II-defined media containing recombinant human (rh) SCF, G-CSF and thrombopoietin (Tpo). RESULTS: Treatment with Mf resulted in 90% killing of progenitor cells (GM-CFC) but maintenance of SCID-repopulating cells (SRC). Ex vivo culture of the Mf-treated CD34+ cells resulted in decreased cell numbers (10-20% of the starting cell dose) during the first week. Nevertheless, in the second week of culture the total cell numbers expanded to approximately 20-fold above starting cell numbers and progenitor cells returned to approximately pre-treatment levels. DISCUSSION: These studies demonstrate the potential of ex vivo culture to expand both total cell numbers and progenitor cells following treatment of PBPC CD34+ cells with Mf. Clinical studies are currently being initiated to evaluate the engraftment potential of these purged and expanded products.","['McNiece, I', 'Civin, C', 'Harrington, J', 'Kellner, J', 'Malehorn, M', 'Turney, J', 'Barber, J', 'Jones, R']","['McNiece I', 'Civin C', 'Harrington J', 'Kellner J', 'Malehorn M', 'Turney J', 'Barber J', 'Jones R']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA. imcniec1@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2006/10/20 09:00,2006/12/29 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['N1639H4360061GX5 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240600905353 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2006;8(5):459-64. doi: 10.1080/14653240600905353.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flt3-ITD constitutively activates various signaling pathways, including a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and MEK inhibition were recently reported to interact synergistically to induce apoptosis in AML cells. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether ATO and Flt3 inhibition would be a more specific and efficient therapy for Flt3-ITD cells. We demonstrate that the combination of ATO and an Flt3 inhibitor, AG1296, profoundly inhibits the growth of Flt3-ITD cells and induces their apoptosis. We further revealed that this combined treatment potently inhibits the ERK activity that might be responsible for cell growth. Moreover, using the Chou-Talalay method, we observed a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect for ATO and AG1296 in Flt3-ITD cells (BaF3-Flt3-ITD, MV4-11, and PL-21 cells), but not in Flt3 wild-type cells (RS4-11 and NB4 cells), for almost all dose ranges tested.

Overexpression of this protein has been shown to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and the p38 MAP kinase pathways and to stimulate NF-AT and NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Here we have shown that Cot kinase activity is intimately involved in the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcvarepsilonRI)-mediated nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB1 independent of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. A transfected green fluorescent protein-tagged NF-kappaB1 (GFP-NF-kappaB1) resided in the cytoplasm in RBL-2H3 cells and it remained in the cytoplasm even when Cot tagged with red fluorescent protein (Cot-RFP) was co-expressed.

BMSCs influence tumor cells survival through several mechanisms including direct cell-cell contact and the effects of soluble factors. In this research we investigated the role of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in the apoptosis resistance mediated by stromal cells in HL-60 cells and the signaling pathway involved. We found that bone marrow stromal-derived soluble factors and direct cell contact both prevented apoptosis of HL-60 cells. XIAP is upregulated by direct cell contact but not by soluble factors. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt were activated and LY294002 downregulated XIAP and increased apoptosis in HL-60 cells co-cultured with BMSCs. The results indicated that PI3K/Akt/XIAP is an important pathway involved in the apoptosis resistance of HL-60 cells co-cultured with BMSCs by direct cell contact.

To understand the regulation of Pax6 pancreatic expression, we have identified a minimal Pax6 pancreatic enhancer and show that it contains a composite binding site for Meis and Pbx homeoproteins. We further show that Meis proteins are expressed during pancreatic development, and together with Pbx, are able to form a synergistic binding complex on the Pax6 pancreatic enhancer. When tested in transgenic mice, both the Meis and Pbx sites are essential for Pax6 pancreatic enhancer activity, and the composite site can be functionally replaced by a consensus Meis-Pbx sequence. In addition, analysis of Pbx1 and Pbx2 knockout mice demonstrates that, during pancreatic islet formation, Pax6 expression becomes dependent upon Pbx1 and Pbx2 function. As Meis homeoproteins have been previously demonstrated to regulate Pax6 expression during lens development, these results suggest a conserved mechanism of Pax6 regulation by Meis homeoproteins in two different organs.","['Zhang, Xin', 'Rowan, Sheldon', 'Yue, Yingzi', 'Heaney, Shaun', 'Pan, Yi', 'Brendolan, Andrea', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Maas, Richard L']","['Zhang X', 'Rowan S', 'Yue Y', 'Heaney S', 'Pan Y', 'Brendolan A', 'Selleri L', 'Maas RL']","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, 975 W.

Establishing reliable sensitivity factors in support of risk assessment of early-life stage exposures can be aided by evaluating studies that enhance our understanding both of the biological basis of disease processes and the potential role of environmental exposures in disease etiology. For these reasons, we evaluated childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) studies from the point of view of mechanism and etiology. ALL is the most common form of childhood cancer proposed to result from a prenatal primary event and a postnatal second event. This multi-stage model is supported by the observation that chromosomal translocations/fusion genes (e.g., TEL-AML1) involved in producing ALL are detected at birth (prenatal event), and a postnatal event (e.g., TEL deletion) is required for disease manifestation. It appears that a proportion of ALL cases are the result of environmental exposures, in which case preconceptional, prenatal, and postnatal stages are likely to be critical exposure windows. To this end, we recognized postnatal infection-related risk factors as potential candidates associated with the ALL second event. Additionally, we discuss use of ALL-associated fusion genes and genetic polymorphisms, together or separately, as indicators of ALL susceptibility and increased risk. The possibility of using fusion genes alone as biomarkers of response is also discussed because they can serve as predictors of key events in the development of a mode of action (a sequence of key events, starting with interaction of an agent with a cell, ultimately resulting in cancer formation) for particular environmental exposures. Furthermore, we discuss use of an initiated animal model for ALL, namely transgenic mice with TEL-AML1 expression, for exploring mechanisms by which different classes of environmental exposures could be involved in inducing the postnatal step in ALL formation.","['Kim, Andrea S', 'Eastmond, David A', 'Preston, R Julian']","['Kim AS', 'Eastmond DA', 'Preston RJ']","['National Center for Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue (MC: 8623D), Washington, DC 20460, USA. kim_andrea@allergan.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/10/20 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/10/20 09:00'],"['2006/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5742(06)00060-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrrev.2006.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 Nov-Dec;613(2-3):138-60. doi: 10.1016/j.mrrev.2006.09.001.

Increased erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is frequently found among DS infants and remains elevated throughout life in two-thirds of patients, making interpretation of red cell indices for diagnosis of nutritional anemias or bone marrow failure disorders more challenging. Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) associated with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and circulating immature WBCs, is found almost exclusively in DS infants with an incidence of approximately 10%. In most cases, TMD regresses spontaneously within the first 3 months of life, but in some children, it can be life threatening or even fatal. Despite the high rate of spontaneous regression, TMD can be a preleukemic disorder in 20-30% of children with DS. The types of malignancy, response to therapy, and clinical outcome in children with DS are also unique. There is an increased risk of leukemia with an equal incidence of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia. Acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) subtype is the most common form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this setting, and is uncommon in children without DS. Somatic mutations of the gene encoding the hematopoetic growth factor GATA1 have been shown to be specific for TMD and AMKL in children with DS. Myelodysplastic syndrome can precede AML. Children with DS and leukemia are more sensitive to some chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate than other children which requires careful monitoring for toxicity. Although the risk for leukemia is higher in individuals with DS, these patients have a lower risk of developing solid tumors, with the exception of germ cell tumors, and perhaps retinoblastoma and lymphoma.","['Dixon, Natalia', 'Kishnani, Priya S', 'Zimmerman, Sherri']","['Dixon N', 'Kishnani PS', 'Zimmerman S']","['Box 2916 DUMC, 222 Bell Building, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.

The structure of the final complex was determined by means of spectral data (IR, Raman,( 1)H-NMR) and elemental analysis. Significant differences in the IR spectrum of the complex were observed as compared to the spectrum of the ligand. A comparative analysis of the Raman spectrum of the complex with that of the free 5-aminoorotic acid allowed a straightforward assignment of the vibrations of the ligand groups involved in coordination.

We have studied eleven cases with the dic(17;20) or a more complex derivative, all of which showed deletion of 17p and 20q material. The tumor suppressor gene TP53 was not always lost, supporting a more distal gene as the target of these 17p deletions. All derivatives could be interpreted as having initially been formed as a dicentric chromosome, those with a larger amount of material between the centromeres having undergone further rearrangement to stabilize the chromosome while retaining proximal 17p and proximal 20q material. We propose that critical sequences on both 17p and 20q proximal to the sites of deletion must be retained during the critical 17p and 20q deletions. This would explain the excess of dicentric chromosomes resulting from 17;20 translocation, and the apparent stabilization of the unstable derivatives by further rearrangements which preserve 17p and 20q material.","['MacKinnon, Ruth N', 'Patsouris, Cris', 'Chudoba, Ilse', 'Campbell, Lynda J']","['MacKinnon RN', 'Patsouris C', 'Chudoba I', 'Campbell LJ']","[""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Australia. ruth.mackinnon@svhm.org.au""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/10/19 09:00,2007/01/30 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20385 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 Jan;46(1):27-36. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20385.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We were interested in the regulation of BRCA1 expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), in particular in therapy-related forms (t-AML). Using real-time PCR and Western blot, we found that BRCA1 mRNA was expressed at barely detectable levels by normal peripheral blood granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes, whereas control BM-mononuclear cells and selected CD34+ progenitor cells displayed significantly higher BRCA1 expression (P=0.0003). Acute myeloid leukaemia samples showed heterogeneous BRCA1 mRNA levels, which were lower than those of normal bone marrows (P=0.0001). We found a high frequency of hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter region in AML (51/133 samples, 38%), in particular in patients with karyotypic aberrations (P=0.026), and in t-AML, as compared to de novo AML (76 vs 31%, P=0.0002). Examining eight primary tumour samples from hypermethylated t-AML patients, BRCA1 was hypermethylated in three of four breast cancer samples, whereas it was unmethylated in the other four tumours. BRCA1 hypermethylation correlated to reduced BRCA1 mRNA (P=0.0004), and to increased DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A (P=0.003) expression. Our data show that reduced BRCA1 expression owing to promoter hypermethylation is frequent in t-AML and that this could contribute to secondary leukaemogenesis.","['Scardocci, A', 'Guidi, F', ""D'Alo', F"", 'Gumiero, D', 'Fabiani, E', 'Diruscio, A', 'Martini, M', 'Larocca, L M', 'Zollino, M', 'Hohaus, S', 'Leone, G', 'Voso, M T']","['Scardocci A', 'Guidi F', ""D'Alo' F"", 'Gumiero D', 'Fabiani E', 'Diruscio A', 'Martini M', 'Larocca LM', 'Zollino M', 'Hohaus S', 'Leone G', 'Voso MT']","[""Istituti di Ematologia, di, Universita' Cattolica Sacro Cuore, L.go A.

Activation of NF-kappaB has also been associated with apoptosis and proliferation, thereby potentially also controlling oncogenesis. A functional insertion/deletion polymorphism has been identified in the promoter region of NFKB1, which apparently controls the transcription of NF-kappaB. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to investigate associations of the -94ins/delATTG polymorphism with susceptibility and survival of patients with different types of cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genotype distributions in patients with colorectal carcinoma (n=139), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=72) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n=140), and in controls (n=307) were analyzed by pyrosequencing and compared with each other as well as associated with clinico-pathological parameters and demographic data. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in both allele and genotype frequencies were observed between patients and healthy controls. Likewise, no association between -94ins/delATTG alleles and survival or disease progression was noticed.

In contrast, stable expression of IFN-beta following adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer resulted in significant antileukemic activity against primary AML cells derived from patients with poor prognostic markers. An almost linear relationship was observed with stable plasma levels of IFN-beta and antileukemic activity in mice. Even levels below 10 IU/mL were able to reduce tumor load by 50-fold when compared with control animals. These levels of IFN-beta are likely to be nontoxic in humans.

To study resistance to TKIs targeting FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently mutated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we developed resistant human cell lines through prolonged coculture with FLT3 TKIs. FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines and primary samples still exhibit inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation on FLT3 TKI treatment. However, FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines and primary samples often show continued activation of downstream PI3K/Akt and/or Ras/MEK/MAPK signaling pathways as well as continued expression of genes involved in FLT3-mediated cellular transformation. Inhibition of these signaling pathways restores partial sensitivity to FLT3 TKIs. Mutational screening of FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines revealed activating N-Ras mutations in 2 cell lines that were not present in the parental FLT3 TKI-sensitive cell line. Taken together, these data indicate that FLT3 TKI-resistant cells most frequently become FLT3 independent because of activation of parallel signaling pathways that provide compensatory survival/proliferation signals when FLT3 is inhibited. Anti-FLT3 mAb treatment was still cytotoxic to FLT3 TKI-resistant clones.

Here, we investigated the role of the histone lysine methyltransferase MLL for angiogenic functions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Suppression of MLL expression by siRNA or incubation with the pharmacologic methyltransferase inhibitor 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine significantly decreased endothelial-cell migration and capillary sprout formation, indicating that methyltransferase activity is required for proangiogenic endothelial-cell functions. Because the expression of homeodomain transcription factors (Hox) is regulated by MLL, we elucidated the role of Hox gene expression. MLL silencing was associated with reduced mRNA and protein expression of HoxA9 and HoxD3, whereas HoxB3, HoxB4, HoxB5, and HoxB9 were not altered. Overexpression of HoxA9 or HoxD3 partially compensated for impaired migration in MLL siRNA-transfected endothelial cells, suggesting that HoxA9 and HoxD3 both contribute to MLL-dependent migration. As a potential underlying mechanism, MLL siRNA down-regulated mRNA and protein levels of the HoxA9-dependent axon guidance factor EphB4. In contrast, MLL knockdown effects on capillary sprouting were not rescued by HoxA9 or HoxD3 overexpression, indicating that MLL affects additional targets required for 3-dimensional sprout formation. We conclude that MLL regulates endothelial-cell migration via HoxA9 and EphB4, whereas sprout formation requires MLL-dependent signals beyond HoxA9 and HoxD3.","['Diehl, Florian', 'Rossig, Lothar', 'Zeiher, Andreas M', 'Dimmeler, Stefanie', 'Urbich, Carmen']","['Diehl F', 'Rossig L', 'Zeiher AM', 'Dimmeler S', 'Urbich C']","['Molecular Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Movement', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",2006/10/19 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41987-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-08-039651 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 15;109(4):1472-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-039651.

The MLL-cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) fusion requires both the CBP bromodomain and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain for transformation and causes acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), often preceded by a myelodysplastic phase. We did domain-swapping experiments to define whether unique specificities of these CBP domains drive this specific MLL phenotype. Within MLL-CBP, we replaced the CBP bromodomain or HAT domain with P300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) or TAF(II)250 bromodomains or the P/CAF or GCN5 HAT domains. HAT, but not bromodomain, substitutions conferred enhanced proliferative capacity in vitro but lacked expression of myeloid cell surface markers normally seen with MLL-CBP. Mice reconstituted with domain-swapped hematopoietic progenitors developed different disease from those with MLL-CBP. This included development of lymphoid disease and lower frequency of the myelodysplastic phase in those mice developing AML. We conclude that both the CBP bromodomain and HAT domain play different but critical roles in determining the phenotype of MLL-CBP leukemia. Our results support an important role for MLL partner genes in determining the leukemia phenotype besides their necessity in leukemogenesis. Here, we find that subtleties in MLL fusion protein domain specificity direct cells toward a specific disease phenotype.","['Santillan, Donna A', 'Theisler, Catherine M', 'Ryan, Amanda S', 'Popovic, Relja', 'Stuart, Tara', 'Zhou, Ming-Ming', 'Alkan, Serhan', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Santillan DA', 'Theisler CM', 'Ryan AS', 'Popovic R', 'Stuart T', 'Zhou MM', 'Alkan S', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology/metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Substrate Specificity', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2006/10/19 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/20/10032 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2597 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 15;66(20):10032-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2597.,,,"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95040/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07508/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we showed that the MPDs in SPA-1(-/-) mice were associated with the increased hematopoietic stem cells expressing LFA-1 in bone marrow and their premature mobilization to spleen with extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis, resembling human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We further showed that human BCR-ABL oncogene caused a partial down-regulation of endogenous SPA-1 gene expression in mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) and immature hematopoietic cell lines. Although both BCR-ABL-transduced wild-type (wt) and SPA-1(-/-) HPC rapidly developed CML-like MPD when transferred to severe combined immunodeficient mice, the latter recipients showed significantly increased proportions of BCR-ABL(+) Lin(-) c-Kit(+) cells compared with the former ones. Serial transfer experiments revealed that spleen cells of secondary recipients of BCR-ABL(+) wt HPC failed to transfer MPD to tertiary recipients due to a progressive reduction of BCR-ABL(+) Lin(-) c-Kit(+) cells. In contrast, SPA-1(-/-) BCR-ABL(+) Lin(-) c-Kit(+) cells were sustained at high level in secondary recipients, and their spleen cells could transfer MPD to tertiary recipients, a part of which rapidly developed blast crisis. Present results suggest that endogenous SPA-1 plays a significant role in regulating expansion and/or survival of BCR-ABL(+) leukemic progenitors albeit partial repression by BCR-ABL and that Rap1 signal may represent a new molecular target for controlling leukemic progenitors in CML.","['Kometani, Kohei', 'Aoki, Misayo', 'Kawamata, Shin', 'Shinozuka, Yoriko', 'Era, Takumi', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Hattori, Masakazu', 'Minato, Nagahiro']","['Kometani K', 'Aoki M', 'Kawamata S', 'Shinozuka Y', 'Era T', 'Taniwaki M', 'Hattori M', 'Minato N']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Sipa1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2006/10/19 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/20/9967 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1346 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 15;66(20):9967-76. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although accumulation of misfolded proteins is known to trigger UPR-induced cytotoxic cell death in several neurodegenerative disorders, APL cells are notably resistant to UPR-induced apoptosis. The molecular basis for the paradoxical response of APL cells to UPR is not known. Here, we report that a glycoprotease, selectively expressed in APL cells, regulates the response of APL cells to UPR-induced apoptosis through processing of misfolded N-CoR protein. Results show that misfolded N-CoR is cleaved selectively in APL cells, and cellular extracts of APL cells and human primary APL cells contain activity that cleaves N-CoR protein. Purification and spectrometric analysis of N-CoR cleaving activity from an APL cell line reveals that it is a glycoprotein endopeptidase known as OSGEP. Furthermore, the cleavage of N-CoR in APL cells could be blocked by the broad-spectrum protease inhibitor AEBSF and by RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of OSGEP expression. AEBSF selectively inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis of APL cells possibly through a mechanism involving AEBSF-induced accumulation of insoluble N-CoR protein and by triggering ER stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that selective induction of protease activity in APL cells may represent a novel cytoprotective component of UPR, which could be exploited by tumor cells to survive the toxic insult of misfolded protein(s).","['Ng, Angela Ping Ping', 'Howe Fong, Jek', 'Sijin Nin, Dawn', 'Hirpara, Jayshree L', 'Asou, Norio', 'Chen, Chien-Shing', 'Pervaiz, Shazib', 'Khan, Matiullah']","['Ng AP', 'Howe Fong J', 'Sijin Nin D', 'Hirpara JL', 'Asou N', 'Chen CS', 'Pervaiz S', 'Khan M']","['Oncology Research Institute, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sulfones)', '34284-75-8 (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.57 (O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/physiology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Folding', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2006/10/19 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/20/9903 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 15;66(20):9903-12. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using mass spectrometry combined with reversed-phase liquid chromatography, we could sequence 188 HLA class I-restricted candidate peptides from three ATL-derived cell lines. In accordance with the restrained expression of HTLV-I viral RNA in these cell lines, there were no HTLV-I-encoded peptides among these candidates. Based on the differential expression between ATL cells and normal CD4+ T cells, we selected 10 novel peptides as T cell epitopes of overexpressed source proteins. RT-PCR analysis revealed that 5 source proteins including PRAME, a known tumor-testis antigen, were highly expressed in the majority of 16 ATL cases. Furthermore we could induce PRAME-specific CTLs in vitro from an HLA-B62+ healthy donor that showed specific cytotoxicity against HLA-B62+ PRAME+ ATL cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that comprehensive analysis of HLA class I-bound peptides by mass spectrometry is useful for identification of TAA-derived peptides in ATL.

METHODS: The methylation status of control CBA/H and C57BL/6 mouse tissues before and after exposure to 3-Gy x-rays, and myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas, was assessed by the direct analysis of the 5-methylcytosine (5-(Me)C) content of DNA, and by Southern blot analysis of genomic repeat sequences. RESULTS: The DNA 5-(Me)C content of bone marrow is 15% lower than spleen. Together with the analyses of stem (myeloid) and progenitor (lymphoid) leukemias and lymphomas, we found a trend of increasing methylation during hemopoietic differentiation. Exposure to x-rays induced greater cell death in the hypomethylated bone marrow (>80%) than spleen (50%) in vivo, supporting the observed correlation found between methylation status and radiosensitivity of other high-turnover hierarchical tissues. Furthermore, there was an 8% DNA 5-(Me)C content decrease in bone marrow after in vivo exposure to 3-Gy x-rays, but this was genotype dependent, being observed in AML-susceptible (CBA/H) but not AML-resistant (C57BL/6) inbred mice.

Since preliminary data have shown that 6-thioguanine is more effective than 6-mercaptopurine, we compared the efficacy and toxicity of the two drugs for childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: Consecutive children with lymphoblastic leukaemia diagnosed in the UK and Ireland between April, 1997, and June, 2002, were randomly assigned either 6-thioguanine (750 patients) or 6-mercaptopurine (748 patients) during interim maintenance and continuing therapy. All patients received 6-thioguanine during intensification courses. We analysed event-free and overall survival on an intention-to-treat basis. We obtained toxicity data using an adverse-event reporting system, with follow-up questionnaires to seek detailed information for specific toxicities. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Number 26727615 with the name ALL97. FINDINGS: After a median follow up of 6 years, there was no difference in event-free or overall survival between the two treatment groups. Although 6-thioguanine conferred a significantly lower risk of isolated CNS relapse than did 6-mercaptopurine (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.92, p=0.02), the benefit was offset by an increased risk of death in remission (2.22, 1.20-4.14, p=0.01), mainly due to infections during continuing therapy. Additionally, 95 patients developed veno-occlusive disease of the liver. Of these, 82 were randomly assigned 6-thioguanine, representing 11% of all 6-thioguanine recipients. On long-term follow-up, about 5% of 6-thioguanine recipients have evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension due to periportal liver fibrosis or nodular regenerative hyperplasia.

In the present study, we investigated the effect on pregnancy outcome of the administration of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to recombinant human (rh) LIF (anti-LIF mAb) into the uterine cavity of mated female rhesus monkeys during the peri-implantation period. METHODS: Two milligrams of either mouse mAb to rhLIF or isotype-matched immunoglobulin (Ig) was administered into the uterine cavity on estimated Day 5 or Day 8 after ovulation either through the vagina (n=33) or through the oviduct (n=29) of successfully mated females. RESULTS: There was a significant (p<.04) decline in pregnancy outcome in groups treated with anti-LIF mAb (8 pregnancies from 32 animals) compared with control animals (24 pregnancies from 30 animals). There was, however, no significant difference in pregnancy inhibition between a group of animals subjected to vaginal route treatment and a group of animals subjected to oviductal route treatment, as well as between a group subjected to anti-LIF mAb on Day 5 after ovulation and a group subjected to anti-LIF mAb on Day 8 after ovulation. No significant change was seen in the number of viable pregnancy in animals treated with 6 mg of anti-LIF mAb (5 pregnancies from 16 animals) compared with animals treated with 2 mg of anti-LIF mAb (8 pregnancies from 32 animals). Serum profiles of estradiol, progesterone, monkey chorionic gonadotropin and mouse IgG did not show any difference among different treatment subgroups during the luteal phase. However, among animals treated with anti-LIF mAb, the mean area under the curve for serum mouse IgG in pregnant animals (234+/-55 microg/mL day) was significantly (p<.01) less than that of nonpregnant animals (1325+/-97 microg/mL day). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study put forward the proof of concept that LIF plays a critical role in the process of blastocyst implantation in the rhesus monkey.","['Sengupta, Jayasree', 'Lalitkumar, Parameswaran G L', 'Najwa, Abdur R', 'Ghosh, Debabrata']","['Sengupta J', 'Lalitkumar PG', 'Najwa AR', 'Ghosh D']","['Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Contraception,Contraception,0234361,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Birth Weight', 'Blastocyst/*drug effects/immunology', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/blood', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Progesterone/blood']",2006/10/19 09:00,2007/01/12 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0010-7824(06)00253-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.contraception.2006.05.070 [doi]']",ppublish,Contraception. 2006 Nov;74(5):419-25. doi: 10.1016/j.contraception.2006.05.070.

FeLIX is expressed from endogenous FeLV-related sequence and resembles the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral envelope protein. It remains unclear whether FeLV-T receptor activity requires specific residues within FePit1 and FeLIX and/or a threshold level of receptor/cofactor expression. To address this, we examined FeLV-T infection of cells expressing variable levels of FePit1 and other gammaretroviral receptors in the presence of variable amounts of soluble cofactor, either RBD or the envelope surface subunit (SU). Cofactor-receptor pairs fall into three groups with regard to mediating FeLV-T infection: those that are efficient at all concentrations tested, such as FePit1 and FeLIX; those requiring high expression of both cofactor and receptor; and those that are non-functional as receptors even at high expression. This suggests that both expression levels and specific interactions with receptor and cofactor are critical for mediating entry of FeLV-T.","['Cheng, Heather H', 'Anderson, Maria M', 'Overbaugh, Julie']","['Cheng HH', 'Anderson MM', 'Overbaugh J']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (FeLIX protein, feline leukemia virus)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/growth & development/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Internalization']",2006/10/19 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00647-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 Mar 1;359(1):170-8. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.09.004.

All particle preparations showed a defined pattern of endogenous retroviral sequences that differed from the cellular HERV expression pattern.

Proliferation and differentiation pathways determine, in part, the number of NTs in cells and tissues. In this study, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells resulted in biphasic changes in guanosine transport. Transient increases in csg and es activity, the result of an increase in V(max) (pmol/muls) of both transporter systems, served as early markers of differentiation while expression of a fully differentiated phenotype was accompanied by a selective loss of csg activity and the return of es activity to that of proliferating cells. Intracellular incorporation of [(3)H]-guanosine decreased as cells matured despite increased transport rates and suggested a reduced intracellular requirement of NB4-granulocytes compared to their proliferating counterparts. Whether a loss of csg activity could serve to assess clinical response to differentiation therapies is not known. Nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) binding sites within nuclear membrane (NM) preparations, suggested the presence of functional intracellular NTs. An increase in plasma membrane (PM) associated transporters coincided with the early increase in guanosine transport and a decrease in NBMPR binding to NM fractions and suggests that intracellular NTs may serve as a reserve pool for translocation to the (PM) when additional transport capacity is required. The modulation of transporters during differentiation could potentially regulate drug bioavailability and cytotoxicity and should be evaluated prior to combining differentiating agents with traditional nucleoside analogs in the treatment of APL.","['Flanagan, Sheryl A', 'Meckling, Kelly A']","['Flanagan SA', 'Meckling KA']","['Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Guanosine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Uridine/metabolism']",2006/10/19 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00348-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Jul;31(7):955-68. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.09.010.

METHODS: Adult male SD rats (n 36) were divided into the normal group, the asthmatic group and the anti-NGF group at random. There were 12 rats in each group. The asthma models were established by sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin, and the asthma model was treated with anti-NGF. The expression of NGF, LIF and substance P (SP) in lung tissue or in doral root ganglion of each rat were detected by immunohistochemistry and hybridisation in situ. RESULTS: (1) The gray-levels of NGF protein/NGF mRNA, LIF protein/LIF mRNA in the lungs were 157 +/- 7, 138 +/- 8, 156 +/- 6, 141 +/- 10 for the asthmatic group respectively, 183 +/- 7, 190 +/- 7, 187 +/- 7, 181 +/- 8 for the normal control group respectively, and 177 +/- 6, 169 +/- 9, 178 +/- 7, 172 +/- 9 for the asthmatic group with anti-NGF treatment. There were significant differences in gray-level of NGF protein/NGF mRNA, LIF protein/LIF mRNA among those three groups (t = 19.40, 15.80, 20.38, [corrected] 14.79, all P < 0.01).

METHODS: The expression of MDR(1), Topo II and GCR in 189 patients with lymphoid neoplasms was examined by RT-PCR, slot blot and ligand-labelled methods. RESULTS: (1) The expressions of MDR(1), Topo II, GCR in untreated and relapsed/refractory patients with ALL, NHL, NHL-L, MM were significantly abnormal at varying levels, especially in the relapsed/refractory group. (2) The complete remission (CR) rate of MDR(1) high expression group (MDR(1)(+)) was significantly lower than that of MDR(1) negative expression (MDR(1)(-)) group (P < 0.05), and the relapse rate of MDR(1)(+) group was significantly higher than that of MDR(1)(-) group (P < 0.05). In untreated patients, the relapse rate in the Topo II low expression (Topo II(-)) group was positively higher than Topo II high expression (Topo II(+)) group (P < 0.05), whereas in the relapsed/refractory patients, the CR rate of Topo II(-) group was significantly lower than that of Topo II(+) group (P < 0.05). In the untreated and relapsed/refractory patients, the CR rates of low GCR expression (GCR(-)) group was obviously lower than that in the normal GCR expression group (P < 0.05). (3) Considering mono-drug resistance mechanism, CR rate of MDR(1)(+) group was the lowest, Topo II(-) group took the second place and GCR(-) group was the highest.

CONCLUSION: There are primary and acquired drug resistance in lymphoid neoplasms. The high expression of MDR(1), low expression of Topo II and GCR are positively related to low chemotherapy response rate and high 2-year relapse rate.

KIT plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation and represents a logical therapeutic target in GIST and CML. In pancreatic cancer, c-kit expression has been observed by immunohistochemical techniques. In this study, we examined the influence of c-kit expression on proliferation and invasion using five pancreatic cancer cell lines. In addition, the inhibitory effect of imatinib mesylate on stem cell factor (SCF)-induced proliferation and invasion was evaluated. Finally, we also analyzed KIT and SCF expression in pancreatic cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry and correlated the results with clinical features. RESULTS: RT-PCR revealed that two pancreatic cancer cell lines, PANC-1 and SW1990, expressed c-kit mRNA. By Western blot analysis, c-kit protein was also present in those lines. In KIT-positive pancreatic cancer cell lines, proliferation and invasion were significantly enhanced by addition of SCF. In contrast, SCF did not enhance proliferation and invasion in the three KIT-negative lines (BxPC-3, Capan-2 and MIA PaCa-2). 5 muM imatinib mesylate significantly inhibited SCF-enhanced proliferation to the same extent compared with the control. Similarly, SCF-enhanced invasive ability was significantly inhibited by 5 muM imatinib mesylate. KIT was expressed in 16 of 42 clinical specimens by immunohistochemistry, and KIT expression was significantly related to venous system invasion. Furthermore, patients expressing both KIT and SCF had a somewhat lower survival. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the SCF-KIT pathway enhanced the proliferation and invasiveness in KIT-positive pancreatic cancer cell lines and that the enhanced proliferation and invasion were inhibited by imatinib mesylate. We propose that inhibitors of c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor have the potential to slow the progression of KIT-positive pancreatic cancers.","['Yasuda, Akira', 'Sawai, Hirozumi', 'Takahashi, Hiroki', 'Ochi, Nobuo', 'Matsuo, Yoichi', 'Funahashi, Hitoshi', 'Sato, Mikinori', 'Okada, Yuji', 'Takeyama, Hiromitsu', 'Manabe, Tadao']","['Yasuda A', 'Sawai H', 'Takahashi H', 'Ochi N', 'Matsuo Y', 'Funahashi H', 'Sato M', 'Okada Y', 'Takeyama H', 'Manabe T']","['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, 4678601, Japan. a-yasuda@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/*metabolism']",2006/10/19 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-4598-5-46 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-5-46 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2006 Oct 18;5:46. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-5-46.,20061018,,,PMC1634869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Age-adjusted incidence rates were 1.62/10(6)/yr for women and 7.97/10(6)/yr for men, with rates 1.5 times higher in Jewish than in non-Jewish (mainly Arab) men. Mean overall survival also differed by ethnicity. In a multivariate model, increasing age at diagnosis (P < 0.001), as well as Arab origin (P = 0.008) were associated with poorer survival but gender did not significantly affect the survival after controlling for age and ethnicity. Other primary malignancies were reported in 20 (11%) individuals, with a predominance of genito-urinary tumors (65%) among males. Secondary genito-urinary tumors were significantly increased above the expected population rates (SIR 3.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.39-6.36, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In the Israeli population, age and ethnicity were associated with prognosis of HCL. Variations in disease characteristics, stage of disease at diagnosis or differential access to treatment may contribute to these findings. Patients with HCL appear to be at increased risk for genito-urinary malignancies.","['Paltiel, Ora', 'Adler, Bella', 'Barchana, Micha', 'Dann, Eldad J']","['Paltiel O', 'Adler B', 'Barchana M', 'Dann EJ']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel. ora@vms.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Arabs', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Jews', '*Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/ethnology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/mortality/secondary']",2006/10/19 09:00,2006/12/28 09:00,['2006/10/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH732 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00732.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Nov;77(5):372-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00732.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examine how gene expression profiles reflect aneuploidy and whether these profiles can be used to detect changes in chromosome copy number. We developed two methods for detecting such changes in the gene expression profile of a single sample. The first method, fold-change analysis, relies on the availability of gene expression data from a large cohort of patients with the same disease. The expression profile of the sample is compared with that of the dataset. The second method, chromosomal relative expression analysis, is more general and requires the expression data from the tested sample only. We found that the relative expression values are stable among different chromosomes and exhibit little variation between different normal tissues. We exploited this novel finding to establish the set of reference values needed to detect changes in the copy number of chromosomes in a single sample on the basis of gene expression levels. We measured the accuracy of the performance of each method by applying them to two independent leukemia datasets. The second method was also applied to two solid tumor datasets. We conclude that chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected and predicted by analysis of gene expression profiles.

Expression of BACH2 is induced in BCR-ABL positive lymphoid cell lines including BV173 by imatinib, a molecular targeting agent for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here we show that the activity of the BACH2 gene is related to the nuclear positioning of the gene loci. We examined the spatial association of the BACH2 gene with the centromeric heterochromatin, a transcriptionally repressive subnuclear compartment, by comparing cells with low (BV173 and K562) and high (NAMALWA) levels of BACH2 mRNA. The BACH2 gene was located closer to the centromeric heterochromatin in BV173 and K562 cells as compared to NAMALWA cells. In BV173 cells, the BACH2-centromere distance increased after imatinib treatment to levels similar to those in NAMALWA cells. We also found that diethylmaleate, an oxidative stressor, enhanced the antiproliferative effect of imatinib in only BV173 cells. Since BACH2 induces apoptosis by oxidative stress, these observations suggest that down-regulation of the BACH2 gene through the interaction with centromeric heterochromatin would take part in leukomogenesis of BCR-ABL positive lymphoid leukemia.","['Ono, Atsushi', 'Kono, Kazuteru', 'Ikebe, Dai', 'Muto, Akihiko', 'Sun, Jiying', 'Kobayashi, Masao', 'Ueda, Kazuhiro', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Igarashi, Kazuhiko', 'Tashiro, Satoshi']","['Ono A', 'Kono K', 'Ikebe D', 'Muto A', 'Sun J', 'Kobayashi M', 'Ueda K', 'Melo JV', 'Igarashi K', 'Tashiro S']","['Department of Cellular Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Graduate school of Biomedical Science, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BACH2 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'G81WQB56OL (diethyl maleate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Heterochromatin', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Maleates/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",2006/10/18 09:00,2007/01/30 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20390 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 Jan;46(1):67-74. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20390.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DISCUSSION: Radiation-induced neoplasia is suggested to be the late complication of ALL treatment, and evaluation of large clinical series revealed a relationship between young age at ALL diagnosis (<6 years) and increased high-grade glioma occurrence risk. CONCLUSION: The authors have reviewed previously reported cases of secondary central nervous system malignancies focusing on age at ALL diagnosis, and they think that synergistic action of therapeutic modalities could have played a role in the oncogenetic process.

Reduced reactivity of CTL towards tumour cells could thus lead to disease progression and loss of tumour control. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), the function of tumour-reactive CTL seems to correlate inversely to disease stage. Inhibitory NK cell receptors are known to suppress the CTL response upon interaction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and increased expression of such receptors on CTL may inhibit the anti-tumour response. So, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of NK cell inhibitory receptors on CTL in B-CLL patients and if such expression correlated to disease stage. CD8+ T cells from B-CLL patients in Binet stage A (n = 26) and stage C (n = 14) and healthy controls (n = 14) were analysed for the expression of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) CD158a (KIR2DL1), CD158b (KIR2DL2), CD158e (KIR3DL1) and the C-type lectin receptor CD94, by flow cytometry analysis. Patients with advanced disease (Binet stage C) had a significantly greater percentage of CTL expressing CD158b, CD158e and CD94 than patients with non-progressive disease (Binet stage A) and healthy controls. Stage C patients also had a significantly higher percentage of CTL expressing CD158a than stage A patients. No statistically significant differences were found between Binet A patients and healthy controls. Our results suggest that increased expression of KIR and CD94 on CTL in advanced stage B-CLL may potentially contribute to the impaired anti-tumour immune response in these patients.","['Junevik, Katarina', 'Werlenius, Olle', 'Hasselblom, Sverker', 'Jacobsson, Stefan', 'Nilsson-Ehle, Herman', 'Andersson, Per-Ola']","['Junevik K', 'Werlenius O', 'Hasselblom S', 'Jacobsson S', 'Nilsson-Ehle H', 'Andersson PO']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (KIR2DL2 protein, human)', '0 (KIR3DL1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL1)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL2)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR2DL1', 'Receptors, KIR2DL2', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3', 'Receptors, KIR3DL1', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*metabolism']",2006/10/18 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-006-0198-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2007 Feb;86(2):89-94. doi: 10.1007/s00277-006-0198-x.

In humans and most animals, As(III) is enzymatically methylated in the liver to weakly toxic dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)) that is a major pentavalent methylarsenic metabolite. Recent reports have indicated that trivalent methylarsenicals are produced through methylation of As(III) and participate in arsenic poisoning. Trivalent methylarsenicals may be generated as arsenical-glutathione conjugates, such as dimethylarsinous glutathione (DMAs(III)G), during the methylation process. However, less information is available on the cytotoxicity of DMAs(III)G. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We synthesized and purified DMAs(III)G using high performance TLC (HPTLC) methods and measured its cytotoxicity in rat liver cell line (TRL 1215 cells). KEY RESULTS: DMAs(III)G was highly cytotoxic in TRL 1215 cells with a LC(50) of 160 nM. We also found that DMAs(III)G molecule itself was not transported efficiently into the cells and was not cytotoxic; however it readily became strongly cytotoxic by dissociating into trivalent dimethylarsenicals and glutathione (GSH). The addition of GSH in micromolar physiological concentrations prevented the breakdown of DMAs(III)G, and the DMAs(III)G-induced cytotoxicity. Physiological concentrations of normal human serum (HS), human serum albumin (HSA), and human red blood cells (HRBC) also reduced both the cytotoxicity and cellular arsenic uptake induced by exposure to DMAs(III)G. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that the significant cytotoxicity induced by DMAs(III)G may not be seen in healthy humans, even if DMAs(III)G is formed in the body from As(III).","['Sakurai, T', 'Kojima, C', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Hirano, S', 'Sakurai, M H', 'Waalkes, M P', 'Himeno, S']","['Sakurai T', 'Kojima C', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Hirano S', 'Sakurai MH', 'Waalkes MP', 'Himeno S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Nutrition and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Yamashiro-cho, Tokushima, Japan. teruaki@ph.bunri-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (dimethylarsinous acid)', '9XX54M675G (darinaparsin)', 'AJ2HL7EU8K (Cacodylic Acid)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Arsenic Poisoning/metabolism', 'Arsenicals/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Arsenites/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Cacodylic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythrocytes', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Hepatocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Methylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2006/10/18 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['0706899 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjp.0706899 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2006 Dec;149(7):888-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706899.

Recently, we demonstrated that besides triggering apoptosis in K562 cells, imatinib also mediated their erythroid differentiation. Although both events appear to proceed concomitantly, it is not known at present whether or not imatinib-induced apoptosis and differentiation are interdependent processes. Hence, we investigated the requirements for Bcr-Abl inhibitor-mediated apoptosis and erythroid differentiation in several established and engineered CML cell lines. Imatinib triggered apoptosis and erythroid differentiation of different CML cell lines, but only apoptosis exhibited sensitivity to ZVAD-fmk inhibition. Conversely, the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor, SB202190, significantly slowed down erythroid differentiation without affecting caspase activation. Furthermore, imatinib and PD166326, another Bcr-Abl inhibitory molecule, triggered erythroid differentiation of K562 cell clones, nevertheless resistant to Bcr-Abl inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Finally, short hairpin RNA inhibitor (shRNAi) silencing of caspase 3 efficiently inhibited caspase activity but had no effect on erythroid differentiation, whereas silencing of Bcr-Abl mimicked imatinib or PD166326 treatment, leading to increased apoptosis and erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Taken together, our findings not only demonstrate that Bcr-Abl inhibitor-mediated apoptosis and differentiation are fully distinguishable events, but also that caspases are dispensable for erythroid differentiation of established CML cell lines.","['Jacquel, A', 'Colosetti, P', 'Grosso, S', 'Belhacene, N', 'Puissant, A', 'Marchetti, S', 'Breittmayer, J-P', 'Auberger, P']","['Jacquel A', 'Colosetti P', 'Grosso S', 'Belhacene N', 'Puissant A', 'Marchetti S', 'Breittmayer JP', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM, U526, Cell Death Differentiation and Cancer Team, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (PD 166326)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/enzymology/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2006/10/18 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210034 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210034 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Apr 12;26(17):2445-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210034.

A cell-permeable peptide that mimics the leucine zipper subdomain of IKKgamma, thus preventing its oligomerization, inhibited the constitutive NF-kappaB activation and induced apoptotic cell death in a panel of human MDS and AML cell lines (P39, MOLM13, THP1 and MV4-11). Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit or the three IKK subunits including IKKgamma/NEMO also induced apoptotic cell death in P39 cells. Cell death induced by the IKKgamma/NEMO-antagonistic peptide involved the caspase-independent loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential as well as signs of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization with the consequent release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G. Primary bone marrow CD34(+) cells from high-risk MDS and AML patients also succumbed to the IKKgamma/NEMO-antagonistic peptide, but not to a mutated control peptide. Altogether, these data indicate that malignant cells in high-risk MDS and AML cells critically depend on IKKgamma/NEMO to survive. Moreover, our data delineate a novel procedure for their therapeutic removal, through inhibition of IKKgamma/NEMO oligomerization.","['Carvalho, G', 'Fabre, C', 'Braun, T', 'Grosjean, J', 'Ades, L', 'Agou, F', 'Tasdemir, E', 'Boehrer, S', 'Israel, A', 'Veron, M', 'Fenaux, P', 'Kroemer, G']","['Carvalho G', 'Fabre C', 'Braun T', 'Grosjean J', 'Ades L', 'Agou F', 'Tasdemir E', 'Boehrer S', 'Israel A', 'Veron M', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM, Unit Apoptosis, Cancer and Immunity, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (IKBKG protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Protein Subunits', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transfection']",2006/10/18 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210043 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210043 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Apr 5;26(16):2299-307. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210043.

The block to infection is early in the life cycle, at the poorly understood uncoating stage. We implicate the proteasome at uncoating by completely rescuing the resistant phenotype with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132. We further report on the complementation cloning of a gene (MRI, modulator of retrovirus infection) that can also act to reverse the inhibition of infection in the mutant cell line. These data implicate a role for the proteasome during uncoating, and they suggest that MRI is a regulator of this activity.

We demonstrate that mice deficient in the enzyme 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) develop a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) that progresses to transplantable leukemia. Although not associated with dysregulation of Abl, cells isolated from chronic stage 12/15-LO-deficient (Alox15) mice exhibit increased activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, the transcription factor interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is hyperphosphorylated and displays decreased nuclear accumulation, translating into increased levels of expression of the oncoprotein Bcl-2. The ICSBP defect, exaggerated levels of Bcl-2, and prolonged leukemic cell survival associated with chronic stage Alox15 MPD are all reversible upon treatment with a PI3-K inhibitor. Remarkably, the evolution of Alox15 MPD to leukemia is associated with additional regulation of ICSBP on an RNA level, highlighting the potential usefulness of the Alox15 model for understanding the transition of CML to crisis. Finally, 12/15-LO expression suppresses the growth of a human CML-derived cell line. These data identify 12/15-LO as an important suppressor of MPD via its role as a critical upstream effector in the regulation of PI3-K-dependent ICSBP phosphorylation.","['Middleton, Melissa Kristine', 'Zukas, Alicia Marie', 'Rubinstein, Tanya', 'Jacob, Michele', 'Zhu, Peijuan', 'Zhao, Liang', 'Blair, Ian', 'Pure, Ellen']","['Middleton MK', 'Zukas AM', 'Rubinstein T', 'Jacob M', 'Zhu P', 'Zhao L', 'Blair I', 'Pure E']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (12-15-lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.33 (Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology/genetics/*prevention & control']",2006/10/18 09:00,2006/12/13 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20061444 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20061444 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2006 Oct 30;203(11):2529-40. doi: 10.1084/jem.20061444.

The objective of this study was to investigate factors predisposing to the development of ML-DS. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 134 bone marrow specimens from 64 children with ML-DS and non-DS AML during chemotherapy and 7 specimens from DS children with- out leukemia,who did not receive any chemotherapy,The specimens were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis. RESULTS: Samples taken from children with ML-DS in complete remission during chemotherapy aberrantly expressed CD56 (NCAM) at the surface of monocytic and granulocytic cells. Compared to non-DS AML cases,children with ML-DS had a statistically significant higher proportion of CD56+ cells in the CD33+ fraction: 71%+/-6% vs. 4%+/-1% (p<0.00001). A significant decrease of the amount of CD33+/CD56+ cells was observed during and after maintenance therapy. An increased number of CD33+/CD56+ cells was also present (>85%) in children with DS who did not receive chemotherapy, but showed a left-shift (due to infection), compared with DS children without left-shift (<10% CD33+/CD56+ cells). Within the CD33+/CD56+ fraction, RUNX1 was overexpressed more than 5-fold (p<0.02) compared to CD33+/CD56- cells, whereas there were no differences regarding GATA1, SPI1, ERG or ETS-2 levels.

The risk factors for different severities of bleeding are poorly studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from Rebulla et al. were analyzed in an exploratory analysis using multivariate Cox regression analyses for time-to-first bleed with time-depend- ent covariates reflecting measures of clinical and laboratory variables on the previous day. The relationships of the variables with three bleeding categories were studied: mild bleeding (WHO grades 1 and 2) clinically significant (bleeding grades 2, 3 and 4) and severe (bleeding grades 3 and 4). RESULTS: Bleeding of any severity occurred in 149 (58.4%) of 255 patients. There were 743 days of bleeding over 7335 patient-days of observation. Risk factors for mild bleeding included increased body temperature and decreased platelet count; the risk was decreased with administration of antifungal medication or platelet transfusion on the previous day. Risk factors for clinically significant bleeding included grade 1 bleeding on the previous day, decreased platelet count and elevated body temperature. Decreased platelet count and mild bleeding on the previous day were risk factors for severe bleeding. Higher hemoglobin values were associated with a delay in the time-to-first clinically significant bleed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results support clinical guidelines for increasing the platelet transfusion threshold in the presence of fever and support the use of milder bleeding symptoms as an outcome in clinical trials. The suggestion that hemo- globin concentration maybe predictive of bleeding risk supports the hypothesis that this maybe a valuable intervention in anemic thrombocytopenic patients at high risk of bleeding.","['Webert, Kathryn', 'Cook, Richard J', 'Sigouin, Chris S', 'Rebulla, Paolo', 'Heddle, Nancy M']","['Webert K', 'Cook RJ', 'Sigouin CS', 'Rebulla P', 'Heddle NM']","['Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. webertk@mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Fever/epidemiology/therapy', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytopenia/epidemiology/*therapy']",2006/10/18 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['03906078_10417 [pii]'],ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Nov;91(11):1530-7.

Cumulative incidences (death from any cause being a competing event) were 5% and 11% for solid cancer and 1% and 3% for acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome at 10 and 15 years, respectively. Cancer risk appeared age-related: in young patients high risks were observed for leukemia (SIR 16.7,95% CI 1.4-93.1,AER 5.0), Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR 60.1,95% CI 12.4-175.2, AER 15.7), colorectal cancer (SIR 12.5, 95% CI 2.6-36.5, AER 14.7) and lung cancer (SIR 15.4; 95% CI 4.2-39.4, AER 19.8), while risk in patients older than 45 years matched than that in the normal population. The risk of cancer was significantly raised by smoking and salvage treatment. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Half of the patients die of aggressive NHL before living long enough to experience second cancer. Only young patients have a high risk of second cancer during follow-up beyond 10 years.","['Moser, Elizabeth C', 'Noordijk, Evert M', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E', 'Baars, Joke W', 'Thomas, Jose', 'Carde, Patrice', 'Meerwaldt, Jacobus H', 'van Glabbeke, Martine', 'Kluin-Nelemans, Hanneke C']","['Moser EC', 'Noordijk EM', 'van Leeuwen FE', 'Baars JW', 'Thomas J', 'Carde P', 'Meerwaldt JH', 'van Glabbeke M', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC']","['EORTC Data Centre, Brussels, Belgium. e.c.moser@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2006/10/18 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['03906078_10530 [pii]'],ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Nov;91(11):1481-8.

RESULTS: Here, we show that Dlg1 knockdown by RNA interference increases the ability of Tax1 to transform a mouse T-cell line (CTLL-2), as measured interleukin (IL)-2-independent growth. A Tax1 mutant defective for the Dlg1 interaction showed reduced transformation of CTLL-2 compared to wild type Tax1, but the transformation was minimally affected by Dlg1 reduction. The few Tax1DeltaC-transduced CTLL-2 cells that became transformed expressed less Dlg1 than parental cells, suggesting that Dlg1-low cells were selectively transformed by Tax1DeltaC. Moreover, all human T-cell lines immortalized by HTLV-1, including the recombinant HTLV-1-containing Tax1DeltaC, expressed less Dlg1 than control T-cell lines. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that inactivation of Dlg1 augments Tax1-mediated transformation of CTLL-2, and PDZ protein(s) other than Dlg1 are critically involved in the transformation.","['Ishioka, Kojiro', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Yoshida, Sakiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Takahashi, Sugata', 'Xie, Li', 'Green, Patrick L', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Ishioka K', 'Higuchi M', 'Takahashi M', 'Yoshida S', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Takahashi S', 'Xie L', 'Green PL', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata, Japan. kojiro1@med.niigata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein)', '0 (Dlg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (SAP90-PSD95 Associated Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/*physiology', '*Gene Silencing', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'SAP90-PSD95 Associated Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology']",2006/10/18 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2006/10/18 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-3-71 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-3-71 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2006 Oct 17;3:71. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-3-71.,20061017,,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA077556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1622753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the contrary, data from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are very limited, in particular, as the impact of an antecedent diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) on mobilization of PBSCs as well as hematopoietic recovery after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is concerned. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 150 consecutive AML patients in first complete remission in order to make a comparison between patients with de novo AML and secondary AML (s-AML) in terms of CD34 positive (CD34+) cells mobilization and number of leukapheresis needed to collect at least one single stem cell graft. Data concerning hematopoietic recovery after ASCT were also compared. The successful mobilization rate (>2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg) was comparable between de novo AML patients (87%) and those with s-AML (76%), P:0.21. No statistically significant difference was found in terms of either median number of CD34+ cells collected (P:0.44) or CD34+ cells peak in peripheral blood (P:0.28). Both groups of patients needed a median of two apheresis (P:0.45) and no difference was found on the median number of CD34+ cells collected per single apheresis (P:0.59).

We aimed at standardizing a simple, fast, and reproducible flow cytometry method. METHODS: AntiZAP-70 antibody 2F3.2 was used with indirect labeling and secondary anti-IgG2a antibody. The reference values for the expression of the results were determined on 45 normal blood samples. ZAP-70 protein expression was investigated in 192 CLL samples. The indirect technique was compared with FITC-conjugated 2F3.2 clone, and with clone 1E7.2-FITC, -PE or -AlexaFluor 488. RESULTS: Using FITC or PE-conjugated antibodies, 2F3.2 and 1E7.2 clones allowed a much less adequate discrimination between positive and negative cells and discordant cases were most likely true negative cases. Using the AlexaFluor 488 conjugated 1E7.2 clone, the discordant cases were mostly negative with the conjugated antibody and positive with the 2F3.2 clone but Western blotting or RNA microarray confirmed discordant cases were false negative with the conjugated antibody. Subsequently, recommendations were used by 13 centers participating in an interlaboratory quality control protocol. The use of MFI ratio appeared to be more reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested that slight differences in the procedure had little impact on the interpretation in characteristic cases; however, careful interpretation was required for values close to threshold.","['Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Ticchioni, Michel', 'Brissard, Martine', 'Salmon, Celine', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Bernard, Alain', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence', 'Letestu, Remi']","['Le Garff-Tavernier M', 'Ticchioni M', 'Brissard M', 'Salmon C', 'Raynaud S', 'Davi F', 'Bernard A', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Letestu R']","['Hematology Biology Department, CHU Pitie Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

RESULTS: In a total of 21,581 individual comparisons between signal intensities obtained by microarray analysis and percentages of positive cell as determined by flow cytometry, coefficients of correlation in the range of 0.171 to 0.807 were obtained. In particular, the degree of correlation was high in the following genes critical in the diagnostic setting: CD4, CD8, CD13 (ANPEP), CD33, CD23 (FCER2), CD64 (FCGR1A), CD117 (KIT), CD34, MPO, CD20 (MS4A1), CD7 (range of r, 0.589-0.807).

UEV1A encodes a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant, which is required for Ubc13 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme) catalyzed poly-ubiquitination of target proteins through Lys63-linked chains. One of the target proteins is NEMO/IKKgamma (nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator/inhibitor of kappaB protein kinase), a regulatory subunit of IkappaB kinase in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In this report, we show that constitutive high-level expression of UEV1A alone in cultured human cells was sufficient to cause a significant increase in NF-kappaB activity as well as the expression of its target anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2). Overexpression of UEV1A also conferred prolonged cell survival under serum-deprived conditions, and protected cells against apoptosis induced by diverse stressing agents. All of the effects of Uev1A were reversible upon suppression of UEV1 expression by RNA interference. Our observations presented in this report provide evidence that Uev1A is a critical regulatory component in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in response to environmental stresses and identify UEV1A as a potential proto-oncogene.","['Syed, Noor A', 'Andersen, Parker L', 'Warrington, Robert C', 'Xiao, Wei']","['Syed NA', 'Andersen PL', 'Warrington RC', 'Xiao W']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N-5E5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2V1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*metabolism']",2006/10/17 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-0197-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Dec;11(12):2147-57. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-0197-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date there has been no definitive research documenting metabolic changes in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. In order to investigate whether ALL cells have an altered metabolism, we initially compared the transcriptional profiles of 22 specimens from paediatric patients diagnosed with ALL to five CD34+ specimens isolated from bone marrow, which was verified in an independent cohort of 101 specimens. Profiling revealed the upregulation of genes facilitating glycolysis in the ALL specimens compared to the CD34+ specimens, while those involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were downregulated. Functional studies supported the microarray findings threefold: (1) higher expression of the glucose transport protein glucose transporter 1 in ALL compared to CD34+ specimens, (2) the excessive production of lactate in ALL cell lines and (3) sensitivity of ALL cell lines to the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose. While metabolic alterations have been well documented in solid tumours, this is the first study to provide direct evidence for the existence of metabolic changes in the leukaemic cells of ALL patients. The finding offers new options for targeted therapy for ALL patients.","['Boag, J M', 'Beesley, A H', 'Firth, M J', 'Freitas, J R', 'Ford, J', 'Hoffmann, K', 'Cummings, A J', 'de Klerk, N H', 'Kees, U R']","['Boag JM', 'Beesley AH', 'Firth MJ', 'Freitas JR', 'Ford J', 'Hoffmann K', 'Cummings AJ', 'de Klerk NH', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Citric Acid Cycle/genetics', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacokinetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucose/*pharmacokinetics', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/10/17 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404365 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404365 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Oct;20(10):1731-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404365.

We examined the transcriptome of preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in which PU.1 was knocked down (referred to as 'PU.1-knockdown HSCs') to identify transcriptional changes preceding malignant transformation. Transcription factors c-Jun and JunB were among the top-downregulated targets. Restoration of c-Jun expression in preleukemic cells rescued the PU.1 knockdown-initiated myelomonocytic differentiation block. Lentiviral restoration of JunB at the leukemic stage led to loss of leukemic self-renewal capacity and prevented leukemia in NOD-SCID mice into which leukemic PU.1-knockdown cells were transplanted. Examination of human individuals with AML confirmed the correlation between PU.1 and JunB downregulation. These results delineate a transcriptional pattern that precedes leukemic transformation in PU.1-knockdown HSCs and demonstrate that decreased levels of c-Jun and JunB contribute to the development of PU.1 knockdown-induced AML by blocking differentiation and increasing self-renewal. Therefore, examination of disturbed gene expression in HSCs can identify genes whose dysregulation is essential for leukemic stem cell function and that are targets for therapeutic interventions.","['Steidl, Ulrich', 'Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Verhaak, Roel G W', 'Gu, Xuesong', 'Ebralidze, Alexander', 'Otu, Hasan H', 'Klippel, Steffen', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Bruns, Ingmar', 'Costa, Daniel B', 'Wagner, Katharina', 'Aivado, Manuel', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'Libermann, Towia A', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Steidl U', 'Rosenbauer F', 'Verhaak RG', 'Gu X', 'Ebralidze A', 'Otu HH', 'Klippel S', 'Steidl C', 'Bruns I', 'Costa DB', 'Wagner K', 'Aivado M', 'Kobbe G', 'Valk PJ', 'Passegue E', 'Libermann TA', 'Delwel R', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/10/17 09:00,2007/01/19 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['ng1898 [pii]', '10.1038/ng1898 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2006 Nov;38(11):1269-77. doi: 10.1038/ng1898.

A specific diagnostic role for the bone marrow biopsy has not been adequately explored. We examined whether bone marrow biopsy supplemented by immunohistochemistry may be helpful in distinguishing CMML from cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). We immunostained 25 cases of CMML with paraffin reactive antibodies which included CD68 (KP1), CD68R (PG-M1), and CD163, and compared the results with those observed in six cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia and in three cases of atypical CML. In addition, we examined whether CD34 immunohistochemistry could be useful in separating cases of CMML with less than 10% blasts (type-1) from cases of CMML with blasts accounting for 10-19% (type-2), and cases of CMML in acute transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (blasts > or = 20%). The presence of nodules of plasmacytoid monocytes was investigated by CD123 staining. CD42b was used to highlight abnormal megakaryocytes. Our results demonstrate significant differences between the groups. CD34 analysis allowed separating CMML type-1 from type-2 and the former from CMML in acute transformation. CD123-positive plasmacytoid monocyte nodules were found only in CMML and not in the other two disease groups. Overlap between CMML and the other two groups were observed with CD68 immunostaining. CD68R was more restricted to bone marrow macrophages and monocytes than CD68, but the differences between CMML and chronic myelogenous leukemia or atypical CML were still not significant. Although CD42b immunostaining facilitated the detection of dwarf megakaryocytes often present in CMML, the distinction between those and the small forms seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia was still problematic.","['Orazi, Attilio', 'Chiu, Ronald', ""O'Malley, Dennis P"", 'Czader, Magdalena', 'Allen, Susan L', 'An, Caroline', 'Vance, Gail H']","['Orazi A', 'Chiu R', ""O'Malley DP"", 'Czader M', 'Allen SL', 'An C', 'Vance GH']","['Clarian Pathology Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5200, USA. aorazi@iupui.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged']",2006/10/17 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['3800707 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.3800707 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2006 Dec;19(12):1536-45. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800707.

We report MR imaging findings, clinical courses, and outcomes in eight patients with various diseases and conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients with a reversible SCC lesion with transiently restricted diffusion were reviewed retrospectively. Diseases and conditions that were associated with a reversible lesion included epilepsy receiving AED (n=1), seizure from eclampsia receiving AED (n=1), mild infectious encephalitis (n=2), hypernatremia resulting in osmotic myelinolysis (n=1), and neoplasm (n=3) such as acute lymphocytic leukemia, spinal meningeal melanocytoma, and esophageal cancer. We evaluated MR imaging findings and clinical findings. RESULTS: Seven patients had isolated SCC lesions; one patient with osmotic myelinolysis showed additional parenchymal lesions. The reversible SCC lesion shape was oval (n=6) or extended (n=2). The mean apparent diffusion coefficient value of the splenial lesion was 0.40+/-0.16 x 10-3 mm2/s, ranging from 0.22 to 0.64 x 10-3 mm2/s. In a patient with osmotic myelinolysis, additional white matter lesions, shown as restricted diffusion, were revealed as not reversible on follow-up MR imaging. Neurological courses and outcomes were good in seven patients with isolated SCC lesions, but poor in one with osmotic myelinolysis. CONCLUSION: Reversible SCC lesion with restricted diffusion is apparent in a wide spectrum of diseases and conditions. Neurological courses and outcomes are good, particularly in patients with isolated SCC lesions. Knowledge of MR imaging findings and the associated spectrum of diseases and conditions might prevent unnecessary invasive examinations and treatments.","['Maeda, M', 'Tsukahara, H', 'Terada, H', 'Nakaji, S', 'Nakamura, H', 'Oba, H', 'Igarashi, O', 'Arasaki, K', 'Machida, T', 'Takeda, K', 'Takanashi, J I']","['Maeda M', 'Tsukahara H', 'Terada H', 'Nakaji S', 'Nakamura H', 'Oba H', 'Igarashi O', 'Arasaki K', 'Machida T', 'Takeda K', 'Takanashi JI']","['Department of Radiology, Mie University School of Medicine, 174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan. mmaeda@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,J Neuroradiol,Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie,7705086,['0 (Anticonvulsants)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use', 'Corpus Callosum/*pathology', 'Encephalitis/complications/microbiology/*pathology', 'Epilepsy/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelinolysis, Central Pontine/complications/*pathology', 'Neoplasms/complications/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/10/17 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['MDOI-JNR-10-2006-33-4-0150-9861-101019-200604931 [pii]', '10.1016/s0150-9861(06)77268-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroradiol. 2006 Oct;33(4):229-36. doi: 10.1016/s0150-9861(06)77268-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal gammopathies can occur in RA. Their predictive value for the development of a lymphoproliferative disorder remains unclear and disputed. We reviewed charts of 214 RA patients all of whom had at least one serum protein electrophoresis. We performed a retrospective study of 12 patients with RA and an M spike. We further characterized the M spike by serum immunofixation and bone marrow studies. The median age at which the M spike was identified was 69 years. IgG was the predominant gammopathy in 50% of patients, with no difference in the amount of kappa (kappa) and lambda (lambda) chains. One patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, one with an undefined primary lymphoproliferative disorder, one with T-cell leukemia, five with myelodysplastic syndrome, and four with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance at most recent evaluation. Of our patients, 42% had a myelodysplastic syndrome, which has not been previously reported, and, in contrast to previous reports, no lymphomas were identified. The follow-up evaluation of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is important because they may progress to an overt neoplasia.","['Toro-Jimenez, Luis A', 'Caceres, William', 'Mejias, Edwin']","['Toro-Jimenez LA', 'Caceres W', 'Mejias E']","['San Juan Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00921, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Rheumatol,Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,9518034,,,,2006/10/17 09:00,2006/10/17 09:01,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/17 09:01 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['00124743-200210000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/00124743-200210000-00001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Rheumatol. 2002 Oct;8(5):243-6. doi: 10.1097/00124743-200210000-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed at exploring this association for specific disease lymphohematopoietic entities in a large Norwegian cohort. Height and weight were measured in two million Norwegian men and women aged 20-74 years during 1963-2001. During follow-up, 24,500 cases of LHMs were observed. Relative risks of disease were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. The risk of LHMs overall increased moderately by increasing body mass index and height in both sexes. The relative risk of LHMs per five-unit increase in body mass index was 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.14) in men and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.11) in women. For each 10-cm increase in height, the relative risk was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.22) in men and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.20) in women. Separate analyses for different lymphohematopoietic malignancies did not reveal any group's being particularly strongly associated with body mass index. A modest increase in the risk of LHMs combined was observed with increasing height. The moderate associations between height and body mass index and LHMs found in the present study indicate that the observed increase in overweight/obesity plays only a minor role in explaining the increase in the incidence of LHMs.","['Engeland, Anders', 'Tretli, Steinar', 'Hansen, Svein', 'Bjorge, Tone']","['Engeland A', 'Tretli S', 'Hansen S', 'Bjorge T']","['Division of Epidemiology, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway. anders.engeland@isf.uib.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Body Height', '*Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Obesity/complications/epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2006/10/17 09:00,2007/02/16 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwj353 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwj353 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2007 Jan 1;165(1):44-52. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwj353.

Thymidine uptake studies showed that sunitinib was active against EOL-1, MV4-11, and Kasumi-1 cells, which possessed activating mutations of the PDGFRalpha, FLT-3, and c-KIT genes, respectively, with IC(50)s of <30 nmol/L. In addition, sunitinib inhibited the proliferation of freshly isolated leukemia cells from patients possessing mutations in FLT3 gene. Annexin V staining showed that sunitinib induced apoptosis of these cells. Sunitinib inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 and PDGFRalpha in conjunction with blockade of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in MV4-11 and EOL-1 cells, respectively. Interestingly, rapamycin analogue RAD001 enhanced the ability of sunitinib to inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells and down-regulate levels of mammalian target of rapamycin effectors p70 S6 kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 in these cells. Taken together, sunitinib may be useful for treatment of individuals with leukemias possessing activation mutation of tyrosine kinase, and the combination of sunitinib and RAD001 represents a promising novel treatment strategy.","['Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Tasaka, Taizo', 'Yang, Yang', 'Komatsu, Naoki', 'Togitani, Kazuto', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Taguchi, Hirokuni']","['Ikezoe T', 'Nishioka C', 'Tasaka T', 'Yang Y', 'Komatsu N', 'Togitani K', 'Koeffler HP', 'Taguchi H']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan. ikezoet@med.kochi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Everolimus', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Sunitinib', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2006/10/17 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/10/2522 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0071 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Oct;5(10):2522-30. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The realization of this potential requires the development of new, rapid, high-throughput technologies for performing protein arrays on patient samples, as well as novel analytic techniques to interpret them. Herein, we describe the validation and robustness of using reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) for the analysis of primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples as well as leukemic and normal stem cells. In this report, we show that array printing, detection, amplification, and staining precision are very high, reproducible, and that they correlate with traditional Western blotting. Using replicates of the same sample on the same and/or separate arrays, or using separate protein samples prepared from the same starting sample, the intra- and interarray reproducibility was extremely high. No statistically significant difference in protein signal intensities could be detected within the array setups. The activation status (phosphorylation) was maintained in experiments testing delayed processing and preparation from multiple freeze-thawed samples. Differences in protein expression could reliably be detected in as few as three cell protein equivalents. RPPA prepared from rare populations of normal and leukemic stem cells were successfully done and showed differences from bulk populations of cells. Examples show how RPPAs are ideally suited for the large-scale analysis of target identification, validation, and drug discovery. In summary, RPPA is a highly reliable, reproducible, high-throughput system that allows for the rapid large-scale proteomic analysis of protein expression and phosphorylation state in primary acute myelogenous leukemia cells, cell lines, and in human stem cells.","['Tibes, Raoul', 'Qiu, Yihua', 'Lu, Yiling', 'Hennessy, Bryan', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Kornblau, Steven M']","['Tibes R', 'Qiu Y', 'Lu Y', 'Hennessy B', 'Andreeff M', 'Mills GB', 'Kornblau SM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/10/17 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/10/2512 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0334 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Oct;5(10):2512-21. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0334.,,,['P01 CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of an excess of thymidine (125:1, mol:mol), in the cell suspension with or without zidovudine fully restored the protein kinase C activity. Interestingly, either in cell homogenates and in commercially purified rat brain protein kinase C, both zidovudine and its monophosphate derivative, caused inhibition that was higher than in intact cells. This inhibition reached a maximal value of 45% when zidovudine or zidovudine monophosphate were incubated with the pure commercial enzyme and in this case the addition of thymidine did not prevent the enzyme inhibition. The conclusions from these data are that either zidovudine or zidovudine monophosphate interact directly with the pure enzyme, causing inhibition, while in intact cells exposed to the drug, zidovudine monophosphate appears to be the main metabolite responsible for protein kinase C inhibition.","['Carnicelli, Veronica', 'Di Giulio, Antonio', 'Bozzi, Argante', 'Strom, Roberto', 'Oratore, Arduino']","['Carnicelli V', 'Di Giulio A', 'Bozzi A', 'Strom R', 'Oratore A']","[""Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technology, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",2006/10/17 09:00,2007/02/16 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTOpto_486 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.pto_486.x [doi]']",ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2006 Oct;99(4):317-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.pto_486.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples of MD vaccines manufactured by two companies (A and B) were received from a breeder company; samples were also received directly from vaccine company B. Using virus isolation tests, samples initially tested positive for subgroup E (endogenous) ALV. However, upon repassage, the vaccines also tested positive for exogenous ALV. The isolated exogenous ALV proved to be a subgroup A virus, as determined by flow cytometry using polyclonal chicken antibodies specific for various subgroups of ALV, and by DNA sequencing of the envelope glygoprotein (gp85). The exogenous ALV isolated from MD vaccines was inoculated in chickens from ADOL lines 15I(5) x 7(1) and 0 to determine its pathogenicity and compare it with that of Rous-associated-virus-1 (RAV-1), the prototype strain of ALV-A. Each chicken from each line was inoculated with approximately 10,000 infectious units of RAV-1 or the ALV-A isolated from vaccines termed B-39 virus at 7th day of embryonation. At hatch, and at 4, 8, and 16 wk of age, chickens were tested for viremia and cloacal shedding; chickens were also observed for ALV-induced tumors within 16 wk of age. Viremia and cloacal shedding results suggest that chickens from both lines were susceptible to infection with either virus. Within 16 wk of age, the proportion of ALV tumors induced by strain B-39 in line 0 and line 15I5 x 7(1) chickens was 0% and 12%, respectively, compared with 62% and 67% in chickens inoculated with RAV-1. The data indicate that commercial MD vaccines produced by two manufacturers were contaminated with endogenous subgroup E and an exogenous subgroup A ALV. Further, data from biological characterization suggest that the ALV-A isolated from commercial MD vaccines is of low oncogenicity, compared with that of RAV-1.

Additional groups of chickens from the same seven parental lines were inoculated with ALV-B. Chickens were tested for ALV viremia and antibody at 0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 wk postinfection. Chickens from all parental lines studied were susceptible to infection with ALV-B with 40%-100% of inoculated chickens positive for ALV at hatch following embryo infection. Similarly, infection of egg layer flocks with the ALV-B/J recombinant virus at 8 days of embryonation induced tolerance to ALV with 86%-100% of the chickens viremic, 40%-75% of the chickens shedding virus, and only 2/125 (2%) of the chickens producing serum-neutralizing antibodies against homologous ALV-B/J recombinant virus at 32 wk postinfection. In contrast, when infected with the ALV-B/J recombinant virus at hatch, 33%-82% of the chickens were viremic, 28%-47% shed virus, and 0%-56% produced serum-neutralizing antibodies against homologous ALV-B/J recombinant virus at 32 wk postinfection. Infection with the ALV-B/J recombinant virus at embryonation and at hatch induced predominately lymphoid leukosis (LL), along with other common ALV neoplasms, including erythroblastosis, osteopetrosis, nephroblastomas, and rhabdosarcomas. No incidence of myeloid leukosis (ML) was observed in any of the commercial White Leghorn egg layer flocks infected with ALV-B/J in the present study. Data suggest that the parental line of commercial layers may influence development of ALV-B/J-induced viremia and antibody, but not tumor type. Differences in type of tumors noted in the present study and those noted in the field case where the ALV-B/J was first isolated may be attributed to differences in the genetics of the commercial layer flock in which ML was first diagnosed and the present commercial layer flocks tested in the present study.","['Mays, Jody K', 'Pandiri, Arun R', 'Fadly, Aly M']","['Mays JK', 'Pandiri AR', 'Fadly AM']","['U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, 3606 East Mount Hope Road, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Chickens/*virology', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Neoplasms/genetics/veterinary/virology', 'Reassortant Viruses/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Viremia', 'Virus Shedding']",2006/10/17 09:00,2006/11/11 09:00,['2006/10/17 09:00'],"['2006/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1637/7493-121505R.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Dis. 2006 Sep;50(3):342-7. doi: 10.1637/7493-121505R.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent advances, most therapeutic approaches fail to eradicate the entire neoplastic clone. The remaining cells often develop metastasis and/or recurrences and therefore may represent attractive targets of therapy. A new exciting concept in this regard suggests that each neoplasm represents a heterogeneous population of cells that pertain to long-term tumor growth both in vivo in the natural host and in experimental animals. This concept postulates the existence of small fractions of 'tumor stem cells' that exhibit a capacity for self-renewal and unlimited growth and therefore are distinct from their progeny. Based on these hypotheses, the targeting of neoplastic stem cells is considered indispensable for eradication of the entire clone and for the development of curative treatment approaches. However, tumor stem cells often may be quiescent cells and may express a different profile of targets compared with 'more mature' tumor cells. Therefore, current efforts have attempted to characterize target expression profiles in cancer stem cells in various malignancies.

To further address the clinical, immunophenotypical and molecular genetic findings of this chromosomal aberration, we studied 330 additional T-ALLs. This revealed TCRbeta-HOXA rearrangements in five additional patients, which brings the total to 14 cases in 424 patients (3.3%). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis for HOXA10 gene expression was performed in 170 T-ALL patients and detected HOXA10 overexpression in 25.2% of cases including all the cases with a TCRbeta-HOXA rearrangement (8.2%). In contrast, expression of the short HOXA10 transcript, HOXA10b, was almost exclusively found in the TCRbeta-HOXA rearranged cases, suggesting a specific role for the HOXA10b short transcript in TCRbeta-HOXA-mediated oncogenesis. Other molecular and/or cytogenetic aberrations frequently found in subtypes of T-ALL (SIL-TAL1, CALM-AF10, HOX11, HOX11L2) were not detected in the TCRbeta-HOXA rearranged cases except for deletion 9p21 and NOTCH1 activating mutations, which were present in 64 and 67%, respectively. In conclusion, this study defines TCRbeta-HOXA rearranged T-ALLs as a distinct cytogenetic subgroup by clinical, immunophenotypical and molecular genetic characteristics.","['Cauwelier, B', 'Cave, H', 'Gervais, C', 'Lessard, M', 'Barin, C', 'Perot, C', 'Van den Akker, J', 'Mugneret, F', 'Charrin, C', 'Pages, M P', 'Gregoire, M-J', 'Jonveaux, P', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, M', 'Mozzicconacci, M J', 'Terre, C', 'Luquet, I', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, P', 'Laurence, B', 'Plessis, G', 'Lefebvre, C', 'Leroux, D', 'Antoine-Poirel, H', 'Graux, C', 'Mauvieux, L', 'Heimann, P', 'Chalas, C', 'Clappier, E', 'Verhasselt, B', 'Benoit, Y', 'Moerloose, B D', 'Poppe, B', 'Van Roy, N', 'Keersmaecker, K D', 'Cools, J', 'Sigaux, F', 'Soulier, J', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Paepe, A D', 'Dastugue, N', 'Berger, R', 'Speleman, F']","['Cauwelier B', 'Cave H', 'Gervais C', 'Lessard M', 'Barin C', 'Perot C', 'Van den Akker J', 'Mugneret F', 'Charrin C', 'Pages MP', 'Gregoire MJ', 'Jonveaux P', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Mozzicconacci MJ', 'Terre C', 'Luquet I', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Laurence B', 'Plessis G', 'Lefebvre C', 'Leroux D', 'Antoine-Poirel H', 'Graux C', 'Mauvieux L', 'Heimann P', 'Chalas C', 'Clappier E', 'Verhasselt B', 'Benoit Y', 'Moerloose BD', 'Poppe B', 'Van Roy N', 'Keersmaecker KD', 'Cools J', 'Sigaux F', 'Soulier J', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Paepe AD', 'Dastugue N', 'Berger R', 'Speleman F']","['Centre for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404410 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404410 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):121-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404410.

We therefore tested the chimeric anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), KM2760, the Fc region of which is defucosylated to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), as a novel immunotherapy for refractory HL. KM2760 demonstrated a promising antitumor activity in the CCR4-positive HL-bearing mouse model in the therapeutic setting. Although KM2760 did not induce any ADCC mediated by mouse natural killer (NK) cells, it significantly enhanced phagocytosis mediated by mouse monocytes/macrophages against the CCR4-positive HL cell line in vitro. Together with the findings that KM2760 did not exhibit any complement-dependent cytotoxicity or direct antiproliferation activity in vitro, these data indicated that KM2760 exerted its robust in vivo antitumor activity via monocytes/macrophages in mice. In the human system, KM2760 enhanced phagocytic activity mediated by monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, it induced robust ADCC mediated by NK cells against the CCR4-positive HL cell line in vitro. Thus, it is conceivable that KM2760 would have much more potent antitumor activity in humans than in mice. Collectively, this study strongly indicates that anti-CCR4 mAb could be a novel treatment modality for patients with CCR4-positive HL.","['Ishida, T', 'Ishii, T', 'Inagaki, A', 'Yano, H', 'Kusumoto, S', 'Ri, M', 'Komatsu, H', 'Iida, S', 'Inagaki, H', 'Ueda, R']","['Ishida T', 'Ishii T', 'Inagaki A', 'Yano H', 'Kusumoto S', 'Ri M', 'Komatsu H', 'Iida S', 'Inagaki H', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine & Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Mizuho-chou, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan. itakashi@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Ccr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phagocytosis', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/chemistry']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404415 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404415 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2162-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404415.

We have evaluated the impact of an intensified post-remission therapy using a high-dose chemotherapy course followed by allogeneic or autologous SCT on the outcome of 58 patients with t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 (E2A group, n=24) or t(4;11)/MLL-AF4 (MLL group, n=34) treated in the LALA-94 multicenter prospective study. Patients in the MLL group had higher WBC counts and more frequent DIC. CR rates achieved by MLL and E2A groups were similar to other B-cell ALL (87, 82 and 86% respectively). While in CR, patients with a donor were assigned to alloSCT (n=22), the remaining patients with were randomized between autoSCT (n=15) or chemotherapy (n=8). Five-year overall survival was 31 and 45% for E2A and MLL groups, respectively. In both groups, DFS was higher in the alloSCT arm as compared to autoSCT and chemotherapy arms. The results of this study show that chemotherapy intensification did not overcome the poor prognosis of adults with t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1.

Here, using human leukemia cells, which could be transplanted to immunodeficient mice, we studied the in vivo homing, proliferation and survival sites by immunohistopathology, compared with the corresponding sites for cord blood CD34(+) (CBCD34(+)) cells. The human leukemia cells initially localized on the surface of osteoblasts in the epiphysial region, and expanded to the inner vascular and diaphysial regions within 4 weeks. The percentage of CD34(+) leukemia cells in the bone marrow was transiently increased up to 50%. In vivo 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling revealed that the epiphysis was the most active site for leukemia cell proliferation. CBCD34(+) cells showed the similar pattern of homing and proliferation to leukemia cells. After high-dose administration of cytosine-1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside, residual leukemia cells were localized in the perivascular endothelium as well as in contact with the trabecular endosteum.

An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1), encoded by ABCB1 (MDR1) gene, is involved in the protection against xenobiotics and multi-drug resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential involvement of the ABCB1 gene exon 26 3435C>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the genetic susceptibility to AML and regulation of P-gp expression and activity in AML cells. A total of 180 adult AML patients and 180 sex-matched controls were genotyped using PCR-RFLP method. Moreover, in 40 AML patients ABCB1 gene expression was studied by real-time RT-PCR and P-gp expression and activity were assessed by flow cytometry assays. The prevalence of 3435C>T ABCB1 polymorphism was similar in patient and control cohorts (P = 0.16). Furthermore, the carriers of different ABCB1 genotypes did not differ significantly according to ABCB1 gene expression (P = 0.99), P-gp expression (P = 0.42) and P-gp activity (P = 0.83) in leukemic cells. The authors conclude that isolated 3435C>T ABCB1 SNP is not a major factor of the genetic susceptibility to adult AML, and that genotyping of this polymorphism does not allow predicting P-gp expression or activity in AML cells.","['Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Balcerczak, Ewa', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Janus, Agnieszka', 'Mirowski, Marek', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Jamroziak K', 'Balcerczak E', 'Cebula B', 'Janus A', 'Mirowski M', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organic Anion Transporters/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.ftd.0000245770.75097.3f [doi]', '00007691-200610000-00024 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2006 Oct;28(5):707-11. doi: 10.1097/01.ftd.0000245770.75097.3f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viruses form intranuclear viral inclusions in infected oligodendrocytes. The outer capsid of JCV is thought to be composed of 360 molecules of major capsid protein VP1, and minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 in an appropriate ratio. However, the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression for the capsid proteins, their nuclear transport, and formation of viral inclusions are not well understood. We have recently clarified the following regarding the mechanism underlying JCV virion assembly; (i) major and minor capsid proteins are synthesized from messenger RNAs, the expression ratio of which is determined by alternative splicing, (ii) messenger RNAs for the major and minor capsid proteins are polycistronic, and their translation occurs downstream of the regulatory protein, agnoprotein, (iii) major and minor capsid proteins are translocated to the nucleus in a cooperative manner and accumulate at the dot-shaped intranuclear structures called promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), (iv) efficient viral replication can occur at the PML-NBs, where capsid assembly is likely to be associated with viral DNA replication. PML-NBs are the sites for expression of important nuclear functions for the host cells. The finding that the target of JCV infection is the PML-NB may contribute greatly to our understanding of the mechanism underlying cellular degeneration, which occurs after the formation of intranuclear viral inclusions.","['Shishido-Hara, Yukiko']",['Shishido-Hara Y'],"['Department of Pathology, Kyorin University School of Medicine, 6-20-2, Shinkawa, Mitaka, Tokyo, 181-18611, Japan. yhara@kyorin-u.ac.jp']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Uirusu,Uirusu,0417475,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Capsid Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'JC Virus/metabolism/*pathogenicity/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/virology', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jsv/56.17 [pii]', '10.2222/jsv.56.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Uirusu. 2006 Jun;56(1):17-25. doi: 10.2222/jsv.56.17.,,,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most specific detection methods for serum antibodies use live virus in neutralization assays or in blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assays.

We report two new assays for detection of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus neutralizing antibody responses, based on virus pseudotypes. The first provides detection by marker gene expression after 20 hours and is particularly suited for high-throughput screening; the second uses a new, rapid virus entry assay to give readouts within 1 hour.

We predict CRMs for mammalian genes expressed in red blood cells by combining two properties gleaned from aligned, noncoding genome sequences: a positive regulatory potential (RP) score, which detects similarity to patterns in alignments distinctive for regulatory regions, and conservation of a binding site motif for the essential erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. Within eight target loci, we tested 75 noncoding segments by reporter gene assays in transiently transfected human K562 cells and/or after site-directed integration into murine erythroleukemia cells. Segments with a high RP score and a conserved exact match to the binding site consensus are validated at a good rate (50%-100%, with rates increasing at higher RP), whereas segments with lower RP scores or nonconsensus binding motifs tend to be inactive. Active DNA segments were shown to be occupied by GATA-1 protein by chromatin immunoprecipitation, whereas sites predicted to be inactive were not occupied. We verify four previously known erythroid CRMs and identify 28 novel ones.

In this study, we asked how glucocorticoids (GC), the physiological negative regulators of POMC gene expression, modulate this synergism. In the corticotroph cell line AtT-20, the response of the wild-type promoter to LIF+CRH was barely inhibited by GC, whereas a distal promoter subregion (-414/-293) encompassing the Nur response element-STAT site and devoid of the negative GC-responsive element located in the proximal domain, displayed a cooperative response to LIF+dexamethasone (DEX) and LIF+CRH+DEX treatments. LIF+CRH-stimulated ACTH secretion was also inefficiently inhibited by DEX in the same cell line. This study was focused thereafter on LIF+DEX cooperativity, which may be responsible, on the wild-type promoter, for lack of negative regulation by DEX of the LIF+CRH synergy. The STAT1-3 low-affinity site, in the context of the (-414/-293) subregion of the POMC promoter, was found necessary and sufficient for transcriptional synergism between activated GC receptor (GR) and STAT1-3. Moreover the activities of reporters specific for STAT1-3 or GR were reciprocally enhanced by DEX or LIF. Single and sequential chromatin immunoprecipitations revealed 1) a STAT-dependent corecruitment of coactivators after LIF and LIF+DEX stimulation and 2) a more lasting recruitment of both STAT3 and GR in the same enhanceosome on the endogenous POMC promoter after LIF+DEX joint stimulation than after the single one. Such events may be responsible for a lack of repressive property of GR unmasked on the whole POMC promoter during LIF+CRH stimulation and may contribute to the tonicity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during inflammatory-infectious diseases.","['Latchoumanin, Olivier', 'Mynard, Vanessa', 'Devin-Leclerc, Jocelyne', 'Dugue, Marie-Annick', 'Bertagna, Xavier', 'Catelli, Maria Grazia']","['Latchoumanin O', 'Mynard V', 'Devin-Leclerc J', 'Dugue MA', 'Bertagna X', 'Catelli MG']","[""Departement d'Endocrinologie, Metabolisme et Cancer, Institut Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects/physiology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/cytology/physiology', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/02/14 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2006-0460 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2006-0460 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2007 Jan;148(1):422-32. doi: 10.1210/en.2006-0460.

Studies conducted with constitutively active Stat5 mutants (Stat51*6 and cS5F) have shown that deregulated Stat5 activity promotes leukemogenesis. To investigate the oncogenic properties of these mutants, we used cS5F-expressing bone marrow cells which induce a multilineage leukemia when transplanted into recipient mice. Here, we show by immunocytochemistry that cS5F is localized mainly in the cytoplasmic compartment of leukemic cells, suggesting that the transforming nature of cS5F may be associated with a cytoplasmic function. In support of this hypothesis, we found that cS5F forms a complex with the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and the scaffolding adapter Gab2 in leukemic bone marrow cells, resulting in the activation of Akt/PKB, a crucial downstream target of PI3-K. By using transducible TAT-Gab2 or TAT-Akt recombinant proteins, we were able to demonstrate that activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway by cS5F molecules through Gab2 is essential for induction of cell growth. We also found that persistently phosphorylated Stat5 in primary cells from patients with myeloid leukemias has a cytoplasmic localization. These data suggest that oncogenic Stat5 proteins exert dual transforming capabilities not only as transcriptional activators but also as cytoplasmic signaling effectors.","['Harir, Noria', 'Pecquet, Christian', 'Kerenyi, Marc', 'Sonneck, Karoline', 'Kovacic, Boris', 'Nyga, Remy', 'Brevet, Marie', 'Dhennin, Isabelle', 'Gouilleux-Gruart, Valerie', 'Beug, Hartmut', 'Valent, Peter', 'Lassoued, Kaiss', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Gouilleux, Fabrice']","['Harir N', 'Pecquet C', 'Kerenyi M', 'Sonneck K', 'Kovacic B', 'Nyga R', 'Brevet M', 'Dhennin I', 'Gouilleux-Gruart V', 'Beug H', 'Valent P', 'Lassoued K', 'Moriggl R', 'Gouilleux F']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (EMI 351), Amiens, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42012-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-01-029918 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 15;109(4):1678-86. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-01-029918.

To what extent these cells possess the purported antiapoptotic phenotype of peripheral B-CLL cells is unknown. Recently, we have described that, in B-CLL samples from peripheral blood, aberrant apoptosis gene expression was not limited to protective changes but also included increased levels of proapoptotic BH3-only member Noxa. Here, we compare apoptosis gene profiles from peripheral blood B-CLL (n=15) with lymph node B-CLL (>90% CD5+/CD19+/CD23+ lymphocytes with Ki67+ centers; n=9). Apart from expected differences in Survivin and Bcl-xL, a prominent distinction with peripheral B-CLL cells was the decreased averaged level of Noxa in lymph nodes. Mcl-1 protein expression showed a reverse trend. Noxa expression could be reduced also in vitro by CD40 stimulation of peripheral blood B-CLL. Direct manipulation of Noxa protein levels was achieved by proteasome inhibition in B-CLL and via RNAi in model cell lines. In each instance, cell viability was directly linked with Noxa levels. These data indicate that suppression of Noxa in the lymph node environment contributes to the persistence of B-CLL at these sites and suggest that therapeutic targeting of Noxa might be beneficial.","['Smit, Laura A', 'Hallaert, Delfine Y H', 'Spijker, Rene', 'de Goeij, Bart', 'Jaspers, Annelieke', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'van Noesel, Carel J M', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Smit LA', 'Hallaert DY', 'Spijker R', 'de Goeij B', 'Jaspers A', 'Kater AP', 'van Oers MH', 'van Noesel CJ', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42010-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-021683 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 15;109(4):1660-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-021683.

Ninety-nine of 259 patients entered CR. Fifty-three of the 99 were seen by the Transplant Service with the remainder not seen because of illness, lack/unavailability of siblings, refusal, or, primarily, unclear reasons (21 patients). A donor was identified for 26 patients (21 sibling, 5 unrelated) with RIC-HSCT performed in 14 (13 sibling). Results in consulted patients suggested that 50% or fewer of the 85 patients who did not undergo transplantation were potential transplant candidates. We attempted to find one or more chemotherapy pair-mates for each patient who underwent transplantation based on cytogenetics, age, and a relapse-free survival (RFS) time that was more than or equal to the time from CR1 to RIC-HSCT in the patient who underwent transplantation. Thirty-two of the 39 matches favored (longer RFS) RIC-HSCT and 7, chemotherapy. The probability that the corresponding beta distribution was different than expected (ie, that RIC-HSCT was superior) was 0.99 (P=.004). Results were similar with respect to survival.

This protein tyrosine kinase is a key mediator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and is structurally homologous to Syk, which plays an analogous role in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Recent studies indicate that ZAP-70 may participate in BCR signaling as well, but the mechanism of action is not completely understood. We have now compared antigen receptor-induced activation of ZAP-70 in B cells and T cells by analyzing phosphorylation of critical regulatory tyrosine residues. We show that BCR-mediated activation of ZAP-70 is very inefficient in CLL and lymphoma B cells and is negligible when compared to activation of Syk. Despite the inefficient catalytic activation, the ability of ZAP-70 to recruit downstream signaling molecules in response to antigen receptor stimulation appeared relatively preserved. Moreover, ectopic expression of ZAP-70 enhanced and prolonged activation of several key mediators of BCR signaling, such as the Syk, ERK, and Akt kinases, and decreased the rate of ligand-mediated BCR internalization. We conclude that the role of ZAP-70 in BCR signaling is quite distinct from its role in TCR signaling and is likely mediated by inhibition of events that terminate the signaling response.","['Gobessi, Stefania', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Longo, Pablo G', 'Sica, Simona', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Gobessi S', 'Laurenti L', 'Longo PG', 'Sica S', 'Leone G', 'Efremov DG']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) Outstation-Monterotondo, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) Campus Adriano Buzzati-Traverso, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (CBLB protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', '*Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41928-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-03-011759 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):2032-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-011759.

In contrast to all known mechanisms that mediate alternative splicing in retroviruses, we found that in murine leukemia virus, distinct elements located upstream of the 5' splice site either inhibited or activated splicing of the genomic RNA. Detailed analysis of the first untranslated exon showed that the primer binding site (PBS) activates splicing, whereas flanking sequences either downstream or upstream of the PBS are inhibitory. This new function of the PBS was independent of its orientation and primer binding but associated with a particular destabilizing role in a proposed secondary structure. On the contrary, all sequences surrounding the PBS that are involved in stem formation of the first exon were found to suppress splicing. Targeted mutations that destabilized the central stem and compensatory mutations of the counter strand clearly validated the concept that murine leukemia virus attenuates its 5' splice site by forming an inhibitory stem-loop in its first exon. Importantly, this mode of splice regulation was conserved in a complete proviral clone. Some of the mutants that increase splicing revealed an opposite effect on translation, implying that the first exon also regulates this process. Together, these findings suggest that sequences upstream of the 5' splice site play an important role in splice regulation of simple retroviruses, directly or indirectly attenuating the efficiency of splicing.","['Kraunus, Janine', 'Zychlinski, Daniela', 'Heise, Tilman', 'Galla, Melanie', 'Bohne, Jens', 'Baum, Christopher']","['Kraunus J', 'Zychlinski D', 'Heise T', 'Galla M', 'Bohne J', 'Baum C']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", '*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion']",2006/10/14 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/10/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)71912-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M601537200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 8;281(49):37381-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M601537200.

There were 44 males and 29 females with a median age of 54 years (range 20-77). Overall, 16 out of 73 autografted patients (22%) had FLT3 mutations. More in detail, FLT3/ITDs were detected in 10 out of 73 patients (14%), while FLT3 D835 mutations were detected in five cases (7%). One patient (1%) was found as having both abnormalities. White blood cell count (p=0.009), serum concentration of lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.01), and percentages of peripheral blood (p=0.002) and bone marrow blasts (p=0.03) were significantly higher in patients showing the FLT3 mutations. On the contrary, overall survival and disease-free survival were similar between patients with or without FLT3 mutations (p=0.73 and 0.78, respectively). In conclusion, our data suggest that myeloablative chemotherapy supported by auto-PBSCT may overcome the adverse prognostic implications of FLT3 mutations in AML. However, it is to consider that autografted patients are highly selected for best response to induction, consolidation and mobilization, as well as for minor non-haematologic toxicity.","['Palmieri, Salvatore', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Leoni, Franco', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Pollio, Filiberto', ""D'Amico, Maria Rosaria"", 'Celentano, Maria', 'Viola, Assunta', 'Vicari, Laura', 'Izzo, Barbara', 'Pane, Fabrizio']","['Palmieri S', 'Ferrara F', 'Leoni F', 'Ciolli S', 'Pollio F', ""D'Amico MR"", 'Celentano M', 'Viola A', 'Vicari L', 'Izzo B', 'Pane F']","['Division of Haematology and Stem cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy. salpalmieri@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2006/10/13 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.794 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2007 Mar;25(1):1-5. doi: 10.1002/hon.794.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDT with the endogenous photosensitizer, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) induced by 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or its derivatives is a modification of this treatment modality with successful application in dermatology. However, the mechanism of cell destruction by ALA-PDT has not been elucidated. In this study a human T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cell line was treated with PDT using hexaminolevulinate (HAL, hexylester of ALA). Four hours following treatment nearly 80% of the cells exhibited typical apoptotic features. Mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins were evaluated by Western blots in subcellular fractionated samples. PDT caused cytosolic translocation of cytochrome c and nuclear redistribution of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), but the release of mitochondrial Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2 and EndoG was not observed. The release of cytochrome c was followed by the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 as well as its downstream substrates, together with oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The pan-caspases inhibitor, z-VAD.fmk, prevented oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, but failed to inhibit PDT-mediated apoptosis. The apoptotic induction by AIF-mediated caspase-independent pathway was also found after HAL-PDT with large-scale DNA fragmentation in the presence of z-VAD.fmk. These results demonstrate that cytochrome c-mediated caspase-dependent pathway and AIF-induced caspase-independent pathway are simultaneously involved in the apoptotic induction by PDT. When the cytochrome c-induced caspase-dependent pathway is blocked, the cells go into apoptosis via AIF-mediated pathway, clearly demonstrating that the cytochrome c-mediated caspase-dependent pathway is not required for such apoptotic induction. This finding may have an impact on improved PDT effectiveness.","['Furre, Ingegerd Eggen', 'Moller, Michael T N', 'Shahzidi, Susan', 'Nesland, Jahn M', 'Peng, Qian']","['Furre IE', 'Moller MT', 'Shahzidi S', 'Nesland JM', 'Peng Q']","['Pathology Clinic, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet HF Medical Center, Faculty Division Radiumhospitalet, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G7H20TKI67 (5-aminolevulinic acid hexyl ester)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Protoporphyrins/metabolism']",2006/10/13 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-0190-x [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Nov;11(11):2031-42. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-0190-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed subsequently to identify pluripotent cells in the testicular cells, which would induce the germline transmission. Testicular cells retrieved from juvenile (4-wk-old) or adult (24-wk-old) White Leghorn (WL) chickens were stained with germ cell-specific markers anti-SSEA1, anti-SSEA3, anti-SSEA4, anti-EMA1, anti-ITGA6, and anti-ITGB1 antibodies; 2C9; and lectin-Solanum tuberosum agglutinin (STA). The percentages of the cells that were positive for each marker were within the ranges of 0.33% -0.44% and 0.029%-0.072% of the total testicular cell population in the juvenile and adult, respectively, and significant (P < 0.0002) differences were detected between the ages. When 1 x 10(6) testicular cells were cultured in Dulbecco minimum essential medium-based medium supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), and/or insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF1), colony formation was detected only in LIF++FGF2-containing or LIF+FGF2+IGF1-containing medium during primary culture, and the supplementation of LIF+FGF2+IGF1 was the most efficient for maintaining the colony-forming cells through subculture. The established cells retrieved at the end of the primary culture or the 20th subpassage were positive for chicken germ cell-specific periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), EMA1, 2C9, SSEA1, SSEA3, SSEA4, ITGA6, and ITGB1; and lectin-STA markers (evaluated after 11th subpassage). Double staining of lectin-STA with anti-SSEA1, anti-SSEA3, anti-SSEA4, anti-ITGA6, and anti-ITGB1 also was possible.

Our aim was to examine this association in the Jerusalem Perinatal Study, a population-based cohort comprising all offspring from western Jerusalem and surroundings born from 1964 to 1976. METHODS: Identity numbers of non-malformed singletons with recorded data about hospital admission in the 1st year of life (n = 24,554) were linked to the Population and Cancer Registries. Person-year incidence rates were calculated for the exposed (admitted for infection) and nonexposed (not admitted for infection) groups from birth to date of cancer diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2004. We used Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for covariates associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 36 years. Cancer developed in 283 individuals. Hospitalization for infection was not associated with overall cancer risk [risk ratio (RR), 0.88; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.56-1.37]. The incidence rate for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was higher in the exposed compared with the nonexposed group (RR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.38-8.68), remaining unchanged after controlling for birth weight, gender, and maternal education. Leukemia risk was not significantly associated (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.06-3.24) with hospitalization for infection. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admission in the 1st year of life due to infection is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is consistent with observations that mild immunodeficiencies predispose to lymphoma. Survival of infants with subtle immune defects, who may have previously succumbed to their infection, may contribute to the increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma observed over the last 50 years.","['Paltiel, Ora', 'Laniado, David E', 'Yanetz, Rivlca', 'Deutsch, Lisa', 'Calderon-Margalit, Ronit', 'Harlap, Susan', 'Friedlander, Yehiel']","['Paltiel O', 'Laniado DE', 'Yanetz R', 'Deutsch L', 'Calderon-Margalit R', 'Harlap S', 'Friedlander Y']","['School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. ora@vms.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*epidemiology/ethnology/*therapy', 'Israel/ethnology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Odds Ratio', '*Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data', 'Population Surveillance', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors']",2006/10/13 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['15/10/1964 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0313 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2006 Oct;15(10):1964-8. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0313.,,,['2R01-CA-80197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To provide a more robust estimate of the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms on the risk of ALL, we did a meta-analysis to reevaluate the association between the two most commonly studied MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) and ALL risk. All case-control studies investigating an association between the C677T or A1298C polymorphisms and risk of ALL were included. We applied both fixed-effects and random-effects models to combine odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Q-statistic was used to evaluate the homogeneity and both Egger and Begg-Mazumdar tests were used to assess publication bias. The meta-analysis of the C677T polymorphism and risk of childhood ALL included 13 studies with a total of 4,894 individuals. Under a fixed-effects model, the TT genotype failed to be associated with a statistically significant reduction of childhood ALL risk (TT versus CT + CC: OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73-1.06; P = 0.18).

In both cases, no evidence of heterogeneity was observed. No association between the A1298C variant and susceptibility to both adult and childhood ALL was disclosed.

The authors selected 365 children under age 15 years who had been diagnosed with incident leukemia and birth certificate controls who were matched to them on age, sex, Hispanic ethnicity, and maternal race. Data on maternal illnesses and drug use from before pregnancy through breastfeeding were obtained by interview with the biologic mother and were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. Maternal history of influenza/pneumonia was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the offspring (odds ratio (OR) = 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24, 2.89), although the risk was nonsignificant for common ALL (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 0.75, 2.63).

Observing an increased risk of leukemia in children of mothers reporting a history of influenza/pneumonia and sexually transmitted disease around the time of pregnancy suggests that maternal infection might contribute to the etiology of leukemia.

Therefore, any retrovirus that has evolved the ability to replicate in a given animal must have developed mechanisms that allow it to avoid or inhibit the APOBEC3 proteins expressed in that animal. Here, we demonstrate that Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) is resistant to inhibition by the APOBEC3G protein expressed in its normal host, the rhesus macaque, but highly susceptible to inhibition by murine APOBEC3 (mA3). MPMV virion particles fail to package rhesus APOBEC3G (rA3G), and MPMV Gag binds rA3G poorly in coexpressing cells. In contrast, MPMV virions package mA3 efficiently and MPMV Gag-mA3 complexes are readily detected. Moreover, mA3, but not rA3G, partially colocalizes with MPMV Gag in the cytoplasm of coexpressing cells. Previously, we have demonstrated that murine leukemia virus also escapes inhibition by APOBEC3 proteins by avoiding virion incorporation of its cognate APOBEC3 protein, mA3, yet is inhibited by primate APOBEC3G proteins, which it packages effectively (B. P. Doehle, A. Schafer, H. L. Wiegand, H. P. Bogerd, and B. R. Cullen, J. Virol. 79:8201-8207, 2005).

We investigated the stoichiometry of Env-mediated fusion and its inhibition by antibody by inserting an epitope from human immunodeficiency virus for a neutralizing antibody (2F5) into the surface (SU) or transmembrane (TM) protein of murine leukemia virus Env, along with point mutations that abrogate SU and TM function but complement one another. We transfected various combinations of these Env genes and investigated Env-mediated cell fusion and its inhibition by 2F5 antibody. Our results showed that heterotrimers with one functional SU molecule were fusion competent in complementation experiments and that one antibody molecule was sufficient to inactivate the fusion function of a trimer when its epitope was in functional SU or TM. 2F5 antibody could also neutralize trimers with the 2F5 epitope in nonfunctional SU or TM, but less efficiently.","['Ou, Wu', 'Silver, Jonathan']","['Ou W', 'Silver J']","['Building 4/Room 336, 4 Center Dr., Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/*metabolism', '*Virus Internalization']",2006/10/13 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01318-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01318-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Dec;80(24):11982-90. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01318-06.

This association is regarded as the critical effect in risk assessment. Creating effective policy in light of widespread exposure and the undisputed value of safe, reliable, and economic electricity to society is difficult and requires estimates of the potential public health impact and associated uncertainties. OBJECTIVES: Although a causal relationship between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia has not been established, we present estimates of the possible pubic health impact using attributable fractions to provide a potentially useful input into policy analysis under different scenarios. METHODS: Using ELF exposure distributions from various countries and dose-response functions from two pooled analyses, we calculate country-specific and worldwide estimates of attributable fractions (AFs) and attributable cases. RESULTS: Even given a wide range of assumptions, we find that the AF remains < 10%, with point estimates ranging from < 1% to about 4%. For small countries with low exposure, the number of attributable cases is less than one extra case per year. Worldwide the range is from 100 to 2,400 cases possibly attributable to ELF exposure. CONCLUSION: The fraction of childhood leukemia cases possibly attributable to ELF exposure across the globe appears to be small. There remain, however, a number of uncertainties in these AF estimates, particularly in the exposure distributions.","['Kheifets, Leeka', 'Afifi, Abdelmonem A', 'Shimkhada, Riti']","['Kheifets L', 'Afifi AA', 'Shimkhada R']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095-1772, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', '*Public Health']",2006/10/13 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8977 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2006 Oct;114(10):1532-7. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8977.,,,,PMC1626420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of the different HSPGs in itself is tightly regulated providing strict controls on the activities of the bound ligands. Human liver is a target for a number of pathogens, and HSPGs have been demonstrated in several cases to play a pivotal role in infectivity. Despite HSPGs important biological functions, little is known about its cell-specific distribution patterns. Human liver HSPG was isolated, and a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1E4-1C2 was produced. Distribution of HSPG reactive to this mAb was studied in normal blood cells, hematopoietic cell lines and blood cells isolated from patients with various hematologic disorders using indirect immunofluorescence. There was no expression of molecules recognized by this mAb on lymphoid (Daudi, Jurkat, SupT-1) and monocytoid (U937) cell lines. Peripheral blood cells, normal bone marrow, together with leukocytes isolated from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, were also negative. In contrast, 1E4-1C2 showed significant positive results on human myeloid cell lines HL-60 and K562. Moreover, it is interesting that this mAb also recognized epitopes on leukocytes isolated from acute myeloblastic leukemia. These results suggest that malignancies of cells in myeloid lineage may cause expression of HSPGs that are detected by this specific mAb, making it a potential co-marker for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Vongchan, Preeyanat', 'Linhardt, Robert J']","['Vongchan P', 'Linhardt RJ']","['Division of Transfusion Science, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. preyanat@chiangmai.ac.th <preyanat@chiangmai.ac.th>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Lineage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/*biosynthesis/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Liver/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2006/10/13 09:00,2007/03/08 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1521-6616(06)00871-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clim.2006.08.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2007 Feb;122(2):194-206. doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2006.08.017.

After being transported into cancer cells, dFdC is phosphorylated to dFdC triphosphate (dFdCTP), which is subsequently incorporated into the DNA strand, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Intracellular dFdCTP is the critical determinant for dFdC cytotoxicity, so therapeutic drug monitoring or in vitro testing of the capability of cancer cells to accumulate dFdCTP may be informative for optimizing dFdC administration. We have developed a new isocratic-elution high-performance liquid chromatography method for quantifying dFdCTP in cancer cells. Samples (500 microL) were eluted isocratically using 0.06 M Na(2)HPO(4) (pH 6.9) containing 20% acetonitrile, at a constant flow rate of 0.7 mL/min and at ambient temperature. Separation was carried out using an anion-exchange column (TSK gel DEAE-2SW; 250 mm x 4.6 mm inside diameter, particle size 5 microL) and monitored at 254 nm. The standard curve was linear with low within-day and interday variability. The lower detection limit (20 pmol) was as sensitive as that of the previous gradient-elution method. dFdCTP was well separated from other nucleoside triphosphates. The method could measure dFdCTP in cultured or primary leukemic cells treated in vitro with dFdC. The method was also applicable to simultaneous determination of dFdCTP and cytarabine triphosphate, the results of which demonstrated ara-CTP production augmented by dFdC pretreatment. Thus, our isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography assay method will be of great use because of its sensitivity and simplicity as well as its applicability to biological materials.","['Nishi, Rie', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Nishi R', 'Yamauchi T', 'Ueda T']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3, Shimoaizuki, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*analysis', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/analysis', '*Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/analysis', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/10/13 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS323 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00323.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2006 Nov;97(11):1274-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00323.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two distinct mechanisms have been implicated as potential triggers of t-AML translocations: TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage and apoptotic higher-order chromatin fragmentation. Assessment of the role of TOP2 in this process has been hampered by a lack of techniques allowing in vivo mapping of TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage at nucleotide resolution in single-copy genes. A novel method, extension ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (ELMPCR), was used here for mapping topoisomerase-mediated DNA strand breaks and apoptotic DNA cleavage across a translocation-prone region of MLL in human cells. We report the first genomic map integrating translocation breakpoints and topoisomerase I, TOP2, and apoptotic DNA cleavage sites at nucleotide resolution across an MLL region harboring a t-AML translocation hotspot. This hotspot is flanked by a TOP2 cleavage site and is localized at one extremity of a minor apoptotic cleavage region, where multiple single- and double-strand breaks were induced by caspase-activated apoptotic nucleases. This cleavage pattern was in sharp contrast to that observed approximately 200 bp downstream in the exon 12 region, which displayed much stronger apoptotic cleavage but where no double-strand breaks were detected and no t-AML-associated breakpoints were reported. The localization and remarkable clustering of the t-AML breakpoints cannot be explained simply by the DNA cleavage patterns but might result from potential interactions between TOP2 poisoning, apoptotic DNA cleavage, and DNA repair attempts at specific sites of higher-order chromatin structure in apoptosis-evading cells. ELMPCR provides a new tool for investigating the role of DNA topoisomerases in fundamental genetic processes and translocations associated with cancer treatments involving topoisomerase-targeted drugs.","['Mirault, Marc-Edouard', 'Boucher, Patrick', 'Tremblay, Alain']","['Mirault ME', 'Boucher P', 'Tremblay A']","[""Unit of Health and Environment, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec-Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. memirault@crchul.ulaval.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Breaks', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Exons', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/10/13 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9297(07)60823-4 [pii]', '10.1086/507791 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 2006 Nov;79(5):779-91. doi: 10.1086/507791.

In one of these (chronic myeloid leukemia), there is an associated pathognomonic chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This leads to constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for the disease and is used as a target for effective therapy. This review concentrates on the search in the other conditions (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic mylofibrosis) for a similar biological marker with therapeutic potential. There is no obvious chromosomal marker in these conditions and yet evidence of clonality can be obtained in females by the use of X-inactivation patterns. PRV-1mRNA over expression, raised vitamin B12 levels and raised neutrophil alkaline phosphatase scores are evidence that cells in these conditions have received excessive signals for proliferation, maturation and reduced apoptosis. The ability of erythroid colonies to grow spontaneously without added external erythropoietin in some cases, provided a useful marker and a clue to this abnormal signaling. In the past year several important discoveries have been made which go a long way in elucidating the involved pathways. The recently discovered JAK2 V617F mutation which occurs in the majority of cases of polycythemia vera and in about half of the cases with the two other conditions, enables constitutive tyrosine kinase activity without the need for ligand binding to hematopoietic receptors. This mutation has become the biological marker for these conditions and has spurred the development of a specific therapy to neutralize its effects. The realization that inherited mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) can cause a phenotype of thrombocytosis such as in Mpl Baltimore (K39N) and in a Japanese family with S505A, has prompted the search for acquired mutations in this receptor in chronic myeloproliferative disease. Recently, two mutations have been found; W515L and W515K. These mutations have been evident in patients with essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis but not in polycythemia vera. They presumably act by causing constitutional, activating conformational changes in the receptor. The discovery of JAK2 and Mpl mutations is leading to rapid advancements in understanding the pathophysiology and in the treatment of these diseases.","['Bennett, Michael', 'Stroncek, David F']","['Bennett M', 'Stroncek DF']","[""Department of Hematology, Ha'Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel. benet_m@clalit.org.il""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,,,,2006/10/13 09:00,2006/10/13 09:01,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:01 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-5876-4-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-4-41 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2006 Oct 11;4:41. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-4-41.,20061011,,,PMC1634874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike tryptase and chymase, its potential function and expression in diseased conditions remain largely unknown. To develop an assay for hMC-CP, the recombinant fusion protein of hMC-CP and purified native skin hMC-CP was prepared, and two novel monoclonal antibodies against hMC-CP named CCP1 (IgG1 isotype) and CCP2 (IgM isotype) were raised in the present study. Epitope analysis shows that CCP1 and CCP2 antibodies recognize epitopes located in the region of amino acids 112-202 of hMC-CP, and hydrophilicity analysis implies that epitopes might be located in the amino acid residues 123-134 and 165-177. Furthermore, using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, it was shown that the epitope recognized by CCP1 is close to that recognized by CCP2 or the two antibodies partially share the same epitope. Flow cytometry analysis shows that basophilic leukemia cell line KU812 reacts with both CCP1 and CCP2 antibodies, suggesting that this cell line expresses hMC-CP. In conclusion, although the two antibodies possess different isotypes, they may partially share the same epitope. These two antibodies will be valuable tools for the development of an assay to detect the levels of hMC-CP in the biological fluids in man.","['Zhou, Y', 'Chen, Z', 'He, S']","['Zhou Y', 'Chen Z', 'He S']","['The Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Allergy and Inflammation Research Institute, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Carboxypeptidases/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Epitope Mapping', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",2006/10/13 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['SJI1789 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3083.2006.01789.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2006 Nov;64(5):564-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2006.01789.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATO also shows significant activity in relapsed/refactory multiple myeloma; however, efforts to expand clinical utility to other cancers have been limited by its toxicity profile at higher doses. New bioavailable, liposome encapsulated As(III) materials exhibit a significantly attenuated cytotoxicity that undergoes pH-triggered release of an active drug. The arsenic drugs are loaded into 100-nm-scale liposomes at high concentration (>270 mM) and excellent retention (shelf life > 6 months at 4 degrees C), as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) diffraction. In the loading mechanism, arsenous acid crosses the bilayer membrane in exchange for acetic acid and an insoluble transitional metal (e.g., Ni2+, Co2+) arsenite salt is formed. The resultant liposomal arsenic nanoparticles appear to be stable in physiological situations but release the drug cargo in a lower pH environment, as encountered in intracellular endosomes. These drugs exhibit attenuated cytotoxicities against human lymphoma tumor cells compared with that of free As2O3. Controlled release of arsenic drugs, and hence control of toxicity, is feasible with this system. The results demonstrate that cytotoxicity can be controlled via transitions of the inorganic drug between solid and solution phases and suggest a mechanism for further improvement of the risk/benefit ratio of As2O3 in treatment of a variety of cancers.","['Chen, Haimei', 'MacDonald, Robert C', 'Li, Shuyou', 'Krett, Nancy L', 'Rosen, Steven T', ""O'Halloran, Thomas V""]","['Chen H', 'MacDonald RC', 'Li S', 'Krett NL', 'Rosen ST', ""O'Halloran TV""]","['Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Capsules)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oxides)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Capsules/*chemistry', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/*methods', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Liposomes/*chemistry', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/10/13 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ja064864h [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2006 Oct 18;128(41):13348-9. doi: 10.1021/ja064864h.,,,"['GM 054111/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA 119341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and eighteen patients with CML in early chronic phase entered the study. Twenty-eight out of 32 patients assigned to group A received two cycles of a combination of intensified cytarabine and idarubicin followed by interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) maintenance, 28 patients in group B received standard treatment by a combination of low-dose cytarabine and IFN-alpha.

The purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro activity of thalidomide as a single agent and in combination with prednisolone or cytarabine in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples of 40 childhood ALL patients, normal lymphocytes of 9 healthy adults, and 3 lymphoid cell lines were evaluated for cytotoxicity of thalidomide (alone and in combination with prednisolone and cytarabine) using the MTT assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Thalidomide as a single agent had weak antileukemic activity to the childhood ALL samples. However, in the presence of thalidomide the cytotoxicities of prednisolone and cytarabine were increased 3.3-fold (p<0.001) and 2.7-fold (p=0.002), respectively. Thalidomide increased apoptosis in lymphoblasts and modulated the cell-cycle arrest caused by prednisolone, but not that by cytarabine, in childhood ALL samples. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide increases in vitro the sensitivity of childhood ALL cells to prednisolone and cytarabine.","['Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Zaborowska, Agnieszka', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Czyzewski K', 'Zaborowska A', 'Styczynski J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum of Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2006/10/13 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00005-006-0036-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2006 Sep-Oct;54(5):341-5. doi: 10.1007/s00005-006-0036-9.

PML NB number can change during the cell cycle, increasing in S phase and in response to cellular stress, including DNA damage. Although topological changes in chromatin after DNA damage may affect the integrity of PML NBs, the molecular or structural basis for an increase in PML NB number has not been elucidated. We demonstrate that after DNA double-strand break induction, the increase in PML NB number is based on a biophysical process, as well as ongoing cell cycle progression and DNA repair. PML NBs increase in number by a supramolecular fission mechanism similar to that observed in S-phase cells, and which is delayed or inhibited by the loss of function of NBS1, ATM, Chk2, and ATR kinase. Therefore, an increase in PML NB number is an intrinsic element of the cellular response to DNA damage.","['Dellaire, Graham', 'Ching, Reagan W', 'Ahmed, Kashif', 'Jalali, Farid', 'Tse, Kenneth C K', 'Bristow, Robert G', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Dellaire G', 'Ching RW', 'Ahmed K', 'Jalali F', 'Tse KC', 'Bristow RG', 'Bazett-Jones DP']","['The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/enzymology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism/physiology']",2006/10/13 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200604009 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200604009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2006 Oct 9;175(1):55-66. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200604009.,,,,PMC2064496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the association between medical test irradiation, a postulated leukemogenic agent, and acute leukemia among children with Down syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with Down syndrome (controls) were frequency matched on age to children with Down syndrome and leukemia (cases) diagnosed at ages 0 to 19 years during the period 1997-2002 at participating Children's Oncology Group institutions in North America. Telephone interviews were completed with mothers of 158 cases (n = 97 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and n = 61 acute myeloid leukemia) and 173 controls. Paternal interviews were completed with 275 fathers and 40 mothers serving as surrogates. Three irradiation exposure periods were examined: preconception, in utero, and postnatal. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the associations of interest, resulting in odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: There was little evidence that maternal or paternal preconception irradiation exposure, intrauterine exposure, or postnatal exposure contributes to leukemogenesis in children with Down syndrome. Overall, no evidence for an effect of any periconceptional exposure was observed. Similar results were observed among acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia cases analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study, to our knowledge, to examine such an association among this unique patient population. The results do not provide evidence of a positive association between ionizing radiation exposure and acute leukemia among children with Down syndrome. The absence of an association should be encouraging for concerned parents of children with Down syndrome who undergo a series of diagnostic radiographs in the course of their standard care.","['Linabery, Amy M', 'Olshan, Andrew F', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Blair, Cindy K', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Linabery AM', 'Olshan AF', 'Gamis AS', 'Smith FO', 'Heerema NA', 'Blair CK', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Male', 'Parents']",2006/10/13 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['peds.2006-0644 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2006-0644 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2006 Nov;118(5):e1499-508. doi: 10.1542/peds.2006-0644.

In this study, we investigated the significance of TRX in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the ability and mechanism to ameliorate experimental colitis. METHODS: Serum TRX and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels were measured in patients with IBD. The effects of TRX were evaluated in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model by comparing TRX-overexpressing transgenic (TRX-TG) and control mice. We further evaluated the effect of recombinant human TRX (rhTRX) administration on DSS-induced colitis and colonic inflammation of interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice. Colonic inflammation was examined clinically and histologically. Proinflammatory cytokine levels were examined in colonic tissues, and MIF levels were measured in colonic tissues and sera in mice. The effect of TRX on MIF production was also analyzed in vitro. RESULTS: Serum TRX and MIF levels were significantly higher in patients with IBD than normal controls, and TRX levels correlated with disease activity. TRX significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis and colonic inflammation of IL-10 KO mice. Increase of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in colonic tissues was significantly suppressed in TRX-TG mice compared with wild-type mice. MIF levels in colonic tissues and sera were significantly lower in TRX-TG mice than in wild-type mice, irrespective of DSS administration. Anti-TRX treatment exacerbated DSS-induced colitis. In vitro studies demonstrated that rhTRX suppressed MIF production in human monocyte cells. CONCLUSIONS: TRX might have a potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of IBD.","['Tamaki, Hiroyuki', 'Nakamura, Hajime', 'Nishio, Akiyoshi', 'Nakase, Hiroshi', 'Ueno, Satoru', 'Uza, Norimitsu', 'Kido, Masahiro', 'Inoue, Satoko', 'Mikami, Sakae', 'Asada, Masanori', 'Kiriya, Keiichi', 'Kitamura, Hiroshi', 'Ohashi, Shinya', 'Fukui, Toshiro', 'Kawasaki, Kimio', 'Matsuura, Minoru', 'Ishii, Yasuyuki', 'Okazaki, Kazuichi', 'Yodoi, Junji', 'Chiba, Tsutomu']","['Tamaki H', 'Nakamura H', 'Nishio A', 'Nakase H', 'Ueno S', 'Uza N', 'Kido M', 'Inoue S', 'Mikami S', 'Asada M', 'Kiriya K', 'Kitamura H', 'Ohashi S', 'Fukui T', 'Kawasaki K', 'Matsuura M', 'Ishii Y', 'Okazaki K', 'Yodoi J', 'Chiba T']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TXN protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9042-14-2 (Dextran Sulfate)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.2.1 (Mif protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticoagulants', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Colon/metabolism', 'Crohn Disease/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Dextran Sulfate', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/genetics', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/*blood', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/blood/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2006/10/13 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0016-5085(06)01762-8 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2006.08.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2006 Oct;131(4):1110-21. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2006.08.023.

Although experimental data support the improbability that semen from BLV-positive bulls could infect recipient cows, restriction for commercialization of semen from infected animals is still present. The objective of this work was to standardize a PCR assay to diagnose the presence of BLV genome in frozen semen samples. The developed methodology involves the amplification of an internal fragment of gag gene. The limit of detection of this technique was six viral particles, using gag-PCR followed by hybridization analysis. Frozen semen samples from seropositive bulls were analyzed. It was possible to detect proviral DNA in 9 out of 173 samples. Additionally, a biological test in susceptible sheep was performed in order to evaluate the transmission of BLV genome by semen from seropositive animals. This data strongly suggest that semen from seropositive bulls that resulted negative by PCR can be used for artificial insemination (AI), accompanied by proper collection protocols. The development of this PCR assay constitutes a valuable diagnostic tool to determine the BLV-free status of frozen semen samples used for AI.","['Dus Santos, Maria Jose', 'Trono, Karina', 'Lager, Irene', 'Wigdorovitz, Andres']","['Dus Santos MJ', 'Trono K', 'Lager I', 'Wigdorovitz A']","['Instituto de Virologia S.

It has a characteristic histopathologic pattern, with necrosis of the eccrine glands and a local neutrophilic infiltrate. It occurs mostly in patients receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloblastic leukemia or, less frequently, another malignancy. Its occurrence in healthy patients is rare. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with no remarkable medical history who developed an erythematous papular facial eruption. Skin biopsy showed typical features of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis including neutrophilic infiltrate. No cause was found. The patient was successfully treated with colchicine. DISCUSSION: This case is particular because NEH was not associated with malignant hematologic disease, solid cancer, chemotherapy, fever or any other disease, after a follow-up of 22 months. Such idiopathic NEH has been reported only rarely in adults. The second particularity is the length of the eruption, which required colchicine treatment. Clinical improvement occurred within 1 month. Because hematologic malignancies can in some cases be preceded by neutrophilic dermatitis, clinical follow-up is recommended in adults.","['Belot, Veronique', 'Perrinaud, Adeline', 'Corven, Cloe', 'de Muret, Anne', 'Lorette, Gerard', 'Machet, Laurent']","['Belot V', 'Perrinaud A', 'Corven C', 'de Muret A', 'Lorette G', 'Machet L']","['Service de dermatologie, centre hospitalier Universitaire, Tours (37).']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,"['0 (Gout Suppressants)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Colchicine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/*therapeutic use', 'Hidradenitis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged']",2006/10/10 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0755-4982(06)74837-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0755-4982(06)74837-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Presse Med. 2006 Oct;35(10 Pt 1):1475-8. doi: 10.1016/s0755-4982(06)74837-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hidradenite eccrine neutrophilique idiopathique de l'adulte d'evolution prolongee traitee par colchicine.,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the CD38 expression in 102 B-CLL patients referred to our department over a period of 12 months. RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 0 to 18 years. 30 patients (29%) were CD38-positive (CD38+) and 72 patients (71%) were CD38-negative (CD38-) with a median age of 65 and 64 years, respectively. Of the Binet A patients (77), 25% showed an expression of CD38; in Binet B/C patients (25), 67% expressed CD38. Median survival of the CD38- group was 77.5 months and of the CD38+ group 56.3 months. CD38 expression was associated with shorter lymphocyte doubling time (p < 0.0001), a more advanced stage of the disease, and a shorter therapy- and progression-free time (p < 0.0017/p < 0.0012), which was also true in the Binet A subgroup. In 2 cases, we detected a shift from the CD38- to the CD38+ phenotype.

Preliminary results].,323-34,"OBJECTIVE: Initiation and popularization of routine molecular diagnostics of minimal residual disease (MRD) are currently one of the most urgent challenges in Polish hemato-oncology. The paper is aimed to present preliminary results of identification of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements and quantitative assessment of MRD levels in Polish children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The results are presented in the context of clinical significance of MRD study, current methodology of MRD assessment and standardization process in Western Europe. MATERIAL: DNA isolated from bone marrow / bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained at diagnosis from 26 children (25 B-precursor ALL, 1 T-ALL) aged 1.3-16.5 years. METHODS: PCR-heteroduplex analysis, based on standard BIOMED-1 and BIOMED-2 primer combinations and protocols for detection of rearrangements and clonality assessment; sequencing of clonal PCR products and comparison with germline sequences of Ig/TCR genes for identification of the rearranged genes andjunctional regions; real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) with the use of TaqMan probes for assessment of follow-up MRD levels (in 11 patients).

Molecular cloning of a corresponding cDNA was carried out, and it encoded for a 70-kDa protein consisting of a half cytokine binding domain containing the canonical WSXWS motif, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and the first half of a second cytokine binding domain with cysteines in fixed positions. Analysis of the soluble receptor distribution revealed a preferential expression in lung, liver, pancreas, and placenta. sOSMR was able to bind OSM and interleukin-31 when associated to soluble gp130 or soluble interleukin-31R, respectively, and to neutralize both cytokine properties. We have also shown that OSM could positively regulate the synthesis of its own soluble receptor in tumor cells.","['Diveu, Caroline', 'Venereau, Emilie', 'Froger, Josy', 'Ravon, Elisa', 'Grimaud, Linda', 'Rousseau, Francois', 'Chevalier, Sylvie', 'Gascan, Hugues']","['Diveu C', 'Venereau E', 'Froger J', 'Ravon E', 'Grimaud L', 'Rousseau F', 'Chevalier S', 'Gascan H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, U564, F-49033 Angers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (IL31 protein, human)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/chemistry/*physiology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M/chemistry/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/chemistry/*physiology', 'Tissue Distribution']",2006/10/10 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)72012-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M607005200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 1;281(48):36673-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M607005200.

However, in some cases, STAT3 has been shown to be pro-apoptotic, especially in mammary epithelial cells. In this report, we generated SOCS3-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in which STAT3 activation is extremely enhanced and prolonged. We found that LIF induces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis of SOCS3(-/-) MEFs. Exogenous expression of the dominant negative form of STAT3 but not STAT1 suppressed LIF-induced apoptosis of SOCS3(-/-) MEFs, indicating that STAT3 plays a critical role in apoptosis induction. As shown in mammary gland epithelial cells, expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunits p50alpha and p55alpha was induced in response to LIF in SOCS3(-/-) MEFs but not in wild-type MEFs, and Akt/protein kinase B activity was substantially reduced in SOCS3(-/-) MEFs. Furthermore, we found that some of the STAT3 target genes related to apoptosis and proliferation, such as Bcl-2 and cyclin D1, were repressed upon LIF treatment in SOCS3(-/-) cells. Not only the up-regulation of p50alpha and p55alpha but also the repression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 in SOCS3(-/-) MEFs was inhibited by dominant negative STAT3. These data suggest that prolonged activation of STAT3 could induce apoptosis/growth arrest rather than anti-apoptosis and proliferation in certain cases, and SOCS3 is a critical regulator of this balance.","['Lu, Yang', 'Fukuyama, Satoru', 'Yoshida, Ryoko', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Saeki, Kazuko', 'Shiraishi, Hiroshi', 'Yoshimura, Akihiko', 'Takaesu, Giichi']","['Lu Y', 'Fukuyama S', 'Yoshida R', 'Kobayashi T', 'Saeki K', 'Shiraishi H', 'Yoshimura A', 'Takaesu G']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics/*physiology']",2006/10/10 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)72013-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M607374200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 1;281(48):36683-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M607374200.

We previously showed by segregation analysis that a dominant gene controls HTLV-1 infection through breast-feeding in children of African origin. Here, we report the mapping of this locus by a genome-wide linkage analysis based on the genetic model provided by segregation analysis. Five pedigrees of African origin with HTLV-1 seropositive children were included in the study. Significant evidence for linkage (LOD score of 3.36, P=0.00004) was obtained for chomosomal region 6q27 when using the robust analysis including only HTLV-1-infected subjects. When HTLV-1 seronegative children born to infected mothers were added in the analysis, a maximum LOD score of 2.79 (P=0.0002) was obtained for chomosome 2p25. This result was mostly due to the largest pedigree of our sample, which alone gave a LOD score of 2.90 (P=0.00013). We further excluded the role of exonic variants of two candidate genes located in the linked regions, CCR6 (chemokine receptor 6) in 6q27 and ID2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) in 2p25. Our results, mapping a major susceptibility locus to chromosome 6q27 and suggesting genetic heterogeneity with another locus at 2p25, pave the way to the determination of the molecular basis of predisposition to HTLV-1 infection in children.","['Plancoulaine, Sabine', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Tortevoye, Patricia', 'Boland-Auge, Anne', 'Vasilescu, Alexandre', 'Matsuda, Fumihiko', 'Abel, Laurent']","['Plancoulaine S', 'Gessain A', 'Tortevoye P', 'Boland-Auge A', 'Vasilescu A', 'Matsuda F', 'Abel L']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Humaine des Maladies Infectieuses, Universite Paris Rene Descartes, INSERM, U550, Faculte de Medecine Necker, 156 rue de Vaugirard, Paris, France. plancoulaine@necker.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (CCR6 protein, human)', '0 (ID2 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Receptors, CCR6)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', 'Receptors, CCR6', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics']",2006/10/10 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['ddl406 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddl406 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2006 Nov 15;15(22):3306-12. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddl406.

We demonstrate that dividing cells can be tracked through at least four cell divisions. In leukemic cell lines, some cells remain labeled for 2 weeks. We show that QDs can be used to follow cells as they differentiate. QDs are seen in monocyte-like and neutrophil-like progeny of labeled HL-60 myeloblasts exposed to Vitamin D analogues and DMSO, respectively. QDs are also observed in monocytes generated from labeled CD34+ cells. In addition, QDs attached to streptavidin can target cells with differing cell surface markers, including CD33. In summary, QDs have the ability to bind to specific cells of interest, be taken up by a diverse range of hematologic cells, and followed through many divisions and through differentiation.

We have now shown that the ZNF198/FGFR1 fusion kinase interacts with the endogenous ZNF198 protein suggesting that the function of ZNF198 may be compromised in cells expressing it. Little is currently known about the endogenous function of ZNF198 and to investigate this further we performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis and identified SUMO-1 as a binding partner of ZNF198. These observations were confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation which demonstrated that ZNF198 is covalently modified by SUMO-1. Since many of the SUMO-1-modified proteins are targeted to the PML nuclear bodies we used confocal microscopy to show that SUMO-1, PML and ZNF198 colocalize to punctate structures, shown by immunocytochemistry to be PML bodies. Using co-immunoprecipitation we now show that PML and sumoylated ZNF198 can be found in a protein complex in the cell. Mutation of the SUMO-1 binding site in wild-type ZNF198 resulted in loss of distinct PML bodies, reduced PML levels and a more dispersed nuclear localization of the PML protein. In cells expressing ZNF198/FGFR1, which also lack the SUMO-1 binding site, SUMO-1 is preferentially localized in the cytoplasm, which is associated with loss of distinct PML bodies. Recently, arsenic trioxide (ATO) was proposed as an alternative therapy for APL that was resistant to traditional therapy. Treatment of cells expressing ZNF198/FGFR1 with ATO demonstrated reduced autophosphorylation of the ZNF198/FGFR1 protein and induced apoptosis, which is not seen in cells expressing wild-type ZNF198. Overall our results suggest that the sumoylation of ZNF198 is important for PML body formation and that the abrogation of sumoylation of ZNF198 in ZNF198/FGFR1 expressing cells may be an important mechanism in cellular transformation.","['Kunapuli, Padmaja', 'Kasyapa, Chitta S', 'Chin, Suet-Feung', 'Caldas, Carlos', 'Cowell, John K']","['Kunapuli P', 'Kasyapa CS', 'Chin SF', 'Caldas C', 'Cowell JK']","['Department of Cancer Genetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (ZMYM2 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2006/10/10 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(06)00257-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.06.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2006 Nov 15;312(19):3739-51. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.06.037.

The X-ray structure of the beta common (betac) receptor ectodomain has given new insights into the structural biology of signaling by IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF. This receptor is shared between the three ligands and functions together with three ligand-specific alpha-subunits. The structure shows betac is an intertwined homodimer in which each chain contains four domains with approximate fibronectin type-III topology. The two betac-subunits that compose the homodimer are interlocked by virtue of the swapping of beta-strands between domain 1 of one subunit and domain 3 of the other subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that the interface between domains 1 and 4 in this unique structure forms the functional epitope. This epitope is similar to those of other members of the cytokine class I receptor family but is novel in that it is formed by two different receptor chains. The chapter also reviews knowledge on the closely related mouse beta(IL-3) receptor and on the alpha-subunit-ligand interactions. The knowledge on the two beta receptors is placed in context with advances in understanding of the structural biology of other members of the cytokine class I receptor family.","['Murphy, James M', 'Young, Ian G']","['Murphy JM', 'Young IG']","['Division of Molecular Bioscience, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Acton, ACT, Australia 0200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,"['0 (CSF2RB protein, human)', '0 (Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit/*chemistry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/chemistry/*physiology', 'Interleukin-5/chemistry/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2006/10/10 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0083-6729(06)74001-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0083-6729(06)74001-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 2006;74:1-30. doi: 10.1016/S0083-6729(06)74001-8.,,,,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cohort study of 4786 men from Estonia who participated in the Chernobyl cleanup from 1986 to 1991 and were traced until December 31, 2002. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and adjusted mortality rate ratio (RR) derived through Poisson regression analysis were calculated. RESULTS: During follow-up, 550 deaths occurred, yielding an SMR of 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.09). Increased risks were observed for suicide alone (SMR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.67) and suicide combined with undetermined injury (SMR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.60). One leukemia death occurred, and no thyroid cancer deaths were found. Elevated mortality also was observed for brain cancer (SMR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.02-6.05). The adjusted RR for suicide remained stable over the time passed since return from the Chernobyl area, showing RRs of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.56-2.10) for 5 to 9 years and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.48-2.05) for 10 or more years compared with less than 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: During the 17 years after the accident, suicide risk in the cohort was greater than in the general male population. No elevated risk in overall mortality and radiation-related cancers was observed. The long-term nature of this elevated risk provides concrete evidence that psychological consequences represent the largest public health problem caused by the accident to date.","['Rahu, Kaja', 'Rahu, Mati', 'Tekkel, Mare', 'Bromet, Evelyn']","['Rahu K', 'Rahu M', 'Tekkel M', 'Bromet E']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, National Institute for Health Development, Tallinn, Estonia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Cohort Studies', 'Estonia/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', '*Suicide']",2006/10/10 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1047-2797(06)00192-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2006.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2006 Dec;16(12):917-9. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2006.07.006.

Disulfiram induces apoptosis in a number of tumor cell lines and was recently by us proposed to act as a 26S proteasome inhibitor. In this work we characterized disulfiram in vitro with regard to tumor-type specificity, possible mechanisms of action and drug resistance and cell death in human tumor cell lines and in 78 samples of tumor cells from patients using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay and the automated fluorescence-imaging microscope ArrayScan((R)). Disulfiram induced cytotoxicity in a biphasic pattern in both cell lines and patient tumor cells. Disulfiram induced apoptosis as measured by cell membrane permeability, nuclear fragmentation/condensation and caspase-3/7 activation using high content screening assays. For many of the cell lines tested disulfiram was active in sub-micromolar concentrations. When comparing the logIC(50) patterns with other cytotoxic agents, disulfiram showed low correlation (R<0.5) with all drugs except lactacystin (R=0.69), a known proteasome inhibitor, indicating that the two substances may share mechanistic pathways. Disulfiram was more active in hematological than in solid tumor samples, but substantial activity was observed in carcinomas of the ovary and the breast and in non-small cell lung cancer. Disulfiram also displayed higher cytotoxic effect in cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia than in normal lymphocytes (p<0.05), which may indicate some tumor selectivity. These results together with large clinical experience and relatively mild side effects encourage clinical studies of disulfiram as an anti-cancer agent.","['Wickstrom, Malin', 'Danielsson, Katarina', 'Rickardson, Linda', 'Gullbo, Joachim', 'Nygren, Peter', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Lovborg, Henrik']","['Wickstrom M', 'Danielsson K', 'Rickardson L', 'Gullbo J', 'Nygren P', 'Isaksson A', 'Larsson R', 'Lovborg H']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Entrance 61, 4th floor Uppsala University Hospital, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden.

ROS generation is one of the deleterious intracellular effects of ionizing radiation, but the role of Prx during radiation treatment has not been extensively explored. Present experiments measure effects of ionizing radiation on expression of human Prx types I (PAGA), II (NKEF-B) and IV (AOE372) in human myeloid leukemia cells (K562). Prx gene transcription was analyzed by amplifying with RT-PCR cDNAs complementary to each Prx-specific coding sequence and by identifying the derived products with Southern blotting procedure. Transcripts of GAPDH were used as the endogenous standard for semi-quantitative comparisons. No consistent increase in Prx gene expression was detected at time intervals up to 72 h after gamma radiation doses that caused cell cycle arrest and nuclear damage (maximum 20 Gy). Immunoblots also were consistent with a prolonged expression or stability of the Prx I/II proteins. Similarly, a cytotoxic concentration of the oxidant hemin, which stimulates rapid hemoglobinization of K562 cells, caused no induction of Prx gene expression.

Once in the cytosol, 1 molecule is capable of killing a cell, making immunotoxins some of the most potent killing agents. Various plant and bacterial toxins have been genetically fused or chemically conjugated to ligands that bind to cancer cells. Among the most active clinically are those that bind to hematologic tumors. At present, only 1 agent, which contains human interleukin-2 and truncated diphtheria toxin, is approved for use in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Another, containing an anti-CD22 Fv and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin, has induced complete remissions in a high proportion of cases of hairy-cell leukemia. Refinement of existing immunotoxins and development of new immunotoxins are underway to improve the treatment of cancer.","['Kreitman, Robert J']",['Kreitman RJ'],"['Clinical Immunotherapy Section, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Centers for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 37, Room 5124B, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA. kreitmar@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",United States,AAPS J,The AAPS journal,101223209,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Toxins/chemistry', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diphtheria Toxin/chemistry', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/metabolism', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/chemistry']",2006/10/10 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1208/aapsj080363 [doi]'],epublish,AAPS J. 2006 Aug 18;8(3):E532-51. doi: 10.1208/aapsj080363.,20060818,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2761061,290,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence and risk factors.,16-23,"OBJECTIVES: Acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGvHD) is a major cause of mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). The goal of this study was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for this complication. METHODS: 330 consecutive patients (183 male and 147 female), aged 29 (10-56) years, treated with alloHCT in a single center between 1992-2003 were included in the analysis. AlloHCT was performed after myeloablative conditioning from either related donor (rel-HCT) (n=223) or unrelated voulnteer (URD-HCT) (n=107). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin, methotrexate +/- prednisolone. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV aGvHD equaled 31% and 17%, respectively. In multivariate analysis the following factors were associated with increased risk of grade II-IV aGvHD: the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (vs. other diagnoses), URD-HCT (vs. Rel-HCT), years of alloHCT 1992-2001 (vs. 2002-2003), donor age > or =35 years, and CD34+ cell dose > or = 4.0 x 10(6)/kg. Increased risk of grade III-IV aGVHD was associated with: the use of prednisolone for aGvHD prophylaxis, the diagnosis of CML or MDS, and CD3+ cell dose > or =100 x l0(6)/kg. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of aGvHD depends on various recipient-, donor-, and procedure-related factors. This should be taken into account when planning treatment for every individual patient.","['Wojnar, Jerzy', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Krawczyk-Kulis, Malgorzata', 'Markiewicz, Miroslaw', 'Kruzel, Tomasz', 'Wylezol, Iwona', 'Czerw, Tomasz', 'Seweryn, Marek', 'Holowiecki, Jerzy']","['Wojnar J', 'Giebel S', 'Krawczyk-Kulis M', 'Markiewicz M', 'Kruzel T', 'Wylezol I', 'Czerw T', 'Seweryn M', 'Holowiecki J']","['Dept. of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Poland. klinhem@slam.katowice.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Transplant,Annals of transplantation,9802544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/10/10 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/10/10 09:00'],"['2006/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Transplant. 2006;11(1):16-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applying a functional proteomics approach, we used a recently developed activity-based, cell-permeable proteasome-specific probe that for the first time allows differential visualization of individual active proteasomal subunits in intact primary cells. In primary leukemia samples, we observed remarkable variability in the amounts of active beta1/1i-, beta2/2i- and beta5/5i-type of subunits, contrasting with their constant protein expression. Bortezomib inhibited beta5- and beta1-type, but to a lesser extend beta2-type of subunits in live primary cells in vitro and in vivo. When we adapted the bortezomib-sensitive human acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 to bortezomib 40 nM (HL-60a), proteasomal activity profiling revealed an upregulation of active subunits, and residual beta1/beta5-type of activity could be visualized in the presence of bortezomib 20 nM, in contrast to control cells. In a panel of cell lines from hematologic malignancies, the ratio between beta2-type and (beta1 + beta5)-type of active proteasomal polypeptides mirrored different degrees of bortezomib sensitivity. We thus conclude that the proteasomal activity profile varies in primary leukemia cells, and that the pattern of proteasomal subunit activity influences the sensitivity of hematologic malignancies toward bortezomib.","['Kraus, M', 'Ruckrich, T', 'Reich, M', 'Gogel, J', 'Beck, A', 'Kammer, W', 'Berkers, C R', 'Burg, D', 'Overkleeft, H', 'Ovaa, H', 'Driessen, C']","['Kraus M', 'Ruckrich T', 'Reich M', 'Gogel J', 'Beck A', 'Kammer W', 'Berkers CR', 'Burg D', 'Overkleeft H', 'Ovaa H', 'Driessen C']","['The Department of Medicine II, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', '*Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*analysis/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404414 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404414 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):84-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404414.

However, a heterogeneous response has recently been observed with immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN). We now show that CpG ODN induce proliferation mainly in CLL B-cells from patients with progressive disease and unmutated immunoglobulin V(H) genes, whereas G(1)/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are induced in leukemic B-cells from stable/V(H) mutated CLL. Examination of early signaling events demonstrated that all CLL B-cells respond to CpG ODN stimulation by degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB and activation of the Akt, ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK kinases, but the magnitude and duration of the signaling response was greater in the proliferating cases. Pharmacological inhibition of these pathways showed that simultaneous activation of Akt, ERK and JNK is required for cell cycle progression and proliferation. Conversely, introduction of constitutively active Akt in nonproliferating CLL B-cells resulted in induction of cyclin A following CpG ODN stimulation, indicating that increased Akt activation is sufficient to overcome the hyporesponsiveness of these cells to proliferative signals. Thus, the magnitude of Akt signaling may determine the distinct responses observed in leukemic B-cells belonging to the different prognostic subgroups.","['Longo, P G', 'Laurenti, L', 'Gobessi, S', 'Petlickovski, A', 'Pelosi, M', 'Chiusolo, P', 'Sica, S', 'Leone, G', 'Efremov, D G']","['Longo PG', 'Laurenti L', 'Gobessi S', 'Petlickovski A', 'Pelosi M', 'Chiusolo P', 'Sica S', 'Leone G', 'Efremov DG']","['ICGEB Hematology Group, Monterotondo-Outstation, CNR Campus Adriano Buzzati-Traverso, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/immunology/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404417 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404417 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):110-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404417.

CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise in ALL patients receiving maintenance therapy provides a similar neutrophil response to that of healthy age and sex-matched controls.","['Ladha, Aliya B', 'Courneya, Kerry S', 'Bell, Gordon J', 'Field, Catherine J', 'Grundy, Paul']","['Ladha AB', 'Courneya KS', 'Bell GJ', 'Field CJ', 'Grundy P']","['Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', '*Exercise', 'Exercise Test', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/therapy', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.mph.0000243644.20993.54 [doi]', '00043426-200610000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2006 Oct;28(10):671-7. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000243644.20993.54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying factors associated with severe infectious complications (SICs) at time of admission for fever and neutropenia is necessary for better treatment. PROCEDURE: We revised all medical charts of patients under 18 years old who developed a first episode of FN present from January 2000 to December 2003. Criteria for a SIC were defined. These included the presence of bacteremia or fungemia, sepsis, septic shock, and/or death from infection. To identify risk factors SIC was associated with the first FN episode. RESULTS: Factors identified in univariate analysis were female sex, age less than 5 years old, acute myeloid leukemia, baseline disease activity, use of central venous catheter, hemoglobin level < 7 g/dL, leukocytes count < 500 cells/mm(3), granulocytes count < 500 cells/mm(3), monocytes count < 100 cells/mm(3), platelets < 20,000, and body temperature > 38.5 degrees C, a chemotherapy interval < 7 days, presence of mucositis, pneumonia, absence of upper respiratory tract infection, or the presence of any clinical focus on first physical examination. In multivariate analysis the variables that remained as independent predictive risk factors for SIC were age less than 5 years, use of central venous catheter, body temperature > 38.5 degrees C, hemoglobin level < 7 g/dL, any clinical focus of infection on first examination and absence of upper respiratory tract infection. The FN population was than divided among 3 different risk groups as follows: group 1 (low risk), group 2 (intermediate risk), with a 13 (4.4 to 38.3)-fold risk for SIC; and group 3 (high risk) with a 50 (16.4 to 149.2)-fold risk for SIC. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that patients with FN can be stratified for risk of SIC using clinical parameters at hospital admission.","['Rondinelli, Patricia Imperatriz Porto', 'Ribeiro, Karina de Cassia Braga', 'de Camargo, Beatriz']","['Rondinelli PI', 'Ribeiro Kde C', 'de Camargo B']","['Department of Pediatrics of the Hospital do Cancer A.

To evaluate the power of MRD monitoring as an indicator of impending relapse, we prospectively analyzed postconsolidation samples of 105 patients enrolled in the German Multicenter ALL (GMALL) trial by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of clonal immune gene rearrangements. All patients were in hematologic remission, had completed first-year polychemotherapy, and tested MRD negative prior to study entry. Twenty-eight of 105 patients (27%) converted to MRD positivity thereafter, and 17 of 28 (61%) relapsed so far. Median time from molecular (MRD-positive) to clinical relapse was 9.5 months. In 15 of these patients, MRD within the quantitative range of PCR was measured in hematologic remission, and 13 of these patients (89%) relapsed after a median interval of 4.1 months. Of the 77 continuously MRD-negative patients, only 5 (6%) have relapsed. We conclude that conversion to MRD positivity during the early postconsolidation phase in adult standard-risk ALL patients is highly predictive of subsequent hematologic relapse.

They are ideal cell sources for tissue engineering and cell therapy, but their supplies are limited. Current in vitro ESC cultures are carried out in tissue flasks with the surface precoated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. T-flask cultures also require frequent subculturing because their limited surface area cannot support long-term growth of ESCs. In this work, ECM coating and frequent subculturing required in two-dimensional (2D) cultures were circumvented by culturing murine ESCs in three-dimensional (3D) polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibrous matrices. Also, media conditioned with STO fibroblast cells were used to replace leukemia inhibitory factor and to effectively maintain the pluripotency of murine ESCs in a long-term static culture. However, the lactic acid present in the conditioned medium could inhibit ESC growth and induce spontaneous differentiation when its concentration exceeded 1.5 g/l. In addition, the 3D static culture could be limited by oxygen, which was depleted in the long-term culture when cell density in the matrix was high. However, these problems can be alleviated in dynamic culture with improved oxygen transfer and continuous media perfusion. The matrix pore size also had profound effects on ESCs. The smaller-pore (30-60 mum) matrix gave a higher proliferation rate and Oct-4 and stage specific embryonic antigen-1 expressions. Overall, the 3D culturing method is superior to the 2D culture method and can provide an economical way to mass-produce undifferentiated ESCs in uncoated matrices and conditioned media.","['Ouyang, Anli', 'Ng, Robin', 'Yang, Shang-Tian']","['Ouyang A', 'Ng R', 'Yang ST']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Polyethylene Terephthalates)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gelatin/pharmacology', 'Lactic Acid/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Polyethylene Terephthalates/*metabolism', 'Porosity/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2006-0322 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2006-0322 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2007 Feb;25(2):447-54. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0322.

Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase and has shown therapeutic effects in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the connection between the clinical activity of decitabine and its demethylating activity is not clear. Herein, we summarize the results of recent clinical trials of decitabine in hematologic malignancies, and review the translational research into decitabine's mechanism of clinical activity. RECENT FINDINGS: Low-dose decitabine has been studied recently in multiple clinical trials and has been shown to be effective for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. Correlative laboratory studies of clinical trials have shown that decitabine induces global hypomethylation as well as hypomethylation of gene-specific promoters and activation of gene expression. Past a given threshold, induction of higher degrees of hypomethylation is not directly associated with a better clinical outcome. Moreover, studies have suggested that patients with promoter hypermethylation of p15(INK4B) at baseline have paradoxically a lower chance of achieving response than those without hypermethylation. Furthermore, several other genes activated by decitabine were independent of hypomethylation in the promoter regions. CONCLUSION: While at least part of decitabine's activity is through induction of hypomethylation and reactivation of critical genes, mechanisms independent from hypomethylation are also important for decitabine's antitumor activity.","['Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Aoki, Etsuko', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Oki Y', 'Aoki E', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. yooki-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['*Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', '*Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(06)00169-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2006.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2007 Feb;61(2):140-52. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2006.07.010.

Dose dependent and cumulative peripheral neuropathy is the main dose limiting side effect of chemotherapy with vincristine. The mechanisms responsible for the neurotoxic effects of vincristine have not yet been fully understood. This prospective study was directed at determining whether vincristine treatment interferes with the function of the medial olivocochlear bundle. DESIGN: Fifteen children suffering from leukemia were subjected to tympanogram, stapedial muscle reflex, pure tone audiometry and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) in the absence and presence of contralateral white noise on day 1 and on day 22 of treatment with vincristine. The function of the medial olivocochlear bundle was assessed by the phenomenon of suppression of otoacoustic emissions by contralateral application of white noise. RESULTS: The study revealed a statistically significant decrease of contralateral suppression amplitudes in all cases after three sessions of chemotherapy with vincristine. On the contrary no alterations were observed in pure tone audiometry thresholds. A non-significant decrease of the mean TEOAEs' amplitudes was also noted. When analyzed by frequency, however, this decrease reached the level of statistical significance at two frequencies. CONCLUSION: Vincristine treatment seems to exert a neurotoxic effect on the efferent olivocochlear system, which takes place early in the course of chemotherapy. This is a new aspect to be added to the possible mechanisms underlying the toxicity of vincristine in the auditory periphery. Whether changes in efferent function might contribute to understanding the mechanisms of neurotoxicity caused by vincristine, or find any clinical application as a predictor or early detector of neurological side effects of vincristine still remains to be seen.","['Riga, M', 'Psarommatis, I', 'Korres, S', 'Varvutsi, M', 'Giotakis, I', 'Apostolopoulos, N', 'Ferekidis, E']","['Riga M', 'Psarommatis I', 'Korres S', 'Varvutsi M', 'Giotakis I', 'Apostolopoulos N', 'Ferekidis E']","['ENT Department,""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital of Athens, Greece. mariariga@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,8003603,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Audiometry, Pure-Tone', 'Child', 'Cochlea/*drug effects', 'Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Olivary Nucleus/*drug effects', 'Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-5876(06)00344-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijporl.2006.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2007 Jan;71(1):63-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2006.09.001.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 54 recent reports focused on the contribution of genetic polymorphisms to the risk of developing leukemia and to disease progression. The polymorphisms of genes encoding drug-metabolising enzymes (CYP family, NQO1, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1), enzymes involved in folate metabolism (MTHFR, TYMS, SHMT1, MTRR), and DNA repair enzymes (XPD, XPG, RAD51, XRCC1, XRCC3, CHEK2, ATM) were considered in the review. RESULTS: There was a good agreement on the influence of NQO1*2 polymorphism and those of the enzymes involved in DNA repair with the increased risk of therapy-related leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. Most studies found a strong association between the polymorphisms MTHFR, C677T or A1298C, and NQO1*2 or *3 and the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In addition, most of the studies reported an association between GSTT1 deletions and an increased risk of de novo acute myeloid leukemia. In ALL, polymorphisms in the genes of folate metabolism are associated with poor prognosis, and the 3R3R TYMS polymorphism in particular is associated with methotrexate resistance. CONCLUSION: The reports reviewed support the hypothesis that several low-penetrance genes with multiplicative effects together with dietary effects, ambient exposition, and individual immune system responses, may account for the risk of leukaemia.","['Bolufer, Pascual', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Collado, Maria', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Lopez, Jose-Antonio', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Bolufer P', 'Barragan E', 'Collado M', 'Cervera J', 'Lopez JA', 'Sanz MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Department of Medical Biopathology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. bolufer_pas@gva.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Enzymes)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes/*genetics', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics/therapy', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00052-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Dec;30(12):1471-91. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.01.016.

The RUNX1 protein is thought to play a role in the control of progression through the cell cycle. We have shown that post-transcriptional regulation of RUNX1 activity occurs, in part, through phosphorylation. To investigate whether transit through the cell cycle is associated with changes in the phosphorylation of RUNX1, we have derived phospho-specific antibodies against three of the five major phosphorylation sites in the transcriptional activation domain of RUNX1, S276, S303 and S462. Using these antibodies we demonstrate that treatment of Jurkat T-cells with nocodazole, a G2/M blocking compound, causes an increase in phosphorylation of these three amino acids. By elutriating the Jurkat cells, we are able to demonstrate that these amino acids are normally phosphorylated at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Using in vivo inhibitors and in vitro assays this phosphorylation appears to be dependent on Cdk1. We find that RUNX1 degradation occurs at the G2/M-G1 transition and is regulated by both Cdc20 and phosphoryation, suggesting that the anaphase promoting complex plays a role in modifying the level of this protein. Regulation of the extent of phosphorylation of RUNX1 may play a role in controlling the degradation of the protein, implying that additional E3 ligases may also be involved.","['Wang, Suiquan', 'Zhang, Youhong', 'Soosairajah, Juliana', 'Kraft, Andrew S']","['Wang S', 'Zhang Y', 'Soosairajah J', 'Kraft AS']","['Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cdc20 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '156288-95-8 (CDC20 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cdc20 Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2006/10/07 09:00,2007/08/07 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00331-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Jun;31(6):839-51. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.08.016.

Several factors are thought to confer this unusual feature to a CLL B-cell. Misbalance between cytoplasmic pro-survival and pro-death molecules, such as Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and alike, appears to be one of the key factors defining B-cell longevity. Autocrine pathways, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor pathway, also contribute to survival. The role of B-cell receptor (BCR) is less straightforward. In the last decade it became clear that CLL does not constitute a uniform disease, but, based on the prevalence of mutations in the BCR heavy chain (IgVH), can be classified into two distinct subgroups. Several molecular markers correlate with IgVH mutations. Some of them, like zeta-chain associated protein kinase, are also involved in BCR signaling and influence cell cycle. Yet the primary pathogenic event leading to increased proliferation and survival in CLL is difficult to ascertain. Molecules involved in BCR signaling pathways and cytoplasmic pro-survival players probably act in concert to confer resistance to apoptosis. In this respect, the role of the B-CLL environment, which includes nurse-like cells and T-cells, cannot be underestimated. Nurse-like cells provide stimuli necessary for perpetuation of life in CLL. On the other hand, abnormal T-cell function, whether it is excessive immunosuppression delivered by regulatory T-cells or insufficient anti-tumor immunity rendered by T-helpers, allows malignant CLL cells to go unnoticed by the cellular immune system.","['Danilov, Alexey V', 'Danilova, Olga V', 'Klein, Andreas K', 'Huber, Brigitte T']","['Danilov AV', 'Danilova OV', 'Klein AK', 'Huber BT']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Brown University School of Medicine, Pawtucket, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology']",2006/10/07 09:00,2006/12/13 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156652406778195008 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2006 Sep;6(6):665-75. doi: 10.2174/156652406778195008.,,,,,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A point mutation in codon 617 causes a valine to phenylalanine substitution (V617F) in the JH2 autoinhibitory region of the protein, resulting in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase. The high prevalence of this conserved mutation in MPD makes it an excellent candidate as a diagnostic molecular marker. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report here the development and validation of a single oligonucleotide probe-based PCR approach using fluorescence melting curve analysis for point mutation detection in DNA derived from unfractionated peripheral blood samples. Using this assay and serial dilutions of an erythroleukemia cell line harboring the homozygous JAK2 V617F mutation, we successfully detected the mutation within a background of wild type sequences at a sensitivity of 2.5%. Our novel fluorescence probe-based assay was compared with allele-specific PCR-gel assay and sequencing techniques. Using the single probe assay, we examined 70 cases with a presumptive diagnosis of MPD, of which 38 (54%) yielded positive results for the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation, and 92 follicular lymphoma cases, which were negative for the JAK2 V617F mutation. Additionally, the probe-based assay detected a previously unreported T>C base substitution at nucleotide 2342 (JAK2, codon 616), which was not detected by an allele-specific PCR assay. CONCLUSION: The single fluorescent probe-based assay described here is a rapid, homogeneous, and robust method for the detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation with favorable performance characteristics that make it advantageous for clinical diagnosis.","['Reading, N Scott', 'Lim, Megan S', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo S J']","['Reading NS', 'Lim MS', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KS']","['Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2006/10/07 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1055 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03256206 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2006;10(5):311-7. doi: 10.1007/BF03256206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterogeneity in partner genes, in chromosomal breakpoints, in MLL itself, and in the different partner genes results in heterogeneous fusion transcripts that can be alternatively spliced, which complicates deciphering a unifying mechanism of leukemogenesis. However, recent microarray studies completed with clinical leukemia specimens have uncovered several distinct mRNA signatures within MLL leukemia that differ from other types of leukemia. A global proteomics strategy using MV4-11 and RS4:11 cells in culture was employed to investigate possible protein signatures common to different MLL leukemias and to identify disease biomarkers and protein targets for pharmacological intervention. Initial proteomics screening experiments with two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis revealed heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90alpha) as a potential target for pharmacological inhibition and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (nm23) as a biomarker for measuring treatment efficacy. Using a modified stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach, coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS), changes in abundance for over 500 proteins were measured. In addition, decreased expression of the novel biomarker nm23 was observed during HSP90 inhibition with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in the MV4-11 cell line. The present study validates the use of a global proteomics strategy to uncover novel biomarkers and pharmacological targets for leukemias with MLL translocations. Additionally, several proteins were found to be expressed in concordance with microarray studies of mRNA expression in specimens from patients showing the value in comparing mRNA transcript and proteomic profiles. This work represents one of the most comprehensive proteomics screens of MLL leukemias that have been conducted to date.","['Yocum, Anastasia K', 'Busch, Christine M', 'Felix, Carolyn A', 'Blair, Ian A']","['Yocum AK', 'Busch CM', 'Felix CA', 'Blair IA']","[""Center for Cancer Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania 19104-4318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/analysis', 'Proteome/*analysis/genetics', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/10/07 09:00,2006/12/19 09:00,['2006/10/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/pr060235v [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2006 Oct;5(10):2743-53. doi: 10.1021/pr060235v.,,,"['R01CA95586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25CA101871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The profiles of plasma protein changes determined using 2-DE analysis were also evaluated to identify potential toxicological monitoring markers in FA-exposed rats. Concern was raised that our genotoxic analyses did not follow previously published research data and that the results of our rat plasma proteomic studies were difficult to interpret because we did not directly determine the plasma concentration of FA. However, we had already determined the concentration of FA using HPLC in an exposure chamber to monitor FA inhalation concentrations. We suggest that our experimental design was suitable to determine the FA effects on rat using an inhalation chamber system. For the similarity of genotoxic effects in lymphocytes and liver cells, we chose to present our data on the general cytological toxic effects on lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation which revealed a similarity between plasma and liver cells of FA-exposed rats. We have shown strong correlations between genotoxicity and lipid peroxidation, and lipid peroxidation is known to mediate DNA damage in many in vitro, and in vivo studies.

The aim of this study was to identify new proteins regulated by PLCbeta(1) overexpression, given the role exerted by its signaling in the nucleus during cell growth and differentiation. To identify novel downstream effectors of nuclear PLCbeta(1)-dependent signaling in Friend erythroleukemia cells, we performed the high-resolution 2-DE-based proteomic analysis. Using a proteomic approach we found that SRp20, a member of the highly conserved SR family of splicing regulators, was down-regulated in cells overexpressing nuclear PLCbeta(1) as compared with wild-type cells. Reduction in SRp20 was confirmed by 2-D Western blotting. Moreover, we have shown that nuclear PLCbeta(1) is bound to the SRp20 splicing factor. Indeed, by immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractioning, we have demonstrated that endogenous PLCbeta(1) and SRp20 physically interact in the nucleus.

Changes in forms of AGP have been described in literature as a possible tumor marker. While most previous works have approached the study of glycopeptides and/or glycans obtained after fragmentation of the protein, in this work, a CZE method is developed to separate up to eleven peaks of intact forms of AGP. A computer program developed in our laboratory is used to select the migration parameters that make possible an accurate assignment of AGP peaks. Electropherograms of AGP samples purified from sera of cancer patients and healthy donors are qualitatively and quantitatively compared. Percentages of correct assignment of AGP peaks close to 100% are achieved by using either the migration time of each peak relative to that of the EOF marker or the effective electrophoretic mobility of the peaks. The computer program permits to select, among different hypotheses for peak allotment, that one providing the highest accuracy of assignment. In this way, some peaks with different charge-to-mass ratio and a different distribution of area percentage of AGP forms are observed when comparing samples from sick and healthy individuals.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of death certificates registered in Mexico during 2003. Adult cases were included if the underlying cause of death was cancer, death location was in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), and information was available on sociodemographic characteristics and place of death (home or medical unit). MAIN RESULTS: Of the 10,561 cases meeting the inclusion criteria, 54% died at home. More women (55%) than men died of cancer and at a younger age (63 vs 64 years, respectively; p<0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that patients diagnosed with leukemia and lymphoma were 3.6 times more likely to die in hospitals than patients diagnosed with other cancers (p<0.001). Compared with patients who died at home, patients who died in hospitals were significantly more educated, younger, and residents of counties with more hospital beds density (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.003, respectively). Certificates for in-hospital deaths were more likely to be signed by other physician or health professional than were those for at-home deaths (p<0.001). Cases with usual residency located outside the study area were 27 times more likely to die in hospitals than were metropolitan-area residents (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients dying at home tended to be of older age, less educated, diagnosed with prostate, urinary tract or gastrointestinal cancers, and residents of the MCMA. Health planners should consider determinants of place of death when allocating hospital or home-based palliative care units.","['Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Carrillo, Maria Teresa', 'Tovalin-Ahumada, Horacio', 'Elting, Linda']","['Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Carrillo MT', 'Tovalin-Ahumada H', 'Elting L']","['Department of Biostatistics and Applied Mathematics, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd Unit 447, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cause of Death', '*Death', 'Death Certificates', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Bed Capacity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/mortality', 'Palliative Care', 'Research Design', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",2006/10/06 09:00,2007/08/11 09:00,['2006/10/06 09:00'],"['2006/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-006-0152-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2007 Mar;15(3):243-9. doi: 10.1007/s00520-006-0152-4.

They developed a high-grade glioma 7-14 years thereafter. Clinical charts, radiologic findings, and pathologic specimens were reviewed. Archival material was stained immunohistochemically. CONCLUSION: Gliomas evolving as second malignant neoplasms show peculiarities and differ in some aspects from their ""spontaneous"" counterparts. Most are supratentorial, contrast-enhancing, space-occupying lesions. They are composed mainly of small undifferentiated cells, which are mainly negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein and positive for microtubule associated proteins 2 (MAP2).

RECENT FINDINGS: Disseminated intravascular coagulation is defined as a typical disease condition with laboratory findings indicating massive coagulation activation and reduction in procoagulant capacity. Clinical syndromes associated with the condition are consumption coagulopathy, sepsis-induced purpura fulminans, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Consumption coagulopathy is observed in patients with sepsis, aortic aneurysms, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and other disseminated malignancies. Sepsis-induced purpura fulminans is characterized by microvascular occlusion causing hemorrhagic necrosis of the skin and organ failure. Viral hemorrhagic fevers result in massively increased tissue factor production in monocytes and macrophages, inducing microvascular thrombosis and consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. Current scoring systems do not distinguish between patients with asymptomatic disseminated intravascular coagulation, consumption coagulopathy and thrombotic syndromes. Patients with sepsis may be identified by activated partial thromboplastin time waveform analysis performed as part of routine coagulation testing. Drotrecogin alpha (activated) reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis with and without disseminated intravascular coagulation and has been used in patients with sepsis-induced purpura fulminans. Tifacogin does not reduce mortality in severe sepsis associated with impaired coagulation. Patients with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation and severe sepsis showed a lower 28-day mortality than patients without this mutation, supporting the assumption that an enhanced level of coagulation activation may be beneficial in patients with severe sepsis. SUMMARY: Whereas antithrombin and tifacogin failed to improve clinical outcome in severe sepsis, drotrecogin alpha (activated) increased the chances of survival of patients with severe sepsis with and without disseminated intravascular coagulation.","['Dempfle, Carl-Erik']",['Dempfle CE'],"['Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany. carl-erik.dempfle@med.ma.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,8813436,,,,2006/10/06 09:00,2006/10/06 09:01,['2006/10/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:01 [medline]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001503-200404000-00006 [pii]', '10.1097/00001503-200404000-00006 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Anaesthesiol. 2004 Apr;17(2):125-9. doi: 10.1097/00001503-200404000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although very few spermatogonial stem cells are present in vivo, we recently succeeded in expanding these cells in vitro. Germ cells from postnatal testes were able to proliferate in the presence of several types of cytokines, and they formed uniquely shaped colonies of spermatogonia (germline stem or GS cells). These cells reinitiated normal spermatogenesis when transplanted into seminiferous tubules. However, much remains unknown about the contributions of cytokines to successful stem cell culture. In the present study, we examined the role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in GS cell culture. We found that the addition of LIF to newborn testis cell culture enhances the formation of germ cell colonies. Ciliary neurotrophic factor, but not oncostatin M, had the same effect, although they both bind to the IL-6ST (gp130) receptor. On the other hand, GS cells could be established from pup or adult testes in the absence of LIF. No phenotypic or functional difference was found between GS cells established from different stages, and normal offspring were born from pup-derived GS cells that had been maintained in the absence of LIF, indicating that LIF per se is not involved in the self-renewal of GS cells. These results demonstrate that LIF is useful in the initiation of GS cell culture and suggest that LIF or a related cytokine is involved in the maturation of gonocytes into spermatogonia.","['Kanatsu-Shinohara, Mito', 'Inoue, Kimiko', 'Ogonuki, Narumi', 'Miki, Hiromi', 'Yoshida, Shosei', 'Toyokuni, Shinya', 'Lee, Jiyoung', 'Ogura, Atsuo', 'Shinohara, Takashi']","['Kanatsu-Shinohara M', 'Inoue K', 'Ogonuki N', 'Miki H', 'Yoshida S', 'Toyokuni S', 'Lee J', 'Ogura A', 'Shinohara T']","['Horizontal Medical Research Organization, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Insemination, Artificial', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncostatin M/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/*growth & development', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Testis/chemistry/*cytology/drug effects']",2006/10/06 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/10/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['biolreprod.106.055863 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.106.055863 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2007 Jan;76(1):55-62. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.106.055863.

In contrast, RAR-beta2 expression is intact in MEFs devoid of menin, a component of MLL1 and MLL2 H3K4MT complexes.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Following exposure to dasatinib and/or vorinostat, apoptosis, loss of clonogenic survival, as well as the activity and levels of Bcr-Abl and its downstream signaling proteins were determined. RESULTS: Treatment with dasatinib attenuated the levels of autophosphorylated Bcr-Abl, p-CrkL, phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (p-STAT5), p-c-Src, and p-Lyn; inhibited the activity of Lyn and c-Src; and induced apoptosis of the cultured CML cells. Combined treatment of cultured human CML and BaF3 cells with vorinostat and dasatinib induced more apoptosis than either agent alone, as well as synergistically induced loss of clonogenic survival, which was associated with greater depletion of Bcr-Abl, p-CrkL, and p-STAT5 levels. Cotreatment with dasatinib and vorinostat also attenuated the levels of Bcr-AblE255K and Bcr-AblT315I and induced apoptosis of BaF3 cells with ectopic expression of the mutant forms of Bcr-Abl. Finally, cotreatment of the primary CML cells with vorinostat and dasatinib induced more loss of cell viability and depleted Bcr-Abl or Bcr-AblT315I, p-STAT5, and p-CrkL levels than either agent alone.

We undertook a phase I study to identify appropriate schedules and doses of bryostatin 1 and fludarabine to be used in phase II studies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or indolent lymphoma received fludarabine daily for 5 days and a single dose of bryostatin 1 via a 24-hour continuous infusion either before or after the fludarabine course. Doses were escalated in successive patients until recommended phase II doses for each sequence were identified on the basis of dose-limiting toxic events. RESULTS: Bryostatin 1 can be administered safely and tolerably with full dose fludarabine (25 mg/m(2)/d x 5). The recommended bryostatin 1 phase II dose is 50 microg/m(2) for both sequences, bryostatin 1 --> fludarabine and fludarabine --> bryostatin 1. The combination is active against both CLL and indolent lymphomas with responses seen in patients who had been previously treated with fludarabine. Correlative studies do not support the hypothesis that bryostatin 1 potentiates fludarabine activity through down-regulation of protein kinase C in target cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bryostatin 1 can be administered with full dose fludarabine, and the combination is moderately active in patients with persistent disease following prior treatment. In view of the activity of monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in the treatment of CLL and indolent lymphomas, the concept of combining bryostatin 1 and fludarabine with rituximab warrants future consideration.","['Roberts, John D', 'Smith, Mitchell R', 'Feldman, Eric J', 'Cragg, Louise', 'Millenson, Michael M', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Honeycutt, Connie', 'Thune, Rose', 'Padavic-Shaller, Kristin', 'Carter, W Hans', 'Ramakrishnan, Viswanathan', 'Murgo, Anthony J', 'Grant, Steven']","['Roberts JD', 'Smith MR', 'Feldman EJ', 'Cragg L', 'Millenson MM', 'Roboz GJ', 'Honeycutt C', 'Thune R', 'Padavic-Shaller K', 'Carter WH', 'Ramakrishnan V', 'Murgo AJ', 'Grant S']","['Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bryostatins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Macrolides/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2006/10/06 09:00,2006/11/11 09:00,['2006/10/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/19/5809 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2730 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 1;12(19):5809-16. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2730.,,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR 00065/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA 87056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The G protein Galphas subunit has been linked to proapoptotic processes in cancer cell lines. The TT genotype of the GNAS1 T393C polymorphism is associated with increased Galphas transcript levels and a more favorable clinical course in different solid cancers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively genotyped 144 patients with B-CLL to examine a potential association between T393C genotypes with progression-free survival (time from diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy) and overall survival. RESULTS: The C-allele frequency in the patient group was 0.57 and not significantly different from that of healthy blood donors. Median progression-free survival was significantly different between genotypes (TT 130 months; TC 100 months; CC 31 months; P = 0.0066). Multivariable analysis showed that besides of ZAP-70 (P = 0.005) and Binet stage (P < 0.001), the T393C polymorphism was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) CC versus TT 2.7; P = 0.010]. In Binet A stages, ZAP-70-positive patients with CC genotypes had a HR of 4.4 to receive first therapy compared with ZAP-70-negative patients with T-alleles (P = 0.0001). Regarding overall survival, CC genotypes (median overall survival, 197 months) were at highest risk for death compared with T-alleles (median overall survival, 310 months) in both univariate (HR, 4.8; P < 0.0001) and multivariable analysis (HR, 5.6; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that the GNAS1 T393C status is a novel independent prognostic marker in patients with B-CLL. These results could help to define patients who could benefit from an early individualized therapy.","['Frey, Ulrich H', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Sellmann, Ludger', 'Siemer, Dorte', 'Kuppers, Ralf', 'Durig, Jan', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Siffert, Winfried']","['Frey UH', 'Nuckel H', 'Sellmann L', 'Siemer D', 'Kuppers R', 'Durig J', 'Duhrsen U', 'Siffert W']","['Institut fur Pharmakogenetik, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.

We have previously shown that recruitment of marrow-derived vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1(+) (VEGFR-1(+)) proangiogenic hematopoietic progenitors contributes instructively and structurally to neoangiogenesis in mouse models. Here, we investigated whether stromal incorporation of CD68(+) hemangiogenic cells and alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) (alpha-SMA(+)) stromal cells correlates with neoangiogenesis and progression in human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Spatial localizations of vascular and stromal cells expressing CD34, VEGFR-1, alpha-SMA, and CD68 were examined by immunohistochemistry in 42 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), and compared with benign follicular hyperplasia. RESULTS: Compared with indolent lymphomas, there was a profound increase in recruitment of CD68(+) cells and VEGFR-1(+) neovessels in aggressive subtypes (including those transformed from indolent subtypes), where CD68(+) cells were localized to the perivascular region of neovessels as well as the stromal compartment. The perivascular CD68(+) cells expressed VEGFR-1 and VEGF-A. In contrast, there was a diffuse increase in alpha-SMA incorporation throughout the stromal compartment of indolent subtype of CLL/SLL compared with the scant perivascular pattern in aggressive subtypes. Overall, there was no correlation between CD34(+) microvessel density and lymphoma histologic subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Heightened stromal hemangiogenesis as marked by infiltration of proangiogenic VEGFR-1(+)CD68(+)VEGF-A(+) cells and their paracrine cross-talk with neovasculature appears to be a distinct feature of aggressive lymphoma, providing novel targets for antiangiogenic therapy, whereas alpha-SMA(+) stromal vascular network may be differentially targeted in CLL/SLL.","['Ruan, Jia', 'Hyjek, Elizabeth', 'Kermani, Pouneh', 'Christos, Paul J', 'Hooper, Andrea T', 'Coleman, Morton', 'Hempstead, Barbara', 'Leonard, John P', 'Chadburn, Amy', 'Rafii, Shahin']","['Ruan J', 'Hyjek E', 'Kermani P', 'Christos PJ', 'Hooper AT', 'Coleman M', 'Hempstead B', 'Leonard JP', 'Chadburn A', 'Rafii S']","['Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle, Smooth/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",2006/10/06 09:00,2006/11/11 09:00,['2006/10/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/19/5622 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1204 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 1;12(19):5622-31. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1204.,,,"['HL 075234/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59312/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 67839/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 RR 016814/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Towards this end, a strategy was devised to measure the rate of crossover of HIV-2 by evaluating recombinant progeny produced exclusively by heterodimeric virions. The results showed that HIV-2 exhibits a crossover rate similar to that of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus, indicating that the extremely high rate of crossover is a common retroviral feature.","['Mukherjee, Sayandip', 'Lee, Hui-Ling Rose', 'Ron, Yacov', 'Dougherty, Joseph P']","['Mukherjee S', 'Lee HL', 'Ron Y', 'Dougherty JP']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Microbiology and Immunology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Crossing Over, Genetic/*genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HIV-2/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Virion/*genetics']",2006/10/06 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/10/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01709-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01709-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Dec;80(24):12402-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01709-06.

Pathology shows membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) in most cases. After BMT, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) after resolution of MGN has not been reported. We describe a 13-year-old boy who had matched unrelated donor allogeneic BMT for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease. Nephrotic syndrome developed 1 year after BMT and renal biopsy revealed MGN. Immunosuppressive therapy achieved good clinical remission, and treatment was stopped after 15 months. He developed significant proteinuria 55 months later. The second renal biopsy showed FSGS without changes of MGN. This distinctive disease evolution gives inspiring implications. Complete morphological resolution of graft-versus-host disease-associated MGN, achieved in our case, has not been previously documented. Recurrent significant proteinuria after BMT is not necessarily due to previous renal lesion, and a repeat renal biopsy is indicated. The pathogenesis of MGN and FSGS are different, and different mechanisms of glomerular injury can interplay in a single patient after BMT. This case helps to expand our knowledge of the temporal morphological spectrum of renal lesions associated with BMT.","['Chan, Gavin Shueng-Wai', 'Chim, Stella', 'Fan, Yuen Shan', 'Chan, Kwok Wah']","['Chan GS', 'Chim S', 'Fan YS', 'Chan KW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. gavinchansw@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Glomerulonephritis, Membranous/*therapy', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/*etiology/pathology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Male', 'Proteinuria/etiology']",2006/10/06 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/10/06 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(06)00446-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2006.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2006 Dec;37(12):1607-10. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2006.07.011.

Secondarily, incorporation into RNA and inhibition of transcription has been shown in cell lines. As a single agent, fludarabine has been effective for indolent leukemia. Biochemical modulation strategies resulted in enhanced accumulation of cytarabine triphosphate and led to the use of fludarabine for the treatment of acute leukemia. The combination of fludarabine with DNA-damaging agents to inhibit DNA repair processes has been highly effective for indolent leukemia and lymphomas.

The incidence has been near stable over the last years. It continuously shows 2 peaks in occurrence in early childhood and later adulthood. With an incidence of 3.7 per 100,000 persons and an age-dependent mortality of 2.7 to nearly 18 per 100,000 persons, there is a rising awareness in the Western world of AML's special attributes resulting from an ever-aging population. To objectively describe epidemiologic data on this patient population, recent publications were evaluated to make transparent the current trends and facts. A review of the literature is presented, reflecting highlights of current research with respect to AML etiology. To estimate outcome and discuss informed treatment decisions with AML patients of different age groups and different biologic risk categories, it is mandatory to consider that the outcome results reported in clinical trials were until now heavily biased toward younger patients, whereas the overall dismal prognosis documented in population-based studies most likely reflects the exclusion of older patients from aggressive treatment. The etiology for most cases of AML is unclear, but a growing knowledge concerning leukemogenenic agents within chemotherapy regimens for other malignancies is already available. This includes specific associations of the most frequent balanced translocations in AML, including the ""good-risk"" abnormalities comprised by the core binding factor leukemias (i.e., AML with the translocation (8;21) and inversion of chromosome 16, and acute promyelocytic leukemia with the translocation (15;17)). In contrast to these genetic alterations, epigenetic lesions, e.g., promoter silencing by hypermethylation of the p15/INK4b and other genes, are increasingly recognized as important in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Deschler, Barbara', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Deschler B', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. deschler@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",2006/10/05 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22233 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Nov 1;107(9):2099-107. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22233.,,,,,89,,,['(c) 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

They may signal the onset of the accelerated phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or the blastic transformation of a myeloproliferative disorder. Occasionally, a GS may be the presenting sign of undiagnosed AML, and rarely the presenting sign of undiagnosed CML or aleukemic leukemia. Paraplegia due to a spinal cord GS is an extremely rare presentation of undiagnosed leukemia. This is the first case report of paraplegia as the presenting manifestation of extramedullary megakaryoblastic transformation of previously undiagnosed CML. A 53-year-old woman reported back pain for 6 days, rapidly progressing to paraplegia. Physical examination noted a large abdominal mass and flaccid paralysis in both lower extremities. Spinal MRI revealed a T4-T6 vertebral mass causing spinal stenosis and cord compression. Tumor debulking and laminectomy were performed emergently. The tumor consisted of noncohesive blast cells. The CBC revealed a leukocyte count of 238,300/microl and a differential consistent with CML. Reexamination of the patient found that the abdominal mass was a giant spleen. Further immunohistochemical studies of the tumor were consistent with extramedullary acute megakaryoblastic blast transformation of CML. Although extramedullary blast crises herald the accelerated phases in approximately 10% of CML cases, megakaryoblastic blast transformation of CML accounts for less than 3% of these cases. The combination of acute paraplegia and megakaryoblastic transformation in a previously undiagnosed patient with CML is extremely rare and may pose a diagnostic dilemma.","['Bryant, Barbara J', 'Alperin, Jack B', 'Elghetany, M Tarek']","['Bryant BJ', 'Alperin JB', 'Elghetany MT']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA. bryantb2@cc.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraplegia/complications/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Spinal Cord Compression/complications/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/secondary/therapy', 'Splenic Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/secondary/therapy']",2006/10/05 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20777 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2007 Feb;82(2):150-4. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20777.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This review provides an update, particularly for the newer clinical applications, and how therapeutic drug monitoring (including use of analytical and interpretation tools) can improve clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Improved drug assay methodologies and a greater understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms has allowed the use of therapeutic drug monitoring for immunosuppressant drugs in organ transplant recipients, antiretroviral agents for HIV/AIDS and antimetabolite drugs for leukaemia. In addition, new computer software to analyse drug concentrations in complex populations is being developed and introduced into routine clinical applications to allow increasingly patient-specific assay interpretation. SUMMARY: Therapeutic drug monitoring assists in improving clinical success rates and minimizing toxicity. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring is therefore likely to become more widespread as new modalities are adopted.","['Shenfield, Gillian M', 'Morris, Raymond G']","['Shenfield GM', 'Morris RG']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales 2065, Australia. gilshen@med.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,8813436,,,,2006/10/05 09:00,2006/10/05 09:01,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:01 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001503-200212000-00014 [pii]', '10.1097/00001503-200212000-00014 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Anaesthesiol. 2002 Dec;15(6):687-92. doi: 10.1097/00001503-200212000-00014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induced rates of tumors were 100-fold higher than those known for mouse specific locus mutations. There were clear strain differences in the types of naturally-occurring and induced tumors and most of the latter were malignant. Another important finding was that germ-line exposure elicited very weak tumorigenic responses, but caused persistent hypersensitivity in the offspring for the subsequent development of cancer by the postnatal environment. Activations of oncogenes, ras, mos, abl, etc. and mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as p53 were also detected in specific tumors in cancer-prone descendants. However, the majority of tumors observed in the progeny were those commonly observed in the strains that were used and oncogene activations were rarely observed in these tumors. It can be hypothesized that genetic instability modifies tumor occurrence in a transgenerational manner, but so far no links could be established between chromosomal and molecular changes and transmissible tumor risks. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that cumulative changes in many normal but cancer-related genes affecting immunological, biochemical and physiological functions may slightly elevate the incidence of tumors or fasten the tumor development. This hypothesis is supported by our GeneChip analyses which showed suppression and/or over-expression of many such genes in the offspring of mice exposed to radiation. In humans, a higher risk of leukemia and birth defects has been reported in the children of fathers who had been exposed to radionuclides in the nuclear reprocessing plants and to diagnostic radiation.

In the early days of transplantation the treatment was performed only in terminally ill patients but now transplantation is carried out early in the course of the disease with greatly improved results. The most common indications for treatment today include acute and chronic leukemia, Non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, Hodgkin s disease, multiple myeloma and congenital immune deficiencies. Sibling donors are the most common source of stem cells for transplantation but in recent years international donor registries have played an increasing role. Degree of HLA disparity between donor and recipient is the main risk factor for Graft versus Host disease which is still the major cause of morbidity and mortality after transplantation. Graft rejection is very rare when there is complete HLA match between the donor and recipient. Overall survival is also dependent on several other factors including disease stage at time of transplantation, age and disease categories. For the last few years an average of four Icelandic patients have received bone marrow transplantation each year and indicatioons are similar to other European countries.","['Reykdal, S E']",['Reykdal SE'],"['Division of haematology, Landspitali University Hospital, Hringbraut, 101 Reykjavik, Iceland. sigrunre@landspitali.is.']",['ice'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Iceland,Laeknabladid,Laeknabladid,7901326,,,,2006/10/05 09:00,2006/10/05 09:01,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:01 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Laeknabladid. 2000 Sep;86(9):593-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present pilot study we investigated a novel intensive chemo-immunotherapy approach for high-risk, fludarabine pretreated patients. Ten patients with resistant/relapsed, advanced stage BCLL were included. Age was 37-60 yr (median 53). All but one had an unmutated IgVH status. The treatment schedule included debulking with two DHAP courses followed by alemtuzumab (30 mg, eight doses), followed by peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization with intermediate/high-dose cyclophosphamide and by autografting after high-dose mitoxantrone+L-Pam. The DHAP-alemtuzumab combination was highly effective. Eight patients out of 10 responded to DHAP, with a single complete remission. Following alemtuzumab, the number of overall responses increased to nine, and the complete remissions to five. After alemtuzumab PB double-positive clonal CD5+/CD19+ lymphocytes dropped, with median purification rate 99.95%. Owing to poor PBPC mobilization, only five patients underwent autografting, and three of these experienced post-graft recurrence. The six patients entering complete remission were free of disease 3-23 mo after study entry, and three of them were still in remission at 3, 7, and 22 mo. However, molecular evaluation regularly revealed persistence of minimal residual disease, both in all PBPC collections tested and in post-treatment follow-up samples. The use of DHAP/alemtuzumab appears useful to re-induce disease remission in relapsed/refractory, high-risk B-CLL patients. However, the addition of autograft was not usually feasible and of questionable clinical use. Other strategies should thus be considered for remission maintenance.","['Majolino, Ignazio', 'Ladetto, Marco', 'Locasciulli, Anna', 'Drandi, Daniela', 'Benedetti, Fabio', 'Gallamini, Andrea', 'Chisesi, Teodoro', 'De Blasio, Angelo', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Tarella, Corrado']","['Majolino I', 'Ladetto M', 'Locasciulli A', 'Drandi D', 'Benedetti F', 'Gallamini A', 'Chisesi T', 'De Blasio A', 'Boccadoro M', 'Tarella C']","['UO Ematologia e TMO, Azienda Ospedaliera S.

We have previously reported that expression of the Bach2 transcription factor, which induces apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, is greatly reduced in CML cells. Because these cells are resistant to apoptosis, we tested whether Bach2 could also be regulated through posttranslational mechanisms that promote inhibition of the apoptotic response to mutagenic stimuli in CML. We found that Bach2 is phosphorylated on S521 via the phosphatidylinositol-3/S6 kinase pathway, and substitution of this site to alanine leads to nuclear accumulation of the protein, indicating that this phosphorylation is important for its subcellular localization. Ectopic expression of the S521 mutant imparts greater impairment to CML cell growth than the wild-type factor. Furthermore, we showed that Bach2 transcriptionally represses heme oxygenase-1, an antiapoptotic factor up-regulated in CML. Because CML cells are known to produce high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 resulting from inhibition of Bach2 activity may contribute to their genomic instability and leukemic phenotype.","['Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Yoshida, Fumiko', 'Sears, Daniel E', 'Hart, Stephen M', 'Ikebe, Dai', 'Muto, Akihiko', 'Basu, Subham', 'Igarashi, Kazuhiko', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Yoshida C', 'Yoshida F', 'Sears DE', 'Hart SM', 'Ikebe D', 'Muto A', 'Basu S', 'Igarashi K', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BACH2 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)']",IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/10/05 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52009-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-12-040972 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 1;109(3):1211-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-12-040972.

We characterized gamma-actin expression in antimicrotubule drug-resistant leukemia and examined the effect of altered gamma-actin in resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukemia to antimicrotubule agents. METHODS: Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were used to identify actin proteins in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines resistant to vinblastine (CCRF-CEM/VLB100 cells) and desoxyepothilone B (CCRF-CEM/dEpoB140 cells). Fluorescence-based cycle sequencing was used to detect gene mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutant gamma-actin expression plasmids, which were used to transfect mouse NIH/3T3 cells. Clonogenic analysis was used for drug sensitivity studies. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to block gamma-actin gene expression in human neuroblastoma SH-EP cells. Expression of gamma-actin (normalized to that of beta2-microglobulin [beta2M]) in primary leukemia cells obtained from patients at diagnosis (n = 44) and relapse (n = 25) was examined using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Statistical significance of changes in the ratio of gamma-actin to beta2M expression between diagnosis and relapse samples was determined by two-sided unpaired Student's t tests. RESULTS: We identified novel mutant forms of gamma-actin and the concomitant loss of wild-type gamma-actin in CCRF-CEM/VLB100 cells and CCRF-CEM/dEpoB140 cells. Mouse NIH/3T3 cells that expressed the mutant gamma-actin proteins were more resistant to antimicrotubule agents than cells transfected with empty plasmid. Human neuroblastoma SH-EP cells transfected with gamma-actin siRNA displayed higher relative resistance to paclitaxel (P<.001), vinblastine (P = .04), and epothilone B (P = .045) than mock-transfected cells. No gamma-actin gene mutations were identified in 37 samples of primary leukemia cells (eight from patients at diagnosis, 29 from patients at relapse). Gamma-actin gene expression was lower in acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples collected at clinical relapse (n = 25; mean gamma-actin/beta2M = 0.53) than in samples collected at diagnosis (n = 44; mean gamma-actin/beta2M = 0.68; difference = 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04 to 0.27, P = .01).

However, prognostic subsets within the CD56+ group have been difficult to identify due to the lack of uniform clinicopathological and immunophenotypical criteria. METHODS: A multicentre study was conducted by the Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer to define prognostic parameters and establish diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for CD56+ haematological neoplasms presenting primarily in the skin. RESULTS: Four different subtypes of lymphoproliferations with CD56 expression were identified: (1) haematodermic neoplasm; (2) skin infiltration as the first manifestation of CD56+ acute myeloid leukaemia; (3) nasal-type extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma; and (4) ""classical"" cases of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with co-expression of the CD56 molecule. Patients in the first three groups had a poor outcome (93% died) with a median survival rate of 11 months (95% CI 2-72 months), whereas all patients with CD56+ CTCL were alive at the last follow-up. CONCLUSION: Results show that CD56+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders, with the exception of CD56+ CTCL have a very poor prognosis. It is therefore clinically important to separate CD56+ CTCL from the remaining CD56+ haematological disorders.","['Assaf, Chalid', 'Gellrich, Sylke', 'Whittaker, Sean', 'Robson, Alistair', 'Cerroni, Lorenzo', 'Massone, Cesare', 'Kerl, Helmut', 'Rose, Christian', 'Chott, Andreas', 'Chimenti, Sergio', 'Hallermann, Christian', 'Petrella, Tony', 'Wechsler, Janine', 'Bagot, Martine', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Bullani-Kerl, Katrin', 'Bekkenk, Marcel W', 'Kempf, Werner', 'Meijer, Chris J L M', 'Willemze, Rein', 'Sterry, Wolfram']","['Assaf C', 'Gellrich S', 'Whittaker S', 'Robson A', 'Cerroni L', 'Massone C', 'Kerl H', 'Rose C', 'Chott A', 'Chimenti S', 'Hallermann C', 'Petrella T', 'Wechsler J', 'Bagot M', 'Hummel M', 'Bullani-Kerl K', 'Bekkenk MW', 'Kempf W', 'Meijer CJ', 'Willemze R', 'Sterry W']","['Department of Dermatology, Charite, Berlin, Germany. chalid.assaf@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prognosis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/10/05 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcp.2006.042135 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2006.042135 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2007 Sep;60(9):981-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2006.042135.

Among the Bcl-2 family, a BH3-only member, NOXA, functions in a specific mitochondrial-based cell death pathway when melanoma cells are exposed to a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib). Some therapeutic agents, such as bortezomib, not only induce proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and active conformational changes in Bak and Bax but also are associated with undesirable effects, including accumulation of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1. To enhance the bortezomib-mediated killing of melanoma cells, the apoptotic pathway involving NOXA was further investigated, leading to identification of an important target (i.e., the labile Bcl-2 homologue Mcl-1 but not other survival proteins). To reduce Mcl-1 levels, melanoma cells were pretreated with several different agents, including Mcl-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), UV light, or the purine nucleoside analogue fludarabine. By simultaneously triggering production of NOXA (using bortezomib) as well as reducing Mcl-1 levels (using siRNA, UV light, or fludarabine), significantly enhanced killing of melanoma cells was achieved. These results show binding interactions between distinct Bcl-2 family members, such as NOXA and Mcl-1, in melanoma cells, paving the way for novel and rational therapeutic combination strategies, which target guardians of the proapoptotic Bak- and Bax-mediated pathways, against this highly aggressive and often fatal malignancy.","['Qin, Jian-Zhong', 'Xin, Hong', 'Sitailo, Leonid A', 'Denning, Mitchell F', 'Nickoloff, Brian J']","['Qin JZ', 'Xin H', 'Sitailo LA', 'Denning MF', 'Nickoloff BJ']","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology/secondary', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2006/10/05 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/19/9636 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0747 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 1;66(19):9636-45. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0747.,,,"['CA 27502/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59327/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA083784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate its oncogenic potential, we engineered two transgenic mouse lines expressing p75 CDP/Cux under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat. The FVB strain of mouse is generally used in the generation of mouse models for breast cancer. The transgene was introduced into the hprt locus of 129/Ola embryonic stem cells and, following germ line passage, was backcrossed onto the FVB and C57BL/6 mouse strains. Here, we describe the phenotype of p75 CDP/Cux transgenic virgin female mice of the first backcross generations. We report that after a long latency period, approximately 33% of mice from two independent transgenic lines and from backcrosses into either the FVB or the C57BL/6 strains succumbed to a similar disease characterized by splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and frequent infiltration of leukocytes into nonhematopoietic organs like the kidneys and lungs. Although an excess of B or T cells was observed in three diseased mice, in 17 other cases, histologic and flow cytometry analyses revealed the expansion of a population of neutrophils in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow. The increase in neutrophils correlated with signs of anemia and thrombocytopenia, whereas there was no indication of a reactive process. Therefore, p75 CDP/Cux transgenic mice displayed heightened susceptibility to a disease defined as a myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia. These results indicate that the overexpression of p75 CDP/Cux could alter homeostasis in the hematopoietic compartment.","['Cadieux, Chantal', 'Fournier, Sylvie', 'Peterson, Alan C', 'Bedard, Christian', 'Bedell, Barry J', 'Nepveu, Alain']","['Cadieux C', 'Fournier S', 'Peterson AC', 'Bedard C', 'Bedell BJ', 'Nepveu A']","['Molecular Oncology Group, McGill University Health Center, Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CUX1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hepatomegaly/genetics/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Splenomegaly/genetics/pathology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription Factors']",2006/10/05 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/19/9492 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4230 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 1;66(19):9492-501. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4230.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Incident cases of childhood leukaemia (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, C91-C95, patients aged 0-14 years) for two almost equal calendar periods of diagnosis (1975-89 and 1990-2002) were selected from the Scottish Cancer Registry database and allocated to predetermined study areas, on the basis of proximity of residence to the Solway coast. Expected numbers of childhood leukaemia cases for the study areas were calculated by applying Scotland's age-specific, sex-specific and calendar period-specific rates to estimates of the person-years at risk in each study area. The ratios of observed to expected cases or standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated overall and for each sex and calendar period category. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the SIRs were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the observed number of cases of childhood leukaemia. RESULTS: No statistically significantly increased SIRs were found in boys, girls or both combined for any of the areas or periods of diagnosis studied. For the total period of observation (1975-2002), and the more immediate coastal area studied, the SIR for both sexes combined was 1.22 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.40). CONCLUSION: No statistically significant evidence was found of an excess risk of childhood leukaemia in the vicinity of the Solway Firth coast of Dumfries and Galloway Health Board area in Scotland.","['Stark, J M', 'Black, R J', 'Brewster, D H']","['Stark JM', 'Black RJ', 'Brewster DH']","['Scottish Cancer Registry, Information Services Division, NHS National Services Scotland, Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive/toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Power Plants', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scotland/epidemiology']",2006/10/05 09:00,2007/01/25 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['oem.2006.028829 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2006.028829 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2007 Jan;64(1):66-8. doi: 10.1136/oem.2006.028829.

This study analyzed the role of donor CMV serostatus and HLA-A2 status on leukemia outcomes in a large population of HLA-identical HCT recipients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Leukemia patients transplanted between 1992 and 2003 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center were categorized as standard risk [leukemia first remission, chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP)] and high risk (advanced disease) patients. Time-to-event analysis was used to evaluate the risk of relapse and death associated with HLA-A2 status and donor CMV serostatus. RESULTS: In standard risk patients, acute leukemia (p<0.001) and sex mismatch (female to male, p=0.004)) independently increased the risk of death, while acute leukemia increased the risk of relapse (p<0.001). In high risk patients acute leukemia (p=0.01), recipient age > or = 40 (p=0.005) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) seropositivity (p<0.001) significantly increased the risk death; HSV seropositivity (p=0.006) increased the risk of relapse. Donor CMV serostatus had no significant effect on mortality or relapse in any HLA group. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: This epidemiological study did not confirm the previously reported effect of donor CMV serostatus on the outcomes of leukemia in HLA-A2-identical HCT recipients. Addressing the question of cross-reactivity of HLA-A2-restricted CMV-specific T cells with minor H antigens in a clinical study would require knowledge of the patient's minor H antigen genotype. However, because of the unbalanced distribution of HLA-A2-restricted minor H antigens in the population and their incomplete identification, this question might be more appropriately evaluated in in vitro experiments than in a clinical study.","['Erard, Veronique', 'Guthrie, Katherine A', 'Riddell, Stanley', 'Boeckh, Michael']","['Erard V', 'Guthrie KA', 'Riddell S', 'Boeckh M']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cytomegalovirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*blood/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/trends', 'Histocompatibility Testing/trends', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood/epidemiology/genetics/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', '*Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/trends']",2006/10/05 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Oct;91(10):1377-83.,,,"['AI 053193/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study showed that AE2 protein expression was upregulated immediately after exposure to either low (0.5 micromol/l) or high (1 and 2 micromol/l) concentrations of arsenic trioxide. This suggests that arsenic trioxide may act via regulation of intracellular pH. Changing the culture pH in NB4 cells modulated the degradation of promyelocytic leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha), PML and RARalpha, which supported this hypothesis. DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid) inhibited AE2 function, preventing the arsenic trioxide-induced degradation of RARalpha and low concentration showed synergistic effects on the expression of CD11c, which is related with cell differentiation. In addition, DIDS rescued the cells from 1 micromol/l arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, AE2 mediated the action of arsenic trioxide via regulation of intracellular pH and a novel pathway for the mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is reported.","['Pan, Xiao-Yan', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Cai, Li', 'Buscemi, Stephen', 'Fu, Guo-Hui']","['Pan XY', 'Chen GQ', 'Cai L', 'Buscemi S', 'Fu GH']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Anion Transport Proteins)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antiporters)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (SLC4A Proteins)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Anion Transport Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antiporters/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'CD11c Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SLC4A Proteins']",2006/10/05 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6224 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06224.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Sep;134(5):491-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06224.x.,,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 2006 Dec;135(5):747'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these agents have revolutionized the current treatment modalities, while others are under investigation. Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) has been established as the gold standard of treatment for aggressive B-cell lymphomas in combination with CHOP and has shown significant activity as monotherapy in the treatment of indolent B-cell lymphomas. In follicular lymphomas the combination of Rituximab with chemotherapy improves the outcome compared to chemotherapy alone. CD 20-based radioimmunotherapy, with the advantage of the bystander effect, represents an additional therapeutic alternative in B-cell lymphomas and may produce tumor regression in Rituximab resistant patients. The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, alemtuzumab, further expands the armamentarium against lymphoid malignancies producing high response rates in these entities. Antibody-targeted chemotherapy such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, consisting of an anti-CD33 antibody combined to calicheamicin, has shown efficacy in the treatment of refractory acute myeloid leukemia; exact indications, timing and dosing schedule for optimized efficacy remain to be determined. Interferons have proven significant activity in cutaneous lymphomas, hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia by mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. Thalidomide, by acting as an immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic agent can modulate neoplastic cells microenvironment and lead to disease control in multiple myeloma as well as in numerous other hematological malignancies. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, displays significant anti-tumor activity, especially in multiple myeloma and lymphoproliferative disorders.

MDS is also a susceptibility to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and shown to be extremely resistant to current therapeutic strategies. MDS in a subset of 10-20% of patients arise after previous chemotherapy or radiation exposure for other malignancies. Because MDS is a heterogeneous disorder, specific gene abnormalities playing a role in the myelodysplastic process have been difficult to identify. Cytogenetic abnormalities are seen in half of MDS patients, and generally consist of partial or complete chromosome deletion or addition, whereas balanced translocations are rare. Genes more frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS remain unknown. Although point mutations of critical genes have been demonstrated to contribute to the development MDS, there was no strong correlation between these mutations and clinical features. Recently, we reported the high incidence of somatic mutations in the AML1/RUNX1 gene, which is a critical regulator of definitive hematopoiesis and the most frequent target for translocation of AML, in MDS, especially refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) and AML following MDS (defined here as MDS/AML). The MDS/AML patients with AML1 mutations had a significantly worse prognosis than those without AML1 mutations. Most of AML1/RUNX1 mutants lose trans-activation potential, which leads to a loss of AML1 function indicating that AML1/RUNX1 dysfunction is one of the major pathogenesis of MDS/AML. Normalizing AML1 function or regulating cooperative gene mutations would provide an important clue for molecular target therapies.","['Harada, Hironori', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Kimura, Akiro']","['Harada H', 'Harada Y', 'Kimura A']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan. herf1@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Gene Targeting/methods/trends', 'Genetic Therapy/methods/*trends', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*therapy']",2006/10/05 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/05 09:00'],"['2006/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156800906778194595 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2006 Sep;6(6):553-65. doi: 10.2174/156800906778194595.,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic effects of these quinones are mainly due to the following two factors: (i) inhibition of DNA topoisomerase-II and, (ii) formation of semiquinone radical that can transfer an electron to oxygen to produce super oxide, which is catalyzed by flavoenzymes such as NADPH-cytochrome-P-450 reductase. Both semiquinone and super oxide of quinones can generate the hydroxyl radical, which is the cause of DNA strand breaks. 1,4-naphthoquinone contains two quinone groups that have the ability to accept one or two electrons to form the corresponding radical anion or di-anion species. It is probably dependent on the quinone redox cycling that yields ""reactive oxygen species"" (ROS) as well as arylation reactions, which is common to quinones for biological relevance. In the present review, an attempt has been made to collect the cytotoxicity data on different series of 1,4-naphthoquinones against four different cancer cell lines that are L1210, A549, SNU-1, and K562, which were acquired by using identical method, and has been discussed in terms of QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationships) to understand the chemical-biological interactions.

This article summarizes findings of the WHO CRA project, presents the estimates of the International Labor Organization (ILO) for total deaths due to workplace risks, and calls for action. OBJECTIVES: Global burden estimates and counts of deaths assist ministers and other decision and policy makers to make informed decisions and to take action regarding risk reduction. METHODS: The WHO CRA methodology combined the proportions of the population exposed to five occupational hazards (excluding numerous risks due to inadequate global data) with relative risk measures to estimate attributable fractions of the selected health outcomes for both morbidity and mortality. ILO estimates of total numbers of global work-related injury deaths apply national fatality rates to employment data for the particular country; for disease deaths ILO uses an attributable risk approach. RESULTS: In 2000, the selected occupational risk factors were responsible worldwide for 37% of back pain, 16% of hearing loss, 13% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 11% of asthma, 8% of injuries, 9% of lung cancer and 2% of leukemia, and about 100% of pneumoconioses and mesothelioma. These selected risks at work resulted in the loss of about 24 million years of healthy life and caused 850,000 deaths worldwide, about 40% of the ILO estimate of 2.2 million total deaths.

Thirteen antigens with homology to known genes that are involved in critical cellular processes were detected. Further characterization of the 4 novel isoforms revealed that 3 (HECTD1Delta, CX-ORF-15Delta and hCAP-EDelta) had restricted mRNA expression in more than 70% of T-ALLs (n = 22) and that specific antibodies against these isoforms were detected in up to 30% of patients (n = 16), with the highest frequency for HECTD1Delta. The latter protein was present at high abundance in T-ALLs but not in normal hematopoietic tissues. Given that the leukemia-associated antigens detected in this study have an intracellular localization, the generation of immune effector responses most likely requires antigen presentation. To test this assumption, dendritic cells were loaded with HECTD1Delta protein and used for T cell stimulation. A specific T cell response was induced in vitro in all 3 healthy donors studied, including a former T-ALL patient.

SPC-2996, the company's most advanced product in development, entered an international, open-label, multicenter, phase I/II clinical trial in patients with severe chronic lymphocytic leukemia in May 2005. This trial is the first clinical evaluation of LNA chemistry. Two other LNA compounds have completed good laboratory practice safety studies with satisfactory outcome, and are likely to commence undergoing clinical development by 2007.","['Frieden, Miriam', 'Orum, Henrik']","['Frieden M', 'Orum H']","['Santaris Pharma A/S, Boge Alle 3, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark. mfr@santaris.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,IDrugs,IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,100883655,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'RNA/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering/therapeutic use']",2006/10/04 09:00,2007/07/04 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IDrugs. 2006 Oct;9(10):706-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which sodium butyrate induces apoptosis and the involvement of telomerase activity during apoptosis is not completely understood. To investigate the underlying pathways, sodium butyrate's potential to induce apoptosis in human leukemic U937 cells and its effects on telomerase activity were investigated. Exposure of U937 cells to sodium butyrate resulted in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as measured by hemocytometer counts, fluorescence microscopy, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis. The increase in apoptosis was associated with the up-regulation in pro-apoptotic Bax expression, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Sodium butyrate treatment also inhibited the levels of cIAP family members and induced the activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, sodium butyrate markedly inhibited the activity of telomerase and the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a main determinant of the telomerase enzymatic activity, was progressively down-regulated by sodium butyrate. Taken together, it is suggested that sodium butyrate can be a promising chemopreventive agent for leukemic cells and changes in Bcl-2 family expressions, as well as telomerase activity may, play critical roles in sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis in U937 cells.","['Choi, Yung Hyun']",['Choi YH'],"['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614-052, Korea. choiyh@deu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas Ligand Protein/analysis', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/analysis', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",2006/10/04 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 Nov;29(5):1207-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, vanillin itself exhibits very weak antiproliferative activity. We explored the effects of bromovanin (6-bromine-5-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde), a novel vanillin derivative, on survival and cell-cycle progression of human Jurkat leukemia cells. Treatment with >10 microM bromovanin significantly elicited apoptosis and G2/M arrest in Jurkat cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Bromovanin-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) were demonstrated by means of comet assay as well as detection of phosphorylated H2AX, a sensitive indicator of DNA DSBs. Immuno-hybridization analysis revealed that the cleavage of procaspase-3 and DNA-PKcs occurred concurrently with bromovanin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, phosphorylated Akt protein (Ser473), which is catalyzed by DNA-PKcs, as well as phosphorylated GSK3beta (a substrate of activated Akt), markedly decreased in bromovanin-treated Jurkat cells, suggesting that bromovanin leads to inactivation of Akt pathway via cleaving DNA-PKcs.

It is reported that Naf1 attenuates epidermal growth factor (EGF)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase2 (ERK2) nuclear signaling. Naf1 also binds to Nef, which plays a key role in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis and HIV-1 virus replication. Naf1 mRNA consists of 18 exons and multiple splice variants have been reported; two isoforms for exon 1, deletion of exon 2 and isoforms alpha and beta for exon 18. Using specimens from 29 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, we detected a high frequency of allelic loss on DNA at STS marker D5S2014 near the Naf1 gene. We therefore performed mutation and expression analyses using leukemia-lymphoma lines and 6 pairs of clinical AML samples. There was no mutation in the Naf1 coding region of any sample. As a result of expression analysis, we identified novel splice variants of the Naf1 gene; deletion of exon 16 (Naf1 alpha2, Naf1 beta2), deletion of exon 16 with an insertion (Naf1 alpha3, Naf1 beta3) and deletion of exons 16 and 17 (Naf1 alpha4). Naf1 alpha3 and beta3 showed premature termination. In peripheral blood mononucleocytes (PBMNCs) from healthy adults, almost no expression of full-length Naf1 (Naf1FL), Naf1 alpha3 and beta3 were observed. In contrast, their expression was clear in AML blasts and in the majority of leukemia-lymphoma lines investigated. Naf1 alpha2 was widely expressed in PBMNCs from healthy adults, AML blasts and cell lines, suggesting it is the main transcript of the Naf1 gene. Luciferase assay revealed that Naf1 alpha2 had equal NF-kappaB inhibitory effect to that of Naf1FL, while Naf1 alpha4 was less effective. In clinical AML patients, the expression of Naf1 alpha3 was much higher at diagnosis than on remission after chemotherapy, suggesting the possible dominant negative effect of Naf1 alpha3.","['Shiote, Yasuhiro', 'Ouchida, Mamoru', 'Jitsumori, Yoshimi', 'Ogama, Yoichiro', 'Matsuo, Yoshinobu', 'Ishimaru, Fumihiko', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Shimizu, Kenji']","['Shiote Y', 'Ouchida M', 'Jitsumori Y', 'Ogama Y', 'Matsuo Y', 'Ishimaru F', 'Tanimoto M', 'Shimizu K']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNIP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Alternative Splicing', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/10/04 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2006 Nov;18(5):917-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) KU812 and K562 cells show inhibited cellular proliferation in response to treatment with activin A, a member of TGF-beta superfamily. Apoptosis and erythroid differentiation can be induced in KU812 and K562 cells, respectively. We report herein that activin A induced the expression of p27KIP1 in CML cells along with the induction of cellular differentiation and apoptosis. There are putative binding sequences of erythroid-related transcription factor GATA-1 in the promoter region of the human p27KIP1 gene. Expression of GATA-1 protein in activin A-treated KU812 and K562 cells showed dissimilar regulation in these two cell lines. Induction of p27KIP1 was commonly observed, but it did not correspond to the expression levels of GATA-1 in either line of activin A-treated CML cells. In addition, ERK protein was rapidly and transiently activated with activin A in both types of CML cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of ERK is required for activin A signaling in CML cells. These results indicate that both p27KIP1 induction and regulation of GATA-1 play essential roles in activin A-induced erythroid differentiation and apoptosis.","['Fukuchi, Yumi', 'Yamato, Kenji', 'Kawamura, Chiharu', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Fukuchi Y', 'Yamato K', 'Kawamura C', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinanomachi, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Activins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",2006/10/04 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2006 Nov;16(5):1099-103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, low-dose TBI induces tumor growth delay, antimetastatic effects, suppressive effects on the incidence of spontaneous thymiclymphoma, sensitization of tumor to ionizing radiation, and decrease in TD50 value. In artificial metastasis, 0.20 Gy TBI suppressed lung metastasis when it was conducted between 3 h before and 3 h after tumor cell injection into a tail vein. In spontaneous metastasis, 0.15-0.20 Gy TBI suppressed lung metastasis. Irradiation with 0.15 Gy twice a week from 11 weeks of age for 40 weeks significantly suppressed the incidence of spontaneous thymic lymphoma in AKR/J mice, which caused prolonged life span. Low-dose TBI has been used in the clinical treatment of lymphomatous malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The usual practice was to give 0.1 Gy TBI three times a week or 0.15 Gy TBI two times a week to a total dose of 1.5 Gy. Despite this low total dose, low-dose fractionated TBI could induce long-term remissions and was as effective as the chemotherapy to which it was compared. Experimental data suggest that the antitumor effects of low-dose TBI could be explained by immune enhancement, induction of apoptosis, and intrinsic hypersensitivity to low-dose irradiation. Possible mechanisms of immune enhancement are elimination of the T-suppressor subset of lymphocytes and augmentation of the immune response including alteration of cytokine release and enhanced proliferative activity of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimuli.","['Hosoi, Yoshio']",['Hosoi Y'],"['Section of Radiation Biology, Center for Disease Biology and Integrative Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan. hosoi@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2006/10/04 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/yakushi/126.841 [pii]', '10.1248/yakushi.126.841 [doi]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2006 Oct;126(10):841-8. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.126.841.,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1) fusion in precursor-B (pre-B) ALL is the most common genetic rearrangement in childhood cancer; however, the cellular origin and the molecular pathogenesis of TEL-AML1-induced leukemia have not been identified. To study the origin of TEL-AML1-induced ALL, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing TEL-AML1 either ubiquitously or in lymphoid progenitors. TEL-AML1 expression in all lineages, but not lymphoid-restricted expression, led to progenitor cell expansion that evolved into oligoclonal B-lineage ALL in 3% of the transgenic zebrafish. This leukemia was transplantable to conditioned wild-type recipients. We demonstrate that TEL-AML1 induces a B cell differentiation arrest, and that leukemia development is associated with loss of TEL expression and elevated Bcl2/Bax ratio. The TEL-AML1 transgenic zebrafish models human pre-B ALL, identifies the molecular pathways associated with leukemia development, and serves as the foundation for subsequent genetic screens to identify modifiers and leukemia therapeutic targets.","['Sabaawy, Hatem E', 'Azuma, Mizuki', 'Embree, Lisa J', 'Tsai, Huai-Jen', 'Starost, Matthew F', 'Hickstein, Dennis D']","['Sabaawy HE', 'Azuma M', 'Embree LJ', 'Tsai HJ', 'Starost MF', 'Hickstein DD']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. sabaawyh@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Zebrafish/*genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis']",2006/10/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['0603349103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0603349103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 10;103(41):15166-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0603349103.

However, in vivo conditions of anti-HTLV-1 CTL before and after ATL development have yet to be determined. To characterize anti-HTLV-1 CTL in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (AC) and ATL patients, we analyzed the frequency and diversity of HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in PBMC of 35 AC and 32 ATL patients using 16 distinct epitopes of HTLV-1 Tax or Env/HLA tetramers along with intracellular cytolytic effector molecules (IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B). Overall frequency of subjects possessing Tax-specific CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in ATL than AC (53 vs 90%; p = 0.001), whereas the difference in Env-specific CD8+ T cells was not statistically significant. AC possessed Tax11-19/HLA-A*0201-specific tetramer+ cells by 90% and Tax301-309/HLA-A*2402-specific tetramer+ cells by 92%. Some AC recognized more than one epitope. In contrast, ATL recognized only Tax11-19 with HLA-A*0201 and Tax301-309 with HLA-A*2402 at frequencies of 30 and 55%. There were also significant differences in percentage of cells binding Tax11-19/HLA-A*0201 and Tax301-309/HLA-A*2402 tetramers between AC and ATL. Anti-HTLV-1 Tax CD8+ T cells in AC and ATL produced IFN-gamma in response to Tax. In contrast, perforin and granzyme B expression in anti-HTLV-1 CD8+ T cells of ATL was significant lower than that of AC. Frequency of Tax-specific CD8+ T cells in AC was related to proviral load in HLA-A*0201.

In the present work, we investigated the role of STATs in an IL-2-responsive human lymphoblastic lymphoma-derived cell line, YT. Only STAT3 was found constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated, but not other STATs. Hyperactive STAT3 was not attributable to a pre-existing intermediate affinity IL-2R complex and/or hyperactive Jak activity. Depletion of STAT3 protein expression reduced tumor cell viability with protracted kinetics (72-96 h), while TUNEL assays demonstrated cell death occurred via apoptosis. Interestingly, depletion of STAT5 in this same tumor induced more pronounced cell death compared with STAT3 depletion (24 h). Although IL-2 was able to rescue STAT3-depleted cells from death, it could not compensate for the loss of STAT5. To determine the prosurvival function of STAT3 vs STAT5 within the same tumor model, genes were profiled in STAT3- or STAT5-depleted YT cells by apoptosis-specific microarrays. Several differentially expressed genes were identified. Interestingly, those genes involved in NF-kappaB regulation, such as TNFR-associated factors 2 and 5 and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 10, were readily decreased upon STAT5, but not STAT3, depletion as validated by quantitative RT-PCR. These results suggest that STAT5 and, to a lesser extent, hyperactive STAT3 provide preferential and critical cell survival signals for certain human lymphoid tumors, indicating that nonhyperactive STATs should be considered as therapeutic targets for abrogating tumorigenesis.","['Nagy, Zsuzsanna S', 'Rui, Hallgeir', 'Stepkowski, Stanislaw M', 'Karras, James', 'Kirken, Robert A']","['Nagy ZS', 'Rui H', 'Stepkowski SM', 'Karras J', 'Kirken RA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas, El Paso, TX 79968, USA. znagy@utep.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/deficiency/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/deficiency/*physiology']",2006/10/04 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/8/5032 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.8.5032 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Oct 15;177(8):5032-40. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.8.5032.,,,"['5G12RR008124/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI053566/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI061052/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether type-2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2R), widely expressed in immune cells, also are modulated by MCD. We show that treatment of human DAUDI leukemia cells with MCD does not affect AEA binding to CB2R, and that receptor activation triggers similar [35S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding in MCD-treated and control cells, similar adenylate cyclase and MAPK activity, and similar MAPK-dependent protection against apoptosis. The other AEA-binding receptor transient receptor potential channel vanilloid receptor subunit 1, the AEA synthetase N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-phospholipase D, and the AEA hydrolase fatty acid amide hydrolase were not affected by MCD, whereas the AEA membrane transporter was inhibited (approximately 55%) compared with controls. Furthermore, neither diacylglycerol lipase nor monoacylglycerol lipase, which respectively synthesize and degrade 2-arachidonoylglycerol, were affected by MCD in DAUDI or C6 cells, whereas the transport of 2-arachidonoylglycerol was reduced to approximately 50%. Instead, membrane cholesterol enrichment almost doubled the uptake of AEA and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in both cell types. Finally, transfection experiments with human U937 immune cells, and the use of primary cells expressing CB1R or CB2R, ruled out that the cellular environment could account per se for the different modulation of CB receptor subtypes by MCD. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that lipid rafts control CB1R, but not CB2R, and endocannabinoid transport in immune and neuronal cells.","['Bari, Monica', 'Spagnuolo, Paola', 'Fezza, Filomena', 'Oddi, Sergio', 'Pasquariello, Nicoletta', 'Finazzi-Agro, Alessandro', 'Maccarrone, Mauro']","['Bari M', 'Spagnuolo P', 'Fezza F', 'Oddi S', 'Pasquariello N', 'Finazzi-Agro A', 'Maccarrone M']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Glycerides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/drug effects/*physiology', 'Metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'beta-Cyclodextrins/pharmacology']",2006/10/04 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/8/4971 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.8.4971 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Oct 15;177(8):4971-80. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.8.4971.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This trial compared the efficacy and toxicity of thioguanine (INN, thioguanine) versus mercaptopurine. METHODS: Consecutive children were randomized to receive thioguanine or mercaptopurine during maintenance chemotherapy. Toxicity data were collected by an adverse event-reporting system with follow-up questionnaires. Red blood cell thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity and thioguanine nucleotide concentrations were measured by standard techniques. RESULTS: Of the children, 748 were randomized to thioguanine and 744 were randomized to mercaptopurine. There was no difference in the event-free survival rate between the 2 groups (80% and 81%, respectively, at 5 years). Thioguanine was associated with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver in 95 children, and persistent splenomegaly as a result of portal hypertension developed in 43 children. TPMT activity was significantly lower in the children in whom VOD developed, with a median of 13.4 U (range, 5.8-23 U) compared with 15.2 U (range, 5.3-27) in a control group of 161 leukemia patients in whom VOD did not develop (median difference, 1.8 U; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.7 U; P = .0001). TPMT activity in children with persistent splenomegaly was also lower than that in control subjects (median difference, 1.6 U; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-2.8 U; P = .012). There was no difference in red blood cell thioguanine nucleotide concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Thioguanine was associated with liver damage in 11% of children randomized to thioguanine without an improvement in event-free survival rate. The association of lower TPMT activity with thioguanine-related liver damage could provide a means of identifying at-risk patients.","['Lennard, Lynne', 'Richards, Sue', 'Cartwright, Cher S', 'Mitchell, Chris', 'Lilleyman, John S', 'Vora, Ajay']","['Lennard L', 'Richards S', 'Cartwright CS', 'Mitchell C', 'Lilleyman JS', 'Vora A']","['Academic Unit of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.

In this report we describe a new murine Evi1 gene transcript (Delta105) that contains two alternatively spliced regions encoding a 9 amino acid insertion (Rp+9) within the repressor domain (Rp) and a 105 amino acid C-terminal truncation. Abundant levels of the 105 amino acid truncated protein are observed in murine leukaemia cells. The combined primary sequence alterations do not affect the DNA binding, transcriptional repressor or CtBP2 protein binding properties of Evi1 but they do reduce its transforming and cell proliferation stimulating activities. Reduced transforming activity is most likely due to the C-terminal truncation as the activity of Evi1 containing either Rp or Rp+9 is indistinguishable. Both isoforms exist in all murine tissues and cell lines examined. However, only the Rp+9 alternative splice variant is also found in humans and other vertebrates.

HCC is highly resistant to currently available chemotherapeutic drugs. Defects in apoptosis signaling contribute to this resistance. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family which interferes with mitochondrial activation. In a previous study we have shown that Mcl-1 is highly expressed in tissues of human HCC. In this study, we manipulated expression of the Mcl-1 protein in HCC cells by RNA interference and analyzed its impact on apoptosis sensitivity of HCC cells in vitro. METHODS: RNA interference was performed by transfecting siRNA to specifically knock down Mcl-1 expression in HCC cells. Mcl-1 expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Induction of apoptosis and caspase activity after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs and different targeted therapies were measured by flow cytometry and fluorometric analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that Mcl-1 expressing HCC cell lines show low sensitivity towards treatment with a panel of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, treatment with the anthracycline derivative epirubicin resulted in comparatively high apoptosis rates in HCC cells. Inhibition of the kinase PI3K significantly increased apoptosis induction by chemotherapy. RNA interference efficiently downregulated Mcl-1 expression in HCC cells. Mcl-1 downregulation sensitized HCC cells to different chemotherapeutic agents. Sensitization was accompanied by profound activation of caspase-3 and -9. In addition, Mcl-1 downregulation also increased apoptosis rates after treatment with PI3K inhibitors and, to a lower extent, after treatment with mTOR, Raf I and VEGF/PDGF kinase inhibitors. TRAIL-induced apoptosis did not markedly respond to Mcl-1 knockdown. Additionally, knockdown of Mcl-1 efficiently enhanced apoptosis sensitivity towards combined treatment modalities: Mcl-1 knockdown significantly augmented apoptosis sensitivity of HCC cells towards chemotherapy combined with PI3K inhibition. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that specific downregulation of Mcl-1 by RNA interference is a promising approach to sensitize HCC cells towards chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies.","['Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Fleischer, Binje', 'Schuchmann, Marcus', 'Weber, Achim', 'Weinmann, Arndt', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Galle, Peter R']","['Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Fleischer B', 'Schuchmann M', 'Weber A', 'Weinmann A', 'Krammer PH', 'Galle PR']","['First Department of Medicine, Johannes-Gutenberg-University Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55101 Mainz, Germany. bergkam@uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Interference/drug effects/*physiology']",2006/10/04 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/10/04 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-6-232 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-6-232 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2006 Oct 2;6:232. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-6-232.,20061002,,,PMC1601962,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggregation of Thy-1 in mast cells and basophils induces activation events independent of the expression of Fcepsilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI). Although we and others have previously suggested that plasma membrane microdomains called lipid rafts are implicated in both Thy-1 and FcepsilonRI signaling, properties of these microdomains are still poorly understood. In this study we used rat basophilic leukemia cells and their transfectants expressing both endogenous Thy-1.1 and exogenous Thy-1.2 genes and analyzed topography of the Thy-1 isoforms and Thy-1-induced signaling events. Light microscopy showed that both Thy-1 isoforms were in the plasma membrane distributed randomly and independently. Electron microscopy on isolated membrane sheets and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis indicated cross-talk between Thy-1 isoforms and between Thy-1 and FcepsilonRI. This cross-talk was dependent on actin filaments. Thy-1 aggregates colocalized with two transmembrane adaptor proteins, non-T cell activation linker (NTAL) and linker for activation of T cells (LAT), which had been shown to inhabit different membrane microdomains. Thy-1 aggregation led to tyrosine phosphorylation of these two adaptors. The combined data indicate that aggregated GPI-anchored proteins can attract different membrane proteins in different clusters and thus can trigger different signaling pathways.","['Heneberg, Petr', 'Lebduska, Pavel', ""Draberova, L'ubica"", 'Korb, Jan', 'Draber, Petr']","['Heneberg P', 'Lebduska P', 'Draberova L', 'Korb J', 'Draber P']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Lat protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Membrane Microdomains/*ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Thy-1 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2006/10/03 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200636159 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2006 Oct;36(10):2795-806. doi: 10.1002/eji.200636159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prior study showed that in vivo apoptosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) blasts in response to chemotherapy could occur through diverse pathways including both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study we investigated the apoptotic response in more detail by using a panel of ALL cell lines that differed in respect to p53 status. Upon exposure to a uniform stimulus, expression of apoptotic proteins, including the effector caspase-3, varied among ALL cell lines partly depending on p53 transcriptional activity and caspase-8 activation. Although the expression and contribution to apoptosis differed among known members of the apoptotic pathway, apoptosis was universally mediated by mitochondrial depolarization. The NFkappaB pathway was activated in response to chemotherapy but NFkappaB inhibition appeared to not influence chemosensitivity. This study further documents the highly variable nature of cell death programs in ALL and provides the foundation for cell death pathway modulation to improve ALL cure rates without increasing chemotherapy-related toxicity.","['Min, Dong-Joon', 'Moskowitz, Naomi P', 'Brownstein, Carrie', 'Lee, Hokyung', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Carroll, William L']","['Min DJ', 'Moskowitz NP', 'Brownstein C', 'Lee H', 'Horton TM', 'Carroll WL']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, The Stephen D.

Activation of the caspase 3, but not caspase 1, enzyme via inducing protein processing was detected in BE-induced apoptosis. The ROS-scavenging activity of BE was identified by the anti-DPPH radical, DCHF-DA, and in vitro plasmid digestion assay, and none of chemical antioxidants including allpurinol (ALL), N-acetyl-cystein (NAC), and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) affected BE-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. This suggests that apoptosis induced by BE is independent of the production of ROS in HL-60 cells. Interestingly, the apoptotic events such as DNA ladders formation and activation of the caspase 3 cascade were significantly blocked by TPA addition in the presence of membrane translocation of PKCalpha, and TPA-induced protection was reduced by adding the PKC inhibitors, GF-109203X and staurosporin. TPA addition induces the phosphorylation of JNKs and ERKs, but not p38, protein in HL-60 cells, and incubation of HL-60 cells with JNKs inhibitor SP600125, but not ERKs inhibitor, PD98059 or the p38 inhibitor SB203580, suppressed the protective effect of TPA against BE-induced apoptotic events including DNA ladders, apoptotic bodies, caspase 3 and D4-GDI protein cleavage in according with blocking JNKs protein phosphorylation. In addition, PKC inhibitor GF-109203X treatment blocks TPA-induced ERKs and JNKs protein phosphorylation, which indicates that activation of PKC locates at upstream of MAPKs activation in TPA-treated HL-60 cells. Additionally, a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential with a reduction in Bcl-2 protein expression, the induction of Bad protein phosphorylation, and translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol were observed in BE-treated HL-60 cells, and these events were prevented by the addition of TPA. GF-109203X and SP600125 suppression of TPA against cytochrome c release induced by BE was identified. This suggests that activation of PKC and JNKs participate in TPA's prevention of BE-induced apoptosis via suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction in HL-60 cells.","['Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Shen, Shing-Chuan', 'Wu, Chin-Yen', 'Chen, Yen-Chou']","['Chow JM', 'Shen SC', 'Wu CY', 'Chen YC']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taipei Municipal Wan-Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Glycosides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",2006/10/03 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-0085-x [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Nov;11(11):1999-2011. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-0085-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several investigations provided evidence demonstrating that unscheduled CDK1 activation may also be involved in apoptosis in cancerous cells. In this article, we demonstrate that X-ray irradiation induced G1 arrest in MOLT-4 lymphocytic leukemia cells, the arrest being accompanied by reduction in the activity of CDK2, but increased CDK1 activity and cell apoptosis in the G1 phase. Interestingly, this increase in CDK1 and apoptosis by ionizing radiation was prevented by pretreatment with the CDK1 inhibitor, roscovitine, suggesting that CDK1 kinase activity is required for radiation-induced apoptotic cell death in this model system. Furthermore, cyclin B1 and CDK1 were detected co-localizing and associating in G1 phase MOLT-4 cells, with the cellular lysates from these cells revealing a genotoxic stress-induced increase in CDK1 phosphorylation (Thr-161) and dephosphorylation (Tyr-15), as analyzed by postsorting immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Finally, X-irradiation was found to increase Bcl-2 phosphorylation in G1 phase cells. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that CDK1 is activated by unscheduled accumulation of cyclin B1 in G1 phase cells exposed to X-ray, and that CDK1 activation, at the wrong time and in the wrong phase, may directly or indirectly trigger a Bcl-2-dependent signaling pathway leading to apoptotic cell death in MOLT-4 cells.","['Wu, J', 'Feng, Y', 'Xie, D', 'Li, X', 'Xiao, W', 'Tao, D', 'Qin, J', 'Hu, J', 'Gardner, K', 'Judge, S I V', 'Li, Q Q', 'Gong, J']","['Wu J', 'Feng Y', 'Xie D', 'Li X', 'Xiao W', 'Tao D', 'Qin J', 'Hu J', 'Gardner K', 'Judge SI', 'Li QQ', 'Gong J']","['Cancer Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Central China University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",2006/10/03 09:00,2006/12/14 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00018-006-6138-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2006 Nov;63(21):2538-45. doi: 10.1007/s00018-006-6138-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, these results indicated that the extracts used in this study have anti tumor activity particularly against the leukemia cell lines and that apoptosis is the possible cause of cell death observed due to the extract of G. mite.","['Amirghofran, Z', 'Bahmani, M', 'Azadmehr, A', 'Javidnia, K']","['Amirghofran Z', 'Bahmani M', 'Azadmehr A', 'Javidnia K']","['Immunology Department and Autoimmune Disease Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Science, 71345-1798 Shiraz, Iran. amirghz@sums.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apiaceae/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galium/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Phytotherapy/*methods', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Stachys/chemistry']",2006/10/03 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2006;53(5):428-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These factors exert their hazardous potential in humans' personal (diet, smoking, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics) and occupational environment that constitute part of the anthropogenic environment. It is well known that genetic damage due to these factors has dramatic implications for human health. Since most of the environmental genotoxic factors induce arrest or delay in cell cycle progression, the conventional analysis of chromosomes at metaphase may underestimate their genotoxic potential. Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) induced either by means of cell fusion or specific chemicals, enables the microscopic visualization of interphase chromosomes whose morphology depends on the cell cycle stage, as well as the analysis of structural and numerical aberrations at the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The PCC has been successfully used in problems involving cell cycle analysis, diagnosis and prognosis of human leukaemia, assessment of interphase chromosome malformations resulting from exposure to radiation or chemicals, as well as elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the conversion of DNA damage into chromosomal damage. In this report, particular emphasis is given to the advantages of the PCC methodology used as an alternative to conventional metaphase analysis in answering questions in the fields of radiobiology, biological dosimetry, toxicogenetics, clinical cytogenetics and experimental therapeutics.","['Hatzi, Vasiliki I', 'Terzoudi, Georgia I', 'Paraskevopoulou, Christina', 'Makropoulos, Vasilios', 'Matthopoulos, Demetrios P', 'Pantelias, Gabriel E']","['Hatzi VI', 'Terzoudi GI', 'Paraskevopoulou C', 'Makropoulos V', 'Matthopoulos DP', 'Pantelias GE']","['Institute of Nuclear Technology and Radiation Protection, National Center for Scientific Research, NCSR Demokritos, Athens, Greece. vh@ipta.demokritos.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Environment', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism']",2006/10/03 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1100/tsw.2006.210 [doi]'],epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2006 Sep 25;6:1174-90. doi: 10.1100/tsw.2006.210.,20060925,,,PMC5917154,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rapid hematologic and cytogenetic response can be induced in the majority of people, even in advanced disease. However, complete eradication of malignant cells, which are characterized by the expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, is rare. Reasons for the persistence of the malignant clone are currently not known and provide a substantial challenge for clinicians and biologists. Based on a mathematical modeling approach that quantitatively explains a broad range of phenomena, we show for two independent datasets that clinically observed BCR-ABL1 transcript dynamics during imatinib treatment of CML can consistently be explained by a selective functional effect of imatinib on proliferative leukemia stem cells. Our results suggest the general potential of imatinib to induce a complete elimination of the malignant clone. Moreover, we predict that the therapeutic benefit of imatinib can, under certain circumstances, be accelerated by combination with proliferation-stimulating treatment strategies.","['Roeder, Ingo', 'Horn, Matthias', 'Glauche, Ingmar', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Mueller, Martin C', 'Loeffler, Markus']","['Roeder I', 'Horn M', 'Glauche I', 'Hochhaus A', 'Mueller MC', 'Loeffler M']","['Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, D-04107 Leipzig, Haertelstrasse 16-18, Germany. ingo.roeder@imise.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",2006/10/03 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1487 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1487 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2006 Oct;12(10):1181-4. doi: 10.1038/nm1487.

The natural history of CML is progression from a benign chronic phase, often through an accelerated phase, to a rapidly fatal blast crisis within 3-5 years. The constitutively activated ABL tyrosine kinase domain of the chimeric BCR-ABL oncoprotein is responsible for the transformation of hematopoietic stem cells and the symptoms of CML. Imatinib mesylate (Glivec), a specific small-molecule inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has become the standard drug therapy in all phases of the disease. Imatinib has greatly improved the outcome for patients with CML. Unfortunately, mutations causing resistance to imatinib are leading to relapse in some patients. Considerable progress has recently been made in understanding the structural biology of ABL and the molecular basis for resistance, facilitating the discovery and development of second- generation drugs designed to combat mutant forms of BCR-ABL. The first of these compounds to enter clinical development were dasatinib (BMS-354825) and AMN107 and, from phase I results, both of these promise a breakthrough in the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.","['Grzybowska-Izydorczyk, Olga', 'Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Grzybowska-Izydorczyk O', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Robak T']",['Katedra i Klinika Hematologii UM w Lodzi. ogrzybowska@o2.pl'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2006/10/03 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['9638 [pii]'],ppublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2006;60:490-7.,,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,Inhibitory kinaz tyrozynowych w terapii przewleklej bialaczki szpikowej.,,,,

The karyotypes of each patient and the French-American-British (FAB) criteria for the diagnosis of AML were reviewed. Chromosomal abnormalities were identified and classified according to ISCN 1995. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 53.6% of cases. Abnormalities were significantly more common in the FAB-M3 group (70.3%).

Over the past few years, submicroscopic deletions due to the loss of sequences proximal to chromosome 9 breakpoint or distal to chromosome 22 breakpoint have been found using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Among 150 CML bone marrow samples analyzed by molecular cytogenetics in our laboratory, 11 had a der(9) deletion detectable by FISH (deletion of the 5'ABL region and 3'BCR region in 10 samples and deletion of the 5'ABL region solely in 1 sample). To delineate the size of the deletions, FISH mapping was performed using 22 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), 11 on either side of the breakpoints, the mean distance between BACs being 0.5 Mb. The deletion size of the 5'ABL region on the der(9) extended from 2 to 5 Mb, the minimal deletion size being localized between BACs RP11-101E3 and RP11-83J21. In two patients, the deletion size of the 3'BCR region was about 500 kb (between RP11-80O7 and RP11-681C06). The poor prognosis associated with these deletions was postulated by several workers to be explained by haploinsufficiency of a tumor suppressor gene. However, in our cases, the hypothetical deletion of one or more tumor suppressor genes is not sufficient to explain the poor response to interferon therapy, but the good response to imatinib treatment. We think that there could be one or more genes coding for interferon receptors or for proteins acting directly or indirectly with these receptors in the deleted regions.","['Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Morel, Frederic', 'Quemener, Sylvia', 'Maguer, Aurelie', 'Le Bris, Marie-Josee', 'Morice, Patrick', 'Berthou, Christian', 'De Braekeleer, Marc']","['Douet-Guilbert N', 'Morel F', 'Quemener S', 'Maguer A', 'Le Bris MJ', 'Morice P', 'Berthou C', 'De Braekeleer M']","['Laboratory of Histology, Embryology and Cytogenetics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale (UBO), Brest, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics', '*Sequence Deletion']",2006/10/03 09:00,2006/12/19 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(06)00403-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2006.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2006 Oct 15;170(2):89-92. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2006.06.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene fusions leading to generation of aberrant fusion proteins or aberrant expression of normal proteins are a potent route to carcinogenesis and have recently emerged as attractive therapeutic targets. Intriguingly, although gene fusions have been widely observed in hematological malignancies, they have been far less frequently described in the more-common epithelial carcinomas. It has been recently proposed that technical issues, rather than any fundamental dichotomy between hematological and solid cancers, account for the under-representation of gene fusions in epithelial cancers. Recent reports from our group support this contention and provide evidence of widespread recurrent gene fusions in prostate cancer using a novel analysis of gene-expression profiles. Here, we provide an appraisal of the state of the knowledge of gene fusions in epithelial cancers. Future implications of gene fusions in common epithelial cancers are also discussed.","['Kumar-Sinha, Chandan', 'Tomlins, Scott A', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M']","['Kumar-Sinha C', 'Tomlins SA', 'Chinnaiyan AM']","['Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai 410208, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Trends Mol Med,Trends in molecular medicine,100966035,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Carcinoma/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics']",2006/10/03 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1471-4914(06)00215-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molmed.2006.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Mol Med. 2006 Nov;12(11):529-36. doi: 10.1016/j.molmed.2006.09.005.

STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the charts of 441 cancer survivors followed at a Canadian tertiary care pediatric hospital and calculated their most recent body mass index. We compared this cohort with population data generated from the Canadian Community Health Survey. RESULTS: At a median age of 14.7 years (range, 3.4 to 19.5 years) and a median time from diagnosis of 9.7 years (range, 3.4 to 19.2 years), 140 of 441 patients (31.7%) were overweight or obese. Only 12 of the 441 patients (2.7%) were underweight. Males age 6 to 11 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36 to 3.86; P < .001) and male survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.52; P = .04) were more likely to be overweight than the general population. No other age or diagnostic group had an increased risk of overweight. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight was not increased in this cohort compared with the general population.

At diagnosis, the plasma levels of the anti-angiogenic factor endostatin were significantly higher in 33 children with ALL than in controls (median values 17.7 and 7.6 ng/ml, respectively, p=0.0192) but no relationship was observed with plasma bFGF or VEGF levels. The highest levels were observed in patients with an hyperdiploid karyotype. Expression of mRNA for collagen XVIII/endostatin in lymphoblasts was detected in 19/24 cases but protein secretion was found only in 14/28 supernatants of cultured lymphoblasts. No direct relationship appeared between secretion of endostatin by lymphoblasts and plasma levels. In addition, endostatin levels remained elevated in remission, suggesting that endostatin could have a stromal origin as well. No prognostic value of plasma endostatin could be assessed.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical performance of Beckman Coulter's anti-HBs chemiluminescence immunoassay (Access AbHBsII). STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory performances were evaluated on 1207 routine samples pre-screened with Abbott Axsym anti-HBs assay and divided into three different panels: vaccinated subjects (n=232), subjects with resolved HBV infection (n=150) and negative subjects for anti-HBs (n=825). Sera with discrepant results were resolved by an alternative method and further chart review. RESULTS: The overall concordance between Access and Axsym assays was 95.8%. The relative sensitivity, relative specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 97.8%, 98.1%, 96%, and 99%, respectively. Of the 51 discrepant results, eight were false negative by Access, fifteen were false positive by Access, including sera from seven pregnant women, two patients with acute leukemia, and four with inflammatory syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: The Beckman Coulter's Access AbHBsII assay displays satisfactory relative sensitivity and specificity performances. The assay has good precision and reliability and is technically simple and fast.","['Motte, Anne', 'Colson, Philippe', 'Tamalet, Catherine']","['Motte A', 'Colson P', 'Tamalet C']","['Laboratoire de Virologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Timone et CNRS UMR 6020 IFR48, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)'],IM,"['Hepatitis B/*diagnosis', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*instrumentation/methods', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/10/03 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1386-6532(06)00283-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcv.2006.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2006 Nov;37(3):213-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2006.08.004.

In the present study drug sensitive L1210 and multidrug resistant L1210/VCR mouse leukemic cell lines were used as an experimental model. We found that LY 294,002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K/Akt kinase pathway, reduced the degree of vincristine resistance in L1210/VCR cells significantly and in a concentration-dependent manner. This was accompanied by decrease in IC(50) value to vincristine from 3.195+/-0.447 to 1.898+/-0.676 micromol/l for 2 micromol/l, to 0.947+/-0.419 micromol/l for 4 micromol/l, and to 0.478+/-0.202 micromol/l for 8 micromol/l LY294,002. The IC(50) value of sensitive cells for vincristine was about 0.010 micromol/l. FACS analysis of the proportion of cells in apoptosis or necrosis by annexin-V apoptosis kit showed the following: (i) vincristine-induced apoptosis in resistant cell to a much lower extent than in sensitive cells; (ii) LY294,002 alone did not induce apoptosis or necrosis in both sensitive and resistant cells; (iii) LY294,002 applied together with vincristine significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells. Transport activity of P-gp in resistant cells was monitored using calcein/AM as substrate and was depressed by LY294,002 in a concentration dependent manner. Significant differences in calcein retention were not observed when cells were preincubated with LY294,002 at different times from 0.5 to 24h. Sensitive and resistant cells contain similar amounts of uncleaved (i.e., unactivated) caspase-3 but in latter cells the activation of caspase-3 by proteolytic cleavage was decreased. The reversal of vincristine resistance by LY294,002 was associated with marked activation of caspase-3. Western blot analysis revealed that the development of MDR phenotype in L1210/VCR cells was also associated with increased level of Bcl-2 protein. All the above findings point to the possible involvement of PI3K/Akt kinase pathway in modulation of P-gp mediated multidrug resistance in L1210/VCR mouse leukemic cell line. MDR reversal effect of LY294,002 is accompanied with this compound's influence on vincristine-induced apoptosis.","['Barancik, Miroslav', 'Bohacova, Vierka', 'Sedlak, Jan', 'Sulova, Zdenka', 'Breier, Albert']","['Barancik M', 'Bohacova V', 'Sedlak J', 'Sulova Z', 'Breier A']","['Institute for Heart Research, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, PO Box 104, 840 05, Bratislava 45, Slovak Republic. usrdmiro@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Morpholines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2006/10/03 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0928-0987(06)00224-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2006.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2006 Dec;29(5):426-34. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2006.08.006.

The treatment of THP1 cells with recombinant Hsp70 in cell culture promoted repair by reducing the frequency of apurinic, apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA before and after 1.3 Gy of radiation. However, by 30 minutes after 2.6 Gy, accelerated repair of abasic sites supervened, which may contribute to the loss of the very-low-dose cell hypersensitivity seen in clonogenic studies of other laboratories. After irradiation with 2.6 Gy, the crucial initial glycosylase step was markedly incomplete when cells had been transfected 24 hours before with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to inhibit synthesis of Hsp70. In confirmation, lysates from irradiated siRNA-treated cells after 2.6 Gy were deficient in uracil glycosylase activity (UDG). Transfection with a scrambled RNA of the same size did not interfere with the glycosylase step, ie, the prompt conversion of damaged pyrimidine sites to abasic sites as well as the subsequent repair of those sites. BER measured by reduction of DNA AP sites before and after low-dose radiation was also deficient in THP1 cells that had been transfected with the siRNA designed to inhibit synthesis of Hsp70.

Immunization of mice with Hsp70 isolated from tumor tissues has been proved to elicit specific protective immunity against the original tumor challenge. In this work, we investigated whether Hsp70 can be used as vehicle to elicit immune response to its covalence-accompanying antigen. A recombinant protein expression vector was constructed that permitted the production of recombinant protein fusing tumor-associated antigen (eg, Mela) to the C terminus of Hsp70. We found that the Hsp70-Mela fusion protein can elicit strong cellular immune responses against murine tumor B16, which expresses protein Mela. The Hsp70 peptide-binding domain deletion mutant of the fusion protein was sufficient for inducing Mela-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte but was not sufficient for engendering potent anti-tumor immunity against B16. We also found that host natural killer (NK) cells were stimulated in vivo by C-terminal domain of Hsp70. We thus presume that Hsp70 fusion proteins suppress tumor growth via at least 2 distinct pathways: one is covalence-accompanying antigen dependent; another is antigen independent. The C-terminal domain of Hsp70 seemed to be the crucial part in eliciting antigen-independent responses, including NK cell stimulation, against tumor challenges. Furthermore, we found that immunization with multiple Hsp70 fusion proteins resulted in a better anti-tumor effect.","['Zhang, Honghai', 'Huang, Weida']","['Zhang H', 'Huang W']","[""Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/immunology/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology']",2006/10/03 09:00,2006/10/27 09:00,['2006/10/03 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1379/csc-191r.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2006 Autumn;11(3):216-26. doi: 10.1379/csc-191r.1.,,,,PMC1576472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Conditioned media from explant cultures of synovial tissue, periprosthetic soft tissue (interface membranes), titanium particles, and proinflammatory cytokines were used to stimulate fibroblasts. RNase protection assay was used to measure altered gene expression, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot hybridization, and flow cytometry were used to determine fibroblast protein expression. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining was used to identify multinucleated osteoclast-like cells. RESULTS: The most dominant compounds measured in the conditioned media from interface membranes were tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Fibroblasts phagocytosed particulate wear debris and responded to cytokine/chemokine stimulation. The most prominent up-regulated genes and proteins secreted by fibroblasts in response to stimulation were matrix metalloproteinase 1, MCP-1, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), COX-2, leukemia inhibitory factor 1, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), and TGFbeta receptor type I. In addition, interface membrane fibroblasts expressed RANKL and osteoprotegerin in response to stimulation with conditioned media, TNFalpha, or IL-1beta. Stimulated fibroblasts cocultured with bone marrow cells in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor induced osteoclastogenesis. CONCLUSION: Interface membrane fibroblasts respond directly to particulate wear debris, possibly via phagocytosis, expressing proinflammatory cytokines and RANKL. Thus, these cells may be actively involved in osteoclastogenesis and pathologic (periprosthetic) bone resorption.","['Koreny, Tamas', 'Tunyogi-Csapo, Miklos', 'Gal, Istvan', 'Vermes, Csaba', 'Jacobs, Joshua J', 'Glant, Tibor T']","['Koreny T', 'Tunyogi-Csapo M', 'Gal I', 'Vermes C', 'Jacobs JJ', 'Glant TT']","['Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'D1JT611TNE (Titanium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*adverse effects', 'Bone Resorption/genetics/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Knee Prosthesis/*adverse effects', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/pathology', 'Osteolysis/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Osteoprotegerin/genetics/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'RANK Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Titanium/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",2006/09/30 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.22134 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2006 Oct;54(10):3221-32. doi: 10.1002/art.22134.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since there are only a few detectable cells undergoing apoptosis in the joint, it is possible that a defect in apoptosis may contribute to synovial hyperplasia. This study sought to identify and characterize the direct role of apoptotic regulators in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: Using a serum transfer model, experimental arthritis was induced in mice lacking the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family genes Bak (Bak-/-), Bax (Bax-/-), or Bim (Bim-/-), as compared with wild-type (WT) control mice. Physical examination for edema of the ankles and histopathologic analysis of ankle sections were used to determine the severity of arthritis. The serum and ankles were examined for production of chemokines and cytokines using enzyme-linked immunosorbent or Luminex-based assays. RESULTS: Bim-/- mice displayed increased severity and prolongation of arthritis. In contrast, Bak-/- and Bax-/- mice showed no difference in the severity of arthritis as compared with WT mice. In addition, Bim-/- mice had elevated levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, decreased joint and serum production of antiinflammatory cytokines, fewer TUNEL-positive cells, and reduced levels of active caspase 3 as compared with WT mice. CONCLUSION: These studies are the first to demonstrate a role for the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bim in the effector phase of RA. The findings indicate that Bim potentially functions to repress the effector phase of arthritis by regulating the milieu of the joint and serum, and by inducing apoptosis.","['Scatizzi, John C', 'Bickel, Emily', 'Hutcheson, Jack', 'Haines, G Kenneth 3rd', 'Perlman, Harris']","['Scatizzi JC', 'Bickel E', 'Hutcheson J', 'Haines GK 3rd', 'Perlman H']","['Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ankle Joint/metabolism/*pathology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2006/09/30 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.22133 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2006 Oct;54(10):3182-93. doi: 10.1002/art.22133.,,,"['AR-02147/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-050250/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to characterize the expression, regulation, and function of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 in macrophages isolated from the joints of patients with RA. METHODS: Mononuclear cells were isolated from the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with RA. Mcl-1 expression was documented by intracellular staining of CD14+ cells using flow cytometry, and by real-time polymerase chain reaction or immunoblot analysis of isolated macrophages. The expression of Mcl-1 was suppressed with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chemical inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt-1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) pathways. Apoptosis was defined by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and by DNA fragmentation. RESULTS: The expression of Mcl-1 was increased in CD14+ macrophages from the SF of patients with RA compared with normal in vitro-differentiated macrophages. Inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt-1 or STAT-3 pathways significantly reduced the percentage of CD14+ cells within the SF and resulted in the reduction of Mcl-1 and the induction of apoptosis of synovial macrophages. Transfection of RA synovial macrophages with Mcl-1 siRNA resulted in apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION: Mcl-1 is critical for the survival of macrophages in the joints of patients with RA, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target in this disease.","['Liu, Hongtao', 'Huang, QiQuan', 'Shi, Bo', 'Eksarko, Polikseni', 'Temkin, Vladislav', 'Pope, Richard M']","['Liu H', 'Huang Q', 'Shi B', 'Eksarko P', 'Temkin V', 'Pope RM']","['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Sodium Salicylate/pharmacology', 'Synovial Membrane/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection']",2006/09/30 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.22132 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2006 Oct;54(10):3174-81. doi: 10.1002/art.22132.,,,"['AR-048269/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-049217/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since an impairment of anti-viral CD8+ T-lymphocyte function by imatinib has been described, we question whether imatinib also affects specific anti-leukemic CD8+ T lymphocytes generated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors, and of CML patients after allo-SCT. Here, we assessed CD8+ T-cell expansion and function from healthy donors and patients with CML. The release of IFN-gamma and granzyme B by CD8+ T-lymphocytes specific for R3, a recently described T-cell epitope peptide derived from a leukemia-associated antigen designated RHAMM/CD168 (receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility), was inhibited by imatinib in a dose-dependent fashion (range: 1-25 microM). These T cells were able to lyse cognate peptide labeled T2 cells and CD34+ CML progenitor cells. This lysis was inhibited by imatinib. The inhibitory effect was not associated with an increased rate of apoptosis of T cells and reversible after removal of imatinib. In the light of these findings, clinical administration of imatinib might result in the reduction of efficacy of the graft-versus-leukemia effect or other T-cell-based immunotherapies.","['Chen, Jinfei', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Rojewski, Markus', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'von Harsdorf, Stephanie', 'Greiner, Jochen', 'Guillaume, Philippe', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Chen J', 'Schmitt A', 'Chen B', 'Rojewski M', 'Ringhoffer M', 'von Harsdorf S', 'Greiner J', 'Guillaume P', 'Dohner H', 'Bunjes D', 'Schmitt M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University Ulm, Robert-Koch-Str 8, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Benzamides', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*immunology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*immunology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/06/06 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0232-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2007 Jun;56(6):849-61. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0232-9.

We had previously demonstrated an increased proapoptotic effect of imatinib (STI571) in combination with amifostine (AMI) in K562 cell line. In this study, we used genomic scale gene expression profiling to monitor changes at transcriptional level in K562 cells during the treatment with AMI + STI571. MATERIALS AND METHODS: cRNA from Control and treated K562 cells were mixed in equal amounts and incubated with a microarray slide for hybridization. RNA from six independent paired experiments was subjected to transcriptional profiling. With the aim to automate the process of biological theme determination, selected genes were further analyzed by EASE. Validation of the expression was carried out by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: As expected, a small percentage of genes accounts for the effects of the combined drug treatment. We identified 61 sequences corresponding to known genes; 17 of the 61 genes were up regulated, such as RHO6, PPP2R5E, PPM1E and BTF that appear to reflect favorable events for apoptosis induction. Between down regulated genes, API5, TUBB2 and TLK1 are also of considerable interest. CONCLUSION: We identified a transcriptional repressor of survival genes, known as BTF, which triggers a proapoptotic signal, potentially helpful to overcome the resistance to STI571. This finding could be particularly useful to design novel therapeutic strategies for leukemia patients. This study demonstrates the importance of in vitro testing of a novel drug combination most likely to predict its potential usefulness for in vivo application.","['Bianchini, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Renzulli, Matteo', 'Gonzalez Cid, Marcela', 'Larripa, Irene']","['Bianchini M', 'Martinelli G', 'Renzulli M', 'Gonzalez Cid M', 'Larripa I']","['Departamento de Genetica, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas Mariano R.

Importantly, the ML1 and ML2 AML cell lines are derived from an AML relapse in a patient initially diagnosed with T-ALL.

We investigated the thyroid gland morphology and the function of the pituitary-thyroid axis in a group of patients treated for ALL in childhood. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted at a tertiary medical center. Thirty-three children (22 males and 11 females; age: 11.9+/-3 years; range: 6 to 18 years) were studied. The mean age at the time of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (12-24 Gy) was 5.5+/-2.6 years (range: 1 to 14 years). The average length of the follow-up was 6.1+/-3 years (range: 2 to 12 years). Thyroid morphology (n=33) was evaluated by palpation and ultrasonography. Thyroid function (n=30) was evaluated measuring total T3 and T4, and by the thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) test. Prolactin secretion was assessed before and after injection of TRH to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy. RESULTS: One out of the 33 children (3%) was found to have a papillary carcinoma of thyroid four years after ALL treatment. Thyroid function was normal in all the patients, however one case (3%) showed high TSH (9.2 microU/mL) and prolactin (37.5 ng/mL) basal levels, but normal responses to TRH (TSH = 17.8 microU/mL; prolactin = 82.3 ng/mL). These hormonal alteration were not confirmed at follow-up: TSH = 1.6 microU/mL and prolactin = 13.7 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, the treatment of ALL was associated with one case of thyroid carcinoma, but it did not produce adverse effect on the thyroid function, at least after a follow-up lasted on average 6 years.","['Neves Mascarenhas, A', 'Papadia, C', 'Alves Aquino, C', 'Oba, L', 'Ferreira, M', 'Casulari, L A']","['Neves Mascarenhas A', 'Papadia C', 'Alves Aquino C', 'Oba L', 'Ferreira M', 'Casulari LA']","['Endocrinology Service, Hospital Regional da Asa Norte, Brasilia, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,"['06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '5Y5F15120W (Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/*blood/*etiology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*blood/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Thyroid Gland/*drug effects/pathology/physiopathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*blood/*etiology', 'Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Thyroxine/*blood', 'Triiodothyronine/*blood']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Pediatr. 2006 Oct;58(5):469-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro experiments and phase I and II trials have shown that phytochemicals such as perillyl alcohol (P-OH) have antitumor effects. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a synthetic methylxanthine used mainly to treat pathologies associated with hematological diseases, sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether PTX amplifies the antitumor effects of P-OH in U937 human myelomonocytic leukemia cells. METHODS: Apoptosis was measured by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential determined by flow cytometry using dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) and propidium iodide. Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression was also assessed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: P-OH and PTX induced loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential in U937 cells in vitro. Culturing the cells in the presence of both compounds caused a significant increase (p < 0.001) in apoptosis and expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax proteins. However, despite their coexistence, Bax expression prevailed in our experiments. These data suggest that the effects of PTX might be attributable to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential. CONCLUSION: PTX sensitizes tumor cells to the anti-neoplastic action of P-OH. These observations may have clinical relevance in the treatment of cancer patients.","['Gomez-Contreras, P C', 'Hernandez-Flores, G', 'Ortiz-Lazareno, P C', 'Del Toro-Arreola, S', 'Delgado-Rizo, V', 'Lerma-Diaz, J M', 'Barba-Barajas, M', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez, J R', 'Bravo Cuellar, A']","['Gomez-Contreras PC', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Ortiz-Lazareno PC', 'Del Toro-Arreola S', 'Delgado-Rizo V', 'Lerma-Diaz JM', 'Barba-Barajas M', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez JR', 'Bravo Cuellar A']","['Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Guadalajara, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '319R5C7293 (perillyl alcohol)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Monoterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pentoxifylline/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/02/14 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['96003 [pii]', '10.1159/000096003 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2006;52(6):308-15. doi: 10.1159/000096003.

The aim of this study was to identify neurological conditions with low CNS IGF-1. METHODS: Levels of CSF IGF-1 were determined by radio-immunoassay (Mediagnost, Tubingen, Germany). RESULTS: Levels of CSF IGF-1 were low in some progressive diseases of white matter and the cerebellum. In some other diseases not involving cerebellum or white matter, CSF IGF-1 was normal.

Other studies suggest that patients may acquire chromosome abnormalities during the course of their disease. There are minimal prospective data on the clinical utility of the widely used hierarchical FISH prognostic categories in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage CLL or the frequency of clonal evolution as determined by interphase FISH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1994 and 2002, we enrolled 159 patients with previously untreated CLL (83% Rai stage 0/I) on a prospective trial evaluating clonal evolution by FISH. Patients provided baseline and follow-up specimens for FISH testing during 2 to 12 years. RESULTS: Chromosomal abnormalities detected by FISH at study entry predicted overall survival. Eighteen patients experienced clonal evolution during follow-up. The rate of clonal evolution increased with duration of follow-up with only one occurrence in the first 2 years (n = 71; 1.4%) but 17 occurrences (n = 63; 27%) among patients tested after 5+ years. Clonal evolution occurred among 10% of ZAP-70-negative and 42% of ZAP-70-positive patients at 5+ years (P = .008). CONCLUSION: This clinical trial confirms prospectively that cytogenetic abnormalities detected by FISH can predict overall survival for CLL patients at the time of diagnosis, but also suggests that many patients acquire new abnormalities during the course of their disease. Patients with higher ZAP-70 expression may be more likely to experience such clonal evolution. These findings have important implications for both clinical management and trials of early treatment for patients with high-risk, early-stage CLL.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Fink, Stephanie R', 'Jenkins, Robert B', 'Paternoster, Sarah F', 'Smoley, Stephanie A', 'Stockero, Kimberly J', 'Nast, Danielle M', 'Flynn, Heather C', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Geyer, Susan', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Call, Tim G', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Dewald, Gordon W']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Witzig TE', 'Fink SR', 'Jenkins RB', 'Paternoster SF', 'Smoley SA', 'Stockero KJ', 'Nast DM', 'Flynn HC', 'Tschumper RC', 'Geyer S', 'Zent CS', 'Call TG', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE', 'Dewald GW']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis']",2006/09/30 09:00,2006/10/26 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/28/4634 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.06.9492 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Oct 1;24(28):4634-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.9492.,,,"['CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA90628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine the processes and document the calendar time required to activate such studies opened by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). METHODS: Setup steps were documented by (1) interviewing CALGB headquarters and statistical center staff and committee chairs to discover the steps required to transit from concept development to final study activation, (2) reviewing procedure manuals, and (3) inspecting all study records, documents, and e-mails to identify any additional steps. Calendar time was collected for each major process. RESULTS: Thirteen phase III studies were activated by CALGB during the study period of May 2002 to May 2005. More than 370 distinct processes were required for study activation: 317 work steps, 42 decision points, and 29 processing loops. Sixty-three percent of the decision points were outside CALGB.

However, resistance to imatinib develops frequently, particularly in late-stage disease. To identify new cellular BCR-ABL downstream targets, we analyzed differences in global protein expression in BCR-ABL-positive K562 cells treated with or without imatinib in vitro. Among the 19 proteins found to be differentially expressed, we detected the down-regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), a protein essential for cell proliferation. eIF5A represents the only known eukaryotic protein activated by posttranslational hypusination. Hypusination inhibitors (HIs) alone exerted an antiproliferative effect on BCR-ABL-positive and -negative leukemia cell lines in vitro. However, the synergistic dose-response relationship found for the combination of imatinib and HI was restricted to Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Furthermore, this synergistic effect was confirmed by cytotoxicity assays, cell-cycle analysis, and CFSE labeling of primary CD34+ CML cells. Specificity of this effect could be demonstrated by cotreatment of K562 cells with imatinib and siRNA against eIF5. In conclusion, through a comparative proteomics approach and further functional analysis, we identified the inhibition of eIF5A hypusination as a promising new approach for combination therapy in BCR-ABL-positive leukemias.","['Balabanov, Stefan', 'Gontarewicz, Artur', 'Ziegler, Patrick', 'Hartmann, Ulrike', 'Kammer, Winfried', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Brassat, Ute', 'Priemer, Martin', 'Hauber, Ilona', 'Wilhelm, Thomas', 'Schwarz, Gerold', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Hauber, Joachim', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Nordheim, Alfred', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Balabanov S', 'Gontarewicz A', 'Ziegler P', 'Hartmann U', 'Kammer W', 'Copland M', 'Brassat U', 'Priemer M', 'Hauber I', 'Wilhelm T', 'Schwarz G', 'Kanz L', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Hauber J', 'Holyoake TL', 'Nordheim A', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)', '3874VXF092 (hypusine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Synergism', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lysine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42015-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-03-037648 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 15;109(4):1701-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-037648.

Because of the highly regulated nature of the cell cycle, it seems likely that variation in gene dosage of key components due to functional regulatory polymorphisms could play an important role in cancer development. Here we provide evidence of the involvement of promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (pSNPs) in the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN1A, and CDKN1B in the etiology of childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A case-control study, conducted in 240 patients with pre-B ALL and 277 healthy controls, combined with a family-based analysis using 135 parental trios, all of French-Canadian origin, were used to evaluate single-site genotypic as well as multilocus haplotypic associations for a total of 10 pSNPs.

These findings suggest that variable expression levels of cell-cycle inhibitor genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN1B due to regulatory polymorphisms could indeed influence the risk of childhood pre-B ALL and contribute to carcinogenesis.","['Healy, Jasmine', 'Belanger, Helene', 'Beaulieu, Patrick', 'Lariviere, Mathieu', 'Labuda, Damian', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Healy J', 'Belanger H', 'Beaulieu P', 'Lariviere M', 'Labuda D', 'Sinnett D']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Centre, Centro Hospitalo-Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3T 1C5.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'S Phase']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52080-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-02-003236 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 15;109(2):683-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-02-003236.

CD33 contains a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which can recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2. How CD33 expression is regulated is unclear. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is expressed in response to cytokines, LPS, and other PAMPs, and competes with SHP-1/2 binding to ITIMs of cytokine receptors, thereby inhibiting signaling. In this study, using peptide pull-down experiments, we found that SOCS3 can specifically bind to the phosphorylated ITIM of CD33. Additionally, following cross-linking SOCS3 can recruit the ECS E3 ligase resulting in accelerated proteasomal degradation of both CD33 and SOCS3. Our data suggest that the tyrosine motifs in CD33 are not important for internalization, while they are required for degradation. Moreover, SOCS3 inhibited the CD33-induced block on cytokine-induced proliferation. This is the first receptor shown to be degraded by SOCS3 and where SOCS3 and its target protein are degraded concomitantly. Our findings clearly suggest that during an inflammatory response, the inhibitory receptor CD33 is lost by this mechanism. Moreover, this has important clinical implications as tumors expressing SOCS3 may be refractory to alpha-CD33 therapy.","['Orr, Selinda J', 'Morgan, Nuala M', 'Elliott, Joanne', 'Burrows, James F', 'Scott, Christopher J', 'McVicar, Daniel W', 'Johnston, James A']","['Orr SJ', 'Morgan NM', 'Elliott J', 'Burrows JF', 'Scott CJ', 'McVicar DW', 'Johnston JA']","['Infection and Immunity, centre for Cancer Research and Biology, Queens University, Belfast, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51991-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-023556 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 1;109(3):1061-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-023556.

NPM1 mutations occur in 50% to 60% of adult acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype (AML-NK) and generate NPM mutants that localize aberrantly in the leukemic-cell cytoplasm, hence the term NPM-cytoplasmic positive (NPMc+ AML). Cytoplasmic NPM accumulation is caused by the concerted action of 2 alterations at mutant C-terminus, that is, changes of tryptophan(s) 288 and 290 (or only 290) and creation of an additional nuclear export signal (NES) motif. NPMc+ AML shows increased frequency in adults and females, wide morphologic spectrum, multilineage involvement, high frequency of FLT3-ITD, CD34 negativity, and a distinct gene-expression profile. Analysis of mutated NPM has important clinical and pathologic applications. Immunohistochemical detection of cytoplasmic NPM predicts NPM1 mutations and helps rationalize cytogenetic/molecular studies in AML. NPM1 mutations in absence of FLT3-ITD identify a prognostically favorable subgroup in the heterogeneous AML-NK category. Due to their frequency and stability, NPM1 mutations may become a new tool for monitoring minimal residual disease in AML-NK. Future studies should focus on clarifying how NPM mutants promote leukemia, integrating NPMc+ AML in the upcoming World Health Organization leukemia classification, and eventually developing specific antileukemic drugs.","['Falini, Brunangelo', 'Nicoletti, Ildo', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['Falini B', 'Nicoletti I', 'Martelli MF', 'Mecucci C']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Italy. faliniem@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Acute Disease', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51968-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-012252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 1;109(3):874-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-012252.

This suggests a higher incidence of childhood cancer among children of older parents. A population-based cohort study of parental ages and other prenatal risk factors for five main childhood cancers was performed with the use of a linkage between several national-based registries. METHODS: In total, about 4.3 million children with their parents, born between 1961 and 2000, were included in the study. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to obtain the incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Children <5 years of age and children 5-14 years of age were analysed independently. RESULTS: There was no significant result for children 5-14 years of age. For children <5 years of age, maternal age were associated with elevated risk of retinoblastoma (oldest age group's IRR = 2.39, 95%CI = 1.17-4.85) and leukaemia (oldest age group's IRR = 1.44, 95%CI = 1.01-2.05). Paternal age was significantly associated with leukaemia (oldest age group's IRR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.04-1.66). For central nervous system cancer, the effect of paternal age was found to be significant (oldest age group's IRR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.21-2.35) when maternal age was included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that advanced parental age might be associated with an increased risk of early childhood cancers.","['Yip, Benjamin H', 'Pawitan, Yudi', 'Czene, Kamila']","['Yip BH', 'Pawitan Y', 'Czene K']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', '*Maternal Age', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Paternal Age', 'Population Surveillance/methods', 'Retinal Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Wilms Tumor/epidemiology/etiology']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyl177 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyl177 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2006 Dec;35(6):1495-503. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyl177.

The virus has evolved strategies to escape immune clearance by remaining latent in most infected cells in vivo. We demonstrated previously that virally encoded p30 protein is a potent post-transcriptional inhibitor of virus replication (Nicot, C., Dundr, M., Johnson, J. M., Fullen, J. R., Alonzo, N., Fukumoto, R., Princler, G. L., Derse, D., Misteli, T., and Franchini, G. (2004) Nat. Med. 10, 197-201). p30 is unable to shuttle out of the nucleus in heterokaryon assays, suggesting the existence of specific retention signals. Because suppression of virus replication relies on nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA by p30, determining the retention features of p30 will offer hints to break latency in infected cells and insights into new therapeutic approaches. In this study, we used live cell imaging technologies to study the kinetics of p30 and to delineate its retention signals and their function in virus replication. Notably, this is the first study to identify p30 nucleolar retention domains. Using mutants of p30 that localized in different cellular compartments, we show that post-transcriptional control of virus replication by p30 occurs in the nucleoplasm. We further demonstrate that p30 nuclear/nucleolar retention is dependent upon de novo RNA transcripts and interactions with components of the ribosomal machinery.","['Ghorbel, Sofiane', 'Sinha-Datta, Uma', 'Dundr, Miroslav', 'Brown, Megan', 'Franchini, Genoveffa', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Ghorbel S', 'Sinha-Datta U', 'Dundr M', 'Brown M', 'Franchini G', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics, and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160-7420, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleolus/*virology', 'Cell Nucleus/*virology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA/*chemistry', 'Ribosomes/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)72064-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M603981200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 1;281(48):37150-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M603981200.

Manp localized exclusively in the nucleus and could redirect Mlf1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The nuclear content of Mlf1 was also regulated by 14-3-3 binding to a canonical 14-3-3 binding motif within the N terminus of Mlf1. Significantly Mlf1 contains a functional nuclear export signal and localized primarily to the nuclei of hemopoietic cells. Mlf1 was capable of binding DNA, and microarray analysis revealed that it affected the expression of several genes, including transcription factors. In summary, this study reveals that Mlf1 translocates between nucleus and cytoplasm, associates with a novel hnRNP, and influences gene expression.","['Winteringham, Louise N', 'Endersby, Raelene', 'Kobelke, Simon', 'McCulloch, Ross K', 'Williams, James H', 'Stillitano, Justin', 'Cornwall, Scott M', 'Ingley, Evan', 'Klinken, S Peter']","['Winteringham LN', 'Endersby R', 'Kobelke S', 'McCulloch RK', 'Williams JH', 'Stillitano J', 'Cornwall SM', 'Ingley E', 'Klinken SP']","['Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6000, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U)', '0 (Mlf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)71872-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M605401200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 15;281(50):38791-800. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M605401200.

The obstetric records of 2692 mothers of children diagnosed with cancer and 4864 mothers of children without cancer were available for analysis. Overall, 1754 (65%) case mothers and 3220 (66%) control mothers had at least one prior pregnancy before the birth of the index child. Of these, 12 (0.68%) of the former and 9 (0.28%) of the latter had a prior molar pregnancy (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1 - 6.1). Both childhood cancer and molar pregnancy are rare neoplastic events, and the numbers are small. Nonetheless, whilst the associations were strongest for common precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.9 - 14.7) and sarcoma (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.3 - 30.3), the spread across the remaining diagnostic groups suggests that the relationship, if confirmed, may be of a generalized, rather than specific, type. This is the first time that an association between childhood cancer and hydatidiform mole has been reported. The UKCCS's systematic use of clinical records permitted a more precise characterization of reproductive events than is possible in investigations that rely on individuals own accounts, and we are confident that our findings cannot be explained by recall bias or other methodological limitations. Accordingly, we suggest that there may be an aetiologic connection between molar pregnancy and childhood cancer, and speculate here on the various genetic/epigenetic mechanisms that could be involved.","['Roman, Eve', 'Doyle, Pat', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Ansell, Pat', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Allan, James M', 'Kinsey, Sally', 'Eden, Tim O']","['Roman E', 'Doyle P', 'Lightfoot T', 'Ansell P', 'Simpson J', 'Allan JM', 'Kinsey S', 'Eden TO']","['Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK. eve.roman@egu.york.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Fertil (Camb),"Human fertility (Cambridge, England)",100888143,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Hydatidiform Mole/complications/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pregnancy', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['Q64XW1271018K5QU [pii]', '10.1080/14647270600636400 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Fertil (Camb). 2006 Sep;9(3):171-4. doi: 10.1080/14647270600636400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results proved that binding of imatinib to the two main genetic variants is very different, the high affinity binding belongs dominantly to the F1-S variant. This interaction is accompanied with specific spectral changes (induced circular dichroism, UV change, intrinsic fluorescence quenching), suggesting that the bound ligand has chiral conformation that would largely overlap with other ligands inside the protein cavity. Binding parameters of Ka=1.7(+/-0.2)x10(6)M(-1) and n=0.94 could be determined for the binding on the F1-S variant at 37 degrees . Imatinib binding on the A variant is weaker and less specific.

Total 171 newly diagnosed APL patients entering CR were retrospectively analyzed from November 1989 to December 2004,with a median follow-up of 36 months (6-185 months). Univariate and multivariate analysis of eight factors potentially influencing survival and prognosis were carried out with Log-Rank and Cox regression method, including sex, age, initial WBC count, the level of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), first induction regimen, days from induction therapy to CR, post-remission therapy and the status of PML-RAR alpha fusion gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Blockade of Akt signaling by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (1-20 microM, 48 h) also resulted in the growth inhibition and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of HTLV-1-infected cells, with IC50 ranging from 5 to 20muM, and it caused de-phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP-1. Of note, when rapamycin was combined with LY294002, rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was blocked, and the ability of rapamycin to induce growth arrest of HTLV-1-infected T-cells and suppress the p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP-1 proteins was potentiated. Moreover, both LY294002 and rapamycin down-regulated the levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1 proteins in these cells, and their combination further decreased levels of these cell cycle-regulating proteins.

For all cell types tested mRNA was transfected more readily than DNA, and its expression was highly uniform in cell populations. Even cell types relatively resistant to transfection with DNA could express transfected mRNA well. The level of mRNA expression could be controlled over a wide range by changing the amount of input RNA. Cells could be efficiently and simultaneously loaded with several different transcripts. To test a potential clinical application of this method, we transfected human T lymphocytes with mRNA encoding a chimeric immune receptor directed against CD19, a surface antigen widely expressed in leukemia and lymphoma. The transfected mRNA conferred powerful cytotoxicity to T cells against CD19+ targets from the same donor.

The control group consisted of 29 healthy volunteers. In the blood plasma of studied persons concentration of TAT complexes and antithrombin (AT) activity were detected. RESULTS: We observed in patients, except MF, significant increase of TAT but diminished AT activity.

Such method facilitated to clearly see nucleolar bodies without perinucleolar chromatin, including those of micronucleoli. The bone marrow of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia (untreated with cytostatics) provided a satisfactory number of both myeloblasts and promyelocytes for nucleolar measurements because of prevailing granulopoiesis. The direct nucleolar measurement was carried out on digitized and processed images on the screen at magnification 4,300x. It seems to be likely that the nucleolar size is directly related to the number of nucleoli per cell. The largest nucleoli were present in both myeloblasts and promyelocytes that possessed a single nucleolus. In contrast, the nucleolar diameter was significantly smaller in cells with multiple nucleoli. However, in cells with small multiple nucleoli, one of them was always larger and dominant with a large number of AgNORs. Such large nucleoli are possibly visible in specimens stained with panoptic procedures or methods staining nuclear chromatin or DNA. It should also be mentioned that both myeloblasts and promyelocytes mostly possessed two nucleoli with the mean diameter close to 1.5 microm. The incidence of early granulocytic precursors classified according to the nucleolar number and size strongly suggested that the various nucleolar number and nucleolar size in these cells might be related to the different stage of the cell cycle and might also explain their heterogeneity.","['Smetana, K', 'Mikulenkova, D', 'Jiraskova, I', 'Klamova, H']","['Smetana K', 'Mikulenkova D', 'Jiraskova I', 'Klamova H']","['Clinical Department, Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleolus/*ultrastructure', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Karyometry', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/ultrastructure', 'RNA/analysis']",2006/09/30 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/09/30 09:00'],"['2006/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['FB2006A0004 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2006;52(1-2):16-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To obtain more information about the association between BCR-ABL mutations and type of imatinib resistance, we studied 30 early chronic phase (CP) CML patients, commencing imatinib therapy, using a conventional sequencing technique. Seven patients treated in late CP and three patients treated in the accelerated phase were included for comparison. Blood samples were collected before and every third month during imatinib therapy. Mutations were not seen in any blood sample collected before start of therapy. During imatinib treatment, 2 of the 30 early CP patients acquired point mutations and both of them had other signs of imatinib resistance. None of the five early CP patients with a complete hematologic response (HR), but no cytogenetic response at 12 months, displayed any missense mutation. Likewise, none of 12 early CP patients with detectable BCR-ABL transcripts but in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission at 12 months displayed any mutation. We conclude that screening early CP patients for BCR-ABL mutations before start of imatinib therapy is not cost-effective.

With morphological and cell flow-cytometric method, it was found that 1,25(OH)(2)D3 induced the differentiation of both leukemia cell lines toward monocytic lineage, but not affected the cell growth and apoptosis. The expressions of different subtypes of pp-GalNAc-T, the initial glycosyltransferase in O-glycan synthesis, were studied with RT-PCR before and after the treatment of different concentrations of 1,25(OH)(2)D3. Among fourteen subtypes of pp-GalNAc-T (T1 approximately T14), K562 cells obviously expressed pp-GalNAc-T2, T4, T5, T7 (T2 was the highest) and SHI-1 cells apparently expressed pp-GalNAcT1, T2, T3 and T4 (T4 was the highest) only. After K562 cells were treated 1, 25(OH)(2)D3 for 72 h, pp-GalNAc-T2, T4, T5, T7 were increased in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, pp-GalNAc-T1 and T2, especially T1, were up-regulated in SHI-1 cells by 1,25(OH)(2)D3, but T3 was unchanged and T4 was down-regulated. The different alterations of pp-GalNAc-Ts in these two cell lines were probably related to the different structural changes of O-glycans during 1,25(OH)(2)D3 induced differentiation.","['Qiu, Hao', 'Guo, Xiang-Hong', 'Mo, Jian-Hua', 'Jin, Mei-Fang', 'Wu, Shi-Liang', 'Chen, Hui-Li']","['Qiu H', 'Guo XH', 'Mo JH', 'Jin MF', 'Wu SL', 'Chen HL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Institute of Bioengineering, Suzhou University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.41 (polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/09/29 09:00,2007/04/12 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10719-006-8095-z [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2006 Nov;23(7-8):575-84. doi: 10.1007/s10719-006-8095-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Downregulation of AATF gene transcription within leukemic cells not only resulted in the downregulation of c-myc gene and vice-versa but also contributed to apoptosis leading to cell death. Further, the link between AATF expression and leukemic cellular apoptosis involved PI3K/Akt pathway. Based on these results we propose that AATF gene may be of crucial importance in maintaining the leukemic state of a cell compartment through its ability to initiate cell proliferation coupled with repression of cellular apoptosis.","['Kaul, Deepak', 'Mehrotra, Aanchal']","['Kaul D', 'Mehrotra A']","['Molecular Biology Unit,Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160012, India. dkaul_24@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (AATF protein, human)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Response Elements/drug effects', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Wortmannin']",2006/09/29 09:00,2007/06/19 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-006-9317-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2007 Mar;297(1-2):215-20. doi: 10.1007/s11010-006-9317-1.

DESIGN: A prospective comparative study. THP-1 cells, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, were used for the study. Migration assays were performed using transwell inserts. THP-1 cells were exposed to E2 or raloxifene in the presence of monocytic chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a major chemoattractant for monocytes. The cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and ERbeta for gene silencing. ER expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: MCP-1 induced the migration of the cells for 90 minutes. The addition of E2 or raloxifene significantly inhibited the MCP-1-induced migration for 90 minutes. Preincubation of THP-1 cells with an ER antagonist, ICI 182780, significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of E2 and raloxifene. Whereas transfection with siRNA of ERalpha significantly attenuated the inhibition by E2 of MCP-1-induced monocyte migration, transfection with control siRNA or siRNA of ERbeta had no effect on the rapid inhibitory action of E2. Moreover, preincubation of THP-1 cells with a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, had no effect on the rapid inhibitory action of E2. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that both E2 and raloxifene inhibited the MCP-1-induced monocyte migration through nongenomic ERalpha. This result may explain one of the antiatherosclerotic effects of E2 and raloxifene on vasculature.","['Yada-Hashimoto, Namiko', 'Nishio, Yukihiro', 'Ohmichi, Masahide', 'Hayakawa, Jun', 'Mabuchi, Seiji', 'Hisamoto, Koji', 'Nakatsuji, Yuki', 'Sasaki, Hiroshi', 'Seino-Noda, Hozumi', 'Sakata, Masahiro', 'Tasaka, Keiichi', 'Murata, Yuji']","['Yada-Hashimoto N', 'Nishio Y', 'Ohmichi M', 'Hayakawa J', 'Mabuchi S', 'Hisamoto K', 'Nakatsuji Y', 'Sasaki H', 'Seino-Noda H', 'Sakata M', 'Tasaka K', 'Murata Y']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Menopause,"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",9433353,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '22X328QOC4 (Fulvestrant)', '4F86W47BR6 (Raloxifene Hydrochloride)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Atherosclerosis/prevention & control', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/*pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/genetics', 'Fulvestrant', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Raloxifene Hydrochloride/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2006/09/29 09:00,2007/02/09 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.gme.0000248732.78698.a7 [doi]'],ppublish,Menopause. 2006 Nov-Dec;13(6):935-41. doi: 10.1097/01.gme.0000248732.78698.a7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cadaveric donor serum is often of poor quality and frequently yields falsely positive results in serological assays that may result in the graft being needlessly discarded. OBJECTIVE: We examined the influence of the time of blood collection after death, and the macroscopic aspect of serum, on serological test results in cadaveric cornea donors. METHODS: Five hundred sixty-five consecutive cadaveric cornea donors were systematically tested for serological markers of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HCV). We studied the influence of the macroscopic aspect of the donor's serum and the time of blood collection after death on the results of serological testing and on the subsequent decision to use or discard the graft. RESULTS: Twenty-one and a half percent of corneas were rejected on the basis of virological test results. We found significant relationships between the macroscopic aspect of serum at the time of testing and: (i) a positive, equivocal or discrepant result of immunoassays, for all markers except anti-HCV antibodies, (ii) non acceptance of cornea grafts, and (iii) the time of blood sampling after death. CONCLUSIONS: The macroscopic aspect of postmortem blood samples is the best predictor of the specificity of serological testing in cornea donors. Serological results should be interpreted with care when serum is macroscopically abnormal, and cadaveric donors should not be sampled more than 12 hr after death.","['Challine, Dominique', 'Roudot-Thoraval, Francoise', 'Sabatier, Patrick', 'Dubernet, Fabienne', 'Larderie, Patrick', 'Rigot, Pierrette', 'Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel']","['Challine D', 'Roudot-Thoraval F', 'Sabatier P', 'Dubernet F', 'Larderie P', 'Rigot P', 'Pawlotsky JM']","['Viral Emergency and Organ, Tissue, and Cell Donor Screening Laboratory, Department of Virology, INSERM U635, Hopital Henri Mondor, Universite Paris 12, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Cadaver', '*Cornea/abnormalities/pathology/virology', 'HIV/isolation & purification', 'HIV-1/isolation & purification', 'Hepacivirus/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B virus/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Living Donors', '*Tissue Donors']",2006/09/29 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000236572.27197.08 [doi]', '00007890-200609270-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2006 Sep 27;82(6):788-93. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000236572.27197.08.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Childhood cancer patients who are obese at diagnosis represent a particular challenge for the oncologist. Obesity may complicate chemotherapy dose determination, and has been associated with decreased overall and event-free survival in a number of adult cancer patients, and more recently in pediatric patients. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether obesity at diagnosis was associated with decreased overall and event-free survival in a cohort of 322 predominantly Hispanic pediatric patients with B-precursor ALL. Obesity was classified as an age-standardized and sex-standardized body mass index z-score at or above the 95th percentile. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and event-free survival were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Obesity at diagnosis was not associated with decreased overall survival (HR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval = 0.69-2.87) or event-free survival (HR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval = 0.65-1.82) in the overall cohort or in either of the 2 age-at-diagnosis (2 to 9 y; 10 to 18 y) subgroups. Our finding of no obesity-related prognostic effect in the overall cohort and in the under 2 to 9-year age-at-diagnosis cohort was consistent with the previous large-scale study of ALL patients; the absence of a prognostic effect in the 10 to 18-year age-at-diagnosis cohort, however, conflicted with previous findings.","['Baillargeon, Jacques', 'Langevin, Anne-Marie', 'Lewis, Margaret', 'Estrada, Jaime', 'Mullins, Judith', 'Pitney, Aaron', 'Ma, Jennie Z', 'Chisholm, Gary B', 'Pollock, Brad H']","['Baillargeon J', 'Langevin AM', 'Lewis M', 'Estrada J', 'Mullins J', 'Pitney A', 'Ma JZ', 'Chisholm GB', 'Pollock BH']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health Science Center, (UTHSCSA), Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229-3900, USA. baillargeon@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/09/29 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.mph.0000212985.33941.d8 [doi]', '00043426-200609000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2006 Sep;28(9):575-8. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000212985.33941.d8.,,,['CA11078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated the role of a newly identified SRF coactivator, MKL1, in the regulation of SRF-driven transcription in rat forebrain neurons. MKL1 expression was found in newborn rat cortical or hippocampal neurons in culture as well as in adult rat forebrain. Immunostaining demonstrated constitutive nuclear localization of MKL1 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, in the deep layers of the neocortex, and in cultured neurons. Overexpression of MKL1 in primary cortical neurons elevated SRF-driven transcription and enhanced its stimulation by BDNF. In addition, inhibition of endogenous MKL1 by overexpression of a dominant-negative MKL1 mutant or by small interfering RNA reduced BDNF activation of SRF-driven transcription. In neurons, endogenous MKL1 was associated with SRF-regulated chromatin regions of several endogenous genes including c-fos, JunB, Srf, and Cyr61. BDNF activation of MKL1/SRF-driven transcription was dependent on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, which also led to MKL1 phosphorylation. Finally, synaptic activity stimulation of SRF-driven transcription was reduced by inhibition of endogenous MKL1. Conversely, synaptic activity enhanced transcription by overexpressed MKL1. MKL1 regulation by synaptic activity was mediated through the NMDA receptor-activated ERK1/2. These results suggest that neuronal MKL1 contributes to SRF-regulated gene expression induced by BDNF or synaptic activity. In addition, MKL1 appears as a novel mediator of the signaling between ERK1/2 and SRF. Moreover, MKL1 is a likely regulator of SRF-driven transcription programs that underlie neuronal plasticity.","['Kalita, Katarzyna', 'Kharebava, Giorgi', 'Zheng, Jing-Juan', 'Hetman, Michal']","['Kalita K', 'Kharebava G', 'Zheng JJ', 'Hetman M']","['Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center and Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky 40292, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (CCN1 protein, rat)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cysteine-Rich Protein 61)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (U 0126)', '138381-45-0 (Y 27632)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '6384-92-5 (N-Methylaspartate)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', 'BH3B64OKL9 (4-Aminopyridine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'Y37615DVKC (Bicuculline)']",IM,"['4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bicuculline/pharmacology', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*physiology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cysteine-Rich Protein 61', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, fos', 'Hippocampus/cytology', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*physiology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'N-Methylaspartate/pharmacology', 'Neurons/chemistry/*physiology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Potassium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Prosencephalon/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyramidal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Serum Response Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Synaptic Transmission/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2006/09/29 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/39/10020 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2644-06.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2006 Sep 27;26(39):10020-32. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2644-06.2006.,,,"['P20 RR015576/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS047341/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS047341-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR015576-06/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6674463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progressively, these early cancer cells give rise to different generations of daughter cells that accumulate additional mutations, acting in concert to drive the full neoplastic phenotype. As we have currently deciphered many of the gene pathways disrupted in cancer, our knowledge about the nature of the normal cells susceptible to transformation upon mutation has remained more elusive. Adult stem cells are those that show long-term replicative potential, together with the capacities of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. These stem cell properties are tightly regulated in normal development, yet their alteration may be a critical issue for tumorigenesis. This concept has arisen from the striking degree of similarity noted between somatic stem cells and cancer cells, including the fundamental abilities to self-renew and differentiate. Given these shared attributes, it has been proposed that cancers are caused by transforming mutations occurring in tissue-specific stem cells. This hypothesis has been functionally supported by the observation that among all cancer cells within a particular tumor, only a minute cell fraction has the exclusive potential to regenerate the entire tumor cell population; these cells with stem-like properties have been termed cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells can originate from mutation in normal somatic stem cells that deregulate their physiological programs. Alternatively, mutations may target more committed progenitor cells or even mature cells, which become reprogrammed to acquire stem-like functions. In any case, mutated genes should promote expansion of stem/progenitor cells, thus increasing their predisposition to cancer development by expanding self-renewal and pluripotency over their normal tendency towards relative quiescency and proper differentiation.","['Martinez-Climent, Jose A', 'Andreu, Enrique J', 'Prosper, Felipe']","['Martinez-Climent JA', 'Andreu EJ', 'Prosper F']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. jamcliment@unav.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere']",2006/09/29 09:00,2006/11/01 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['972 [pii]', '10.1007/s12094-006-0035-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2006 Sep;8(9):647-63. doi: 10.1007/s12094-006-0035-7.,,,,,233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intensely bright X-rays from the latest synchrotrons will enable the use of extremely small crystals, and should usher in a period of rapid progress in resolving these previously refractory structures.","['Sorensen, Thomas L-M', 'McAuley, Katherine E', 'Flaig, Ralf', 'Duke, Elizabeth M H']","['Sorensen TL', 'McAuley KE', 'Flaig R', 'Duke EM']","['Macromolecular Crystallography Group, Diamond Light Source Limited, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0DE, UK.

Here, we studied the long-term outcomes and prognostic factors specific for adult T-ALL by combining patient data from the three prospective trials conducted by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG). Among 559 patients whose immunophenotypes could be evaluated, 87 (15.6%) were identified as T-ALL. Of them, 66 patients (75.8%) achieved complete remission, and relapse occurred in 41 patients. With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 7.5 years, the probability of overall survival was 35.0% at 5 years. Risk factor analysis revealed that serum albumin levels, initial white blood cell (WBC) counts, and age had independent values for predicting survival. For WBC, not only the high-count group (50 x 10(9)l(-1) or higher), but also the low-count group (less than 3 x 10(9)l(-1)) showed a significantly lower survival rates than the intermediate-count group (p=0.0055 and 0.0037, respectively).

We describe the improvement of a candidate therapeutic virus for virotherapy of leukemic cells. Virotherapy is based on the exclusive replication of a virus in leukemic cells, leading to the selective removal of these malignant cells. To improve the safety of such a virus, we constructed an HIV-1 variant that replicates exclusively in the presence of the nontoxic effector doxycycline (dox). This was achieved by replacement of the viral TAR-Tat system for transcriptional activation by the Escherichia coli-derived Tet system for inducible gene expression. This HIV-rtTA virus replicates in a strictly dox-dependent manner. In this virus, additional deletions and/or inactivating mutations were introduced in the genes for accessory proteins. These proteins are essential for virus replication in untransformed cells, but dispensable in leukemic T cells. These minimized HIV-rtTA variants contain up to 7 deletions/inactivating mutations (TAR, Tat, vif, vpR, vpU, nef and U3) and replicate efficiently in the leukemic SupT1 T cell line, but do not replicate in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These virus variants are also able to efficiently remove leukemic cells from a mixed culture with untransformed cells. The therapeutic viruses use CD4 and CXCR4 for cell entry and could potentially be used against CXCR4 expressing malignancies such as T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, NK leukemia and some myeloid leukemias.","['Jeeninga, Rienk E', 'Jan, Barbara', 'van den Berg, Henk', 'Berkhout, Ben']","['Jeeninga RE', 'Jan B', 'van den Berg H', 'Berkhout B']","['Laboratory of Experimental Virology, Department of Medical Microbiology Center for Infection and Immunity Amsterdam (CINIMA), Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. r.jeeninga@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxycycline/*pharmacology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, tat/metabolism', 'Genes, Viral', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2006/09/29 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/09/29 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-3-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-3-64 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2006 Sep 27;3:64. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-3-64.,20060927,,['R21-A147017-01/PHS HHS/United States'],PMC1592508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with newly diagnosed AML were asked to rate the level of available social support after diagnosis was made, but before the start of chemotherapy. Social support was assessed with the F-SozU, and information about confounding variables (age, functional status, intensity of chemotherapy, cytogenetic risk group) was collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to analyze predictors of 2-year survival. MAIN RESULTS: Higher levels of available social support predicted better survival, even after controlling for age, functional status, dosage of chemotherapy, and cytogenetic risk group. Within social support, the availability of instrumental support showed more consistent associations with 2-year survival than the availability of emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with AML, the availability of social support is relevant for decreased mortality, after accounting for age, functional impairment, dosage of chemotherapy and cytogenetic risk group.","['Pinquart, Martin', 'Hoffken, Klaus', 'Silbereisen, Rainer K', 'Wedding, Ulrich']","['Pinquart M', 'Hoffken K', 'Silbereisen RK', 'Wedding U']","['Department of Developmental Psychology and Center for Applied Developmental Science, Friedrich Schiller University, 07743, Jena, Germany.

Four risk groups were defined as very high risk (VHR; 5-year EFS, 45% or below), lower risk (5-year EFS, at least 85%), and standard and high risk (those remaining in the respective National Cancer Institute [NCI] risk groups). VHR criteria included extreme hypodiploidy (fewer than 44 chromosomes), t(9;22) and/or BCR/ABL, and induction failure. Lower-risk patients were NCI standard risk with either t(12;21) (TEL/AML1) or simultaneous trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17. Even with treatment differences, there was high concordance between the CCG and POG analyses. The COG risk classification scheme is being used for division of B-precursor ALL into lower- (27%), standard- (32%), high- (37%), and very-high- (4%) risk groups based on age, white blood cell (WBC) count, cytogenetics, day-14 marrow response, and end induction minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry in COG trials.","['Schultz, Kirk R', 'Pullen, D Jeanette', 'Sather, Harland N', 'Shuster, Jonathan J', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Camitta, Bruce M']","['Schultz KR', 'Pullen DJ', 'Sather HN', 'Shuster JJ', 'Devidas M', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Loh ML', 'Raetz EA', 'Winick NJ', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Gaynon PS', 'Camitta BM']","[""Children's Oncology Group, Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. kschultz@interchange.ubc.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Classification', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/28 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51974-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-01-024729 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 1;109(3):926-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-01-024729.

Therefore, factors that influence these signals have important pathophysiological roles in this disease. One key mediator of BCR signaling is protein kinase C beta (PKCbeta), which regulates the activation of I-kappaB kinases and the deactivation of Bruton tyrosine kinase within the signaling pathways initiated by BCR engagement. The present study demonstrates that overexpression of the PKCbetaII isoform is a feature of CLL cells and that activity of this enzyme strongly correlates with CLL cell response to BCR engagement. Thus, intracellular Ca2+ release and increases in cell survival after BCR cross-linking were significantly greater in CLL patients with low levels than in CLL patients with high levels of active PKCbetaII. Furthermore, BCR-induced Ca2+ fluxes could be restored in CLL patients with high levels of active PKCbetaII by pretreating the cells with the PKCbeta-specific inhibitor LY379196. Conversely, BCR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release could be inhibited in CLL cells with low levels of active PKCbetaII by pretreatment with the PKC agonist bryostatin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that overexpressed active PKCbetaII plays a role in the regulation and outcome of BCR signals that can be important for the progression of CLL.","['Abrams, Simon T', 'Lakum, Tasneem', 'Lin, Ke', 'Jones, Gemma M', 'Treweeke, Andrew T', 'Farahani, Mosavar', 'Hughes, Mair', 'Zuzel, Mirko', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Abrams ST', 'Lakum T', 'Lin K', 'Jones GM', 'Treweeke AT', 'Farahani M', 'Hughes M', 'Zuzel M', 'Slupsky JR']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (5,21 -', '12,17-dimetheneo-18H-dibenzo(i,o)pyrrolo(3,4-1)(1,8)diazacyclohexandecine-18,10(1', '9H)dione,8((dimethylamino)methyl)-6,7,8,9,10,11-hexahydro,monomethanesulfonate)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Mesylates)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Bryostatins', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Mesylates/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', '*Signal Transduction']",2006/09/28 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52007-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-03-012021 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 1;109(3):1193-201. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-012021.

The discovery of differential protein binding of flavopiridol in human and bovine serum contributed to an effective pharmacokinetic-derived schedule of administration of this agent. On the basis of pharmacokinetic modeling using our in vitro results and data from a previous trial, we initiated a phase 1 study using a 30-minute loading dose followed by 4 hours of infusion administered weekly for 4 of 6 weeks in patients with refractory CLL. A group of 42 patients were enrolled on 3 cohorts (cohort 1, 30 mg/m2 loading dose followed by 30 mg/m2 4-hour infusion; cohort 2, 40 mg/m2 loading dose followed by 40 mg/m2 4-hour infusion; and cohort 3, cohort 1 dose for treatments 1 to 4, then a 30 mg/m2 loading dose followed by a 50 mg/m2 4-hour infusion). The dose-limiting toxicity using this novel schedule was hyperacute tumor lysis syndrome. Aggressive prophylaxis and exclusion of patients with leukocyte counts greater than 200x10(9)/L have made this drug safe to administer at the cohort 3 dose. Of the 42 patients treated, 19 (45%) achieved a partial response with a median response duration that exceeds 12 months. Responses were noted in patients with genetically high-risk disease, including 5 (42%) of 12 patients with del(17p13.1) and 13 (72%) of 18 patients with del(11q22.3). Flavopiridol administered using this novel schedule has significant clinical activity in refractory CLL. Patients with bulky disease and high-risk genetic features have achieved durable responses, thereby justifying further study of flavopiridol in CLL and other diseases.","['Byrd, John C', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Dalton, James T', 'Wu, Di', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Fischer, Beth', 'Moran, Mollie', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Rovin, Brad', 'Brooker-McEldowney, Michelle', 'Broering, Sarah', 'Schaaf, Larry J', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lucas, David M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Young, Donn C', 'Suarez, Jose-Ramon', 'Colevas, A Dimitrios', 'Grever, Michael R']","['Byrd JC', 'Lin TS', 'Dalton JT', 'Wu D', 'Phelps MA', 'Fischer B', 'Moran M', 'Blum KA', 'Rovin B', 'Brooker-McEldowney M', 'Broering S', 'Schaaf LJ', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lucas DM', 'Heerema NA', 'Lozanski G', 'Young DC', 'Suarez JR', 'Colevas AD', 'Grever MR']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. john.byrd@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/28 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52040-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-020735 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 15;109(2):399-404. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-020735.

We have used in vitro suspension culture (SC) and nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune deficient (NOD/SCID) mouse assays to phenotypically characterize and purify T-ALL progenitor cells. Cells from 13 pediatric cases were maintained in vitro for at least 4 weeks and expanded in 8 cases. To characterize the progenitors, cells were sorted for expression of CD34 and CD4 or CD7 and the subfractions were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The majority of cells capable of long-term proliferation in vitro were derived from the CD34+/CD4- and CD34+/CD7- subfractions. Moreover, the CD34+/CD4- or CD7- cells were the only subfractions capable of NOD/SCID engraftment. These T-ALL cells successfully repopulated secondary and tertiary recipients with equivalent levels of engraftment, demonstrating self-renewal ability. The immunophenotype and genotype of the original leukemia cells were preserved with serial passage in the NOD/SCID mice. These data demonstrate the long-term repopulating ability of the CD34+/CD4- and CD34+/CD7- subfractions in T-ALL and suggest that a cell with a more primitive phenotype was the target for leukemic transformation in these cases.","['Cox, Charlotte V', 'Martin, Hannah M', 'Kearns, Pamela R', 'Virgo, Paul', 'Evely, Roger S', 'Blair, Allison']","['Cox CV', 'Martin HM', 'Kearns PR', 'Virgo P', 'Evely RS', 'Blair A']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, University of Bristol, BS10 5ND, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Stem Cells/*immunology/*pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/09/28 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52079-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-030445 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 15;109(2):674-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-030445.

Patients participated in randomized comparisons of (1) doxorubicin given with or without dexrazoxane, a cardioprotectant (high-risk patients), (2) intensive intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial radiation (standard-risk patients), and (3) Erwinia and Escherichia coli asparaginase (all patients). Between 1996 and 2000, 491 patients (aged 0-18 years) were enrolled (272 standard risk and 219 high risk). With a median of 5.7 years of follow-up, the estimated 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for all patients was 82%+/-2%. Dexrazoxane did not have a significant impact on the 5-year EFS of high-risk patients (P=.99), and there was no significant difference in outcome of standard-risk patients based on type of central nervous system (CNS) treatment (P=.26). Compared with E coli asparaginase, Erwinia asparaginase was associated with a lower incidence of toxicity (10% versus 24%), but also an inferior 5-year EFS (78%+/-4% versus 89%+/-3%, P=.01). We conclude that (1) dexrazoxane does not interfere with the antileukemic effect of doxorubicin, (2) intensive intrathecal chemotherapy is as effective as cranial radiation in preventing CNS relapse in standard-risk patients, and (3) once-weekly Erwinia is less toxic than E coli asparaginase, but also less efficacious.","['Moghrabi, Albert', 'Levy, Donna E', 'Asselin, Barbara', 'Barr, Ronald', 'Clavell, Luis', 'Hurwitz, Craig', 'Samson, Yvan', 'Schorin, Marshall', 'Dalton, Virginia K', 'Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Moghrabi A', 'Levy DE', 'Asselin B', 'Barr R', 'Clavell L', 'Hurwitz C', 'Samson Y', 'Schorin M', 'Dalton VK', 'Lipshultz SE', 'Neuberg DS', 'Gelber RD', 'Cohen HJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Sainte-Justine Hospital, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. albert.moghrabi@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Cardiotonic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Razoxane/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/28 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51970-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-027714 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Feb 1;109(3):896-904. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-027714.

Whereas the pathways underlying the molecular and biochemical details of nuclear breakdown that accompanies apoptosis have been elucidated, the precise nature of nuclear reorganization that precedes the demolition phase is not fully understood. Here, we expressed an inducible caspase-8 in human mesenchymal stem cells, and quantitatively followed the early changes in nuclear organization during apoptosis. We found that caspase-8 induces alteration of the nuclear lamina and a subsequent spatial reorganization of both centromeres, which are shifted towards a peripheral localization, and telomeres, which form aggregates. This nuclear reorganization correlates with caspase-3 sensitivity of lamina proteins, because the expression of lamin mutant constructs with caspase-3 hypersensitivity resulted in a caspase-8-independent appearance of lamina intranuclear structures and telomere aggregates, whereas application of a caspase inhibitor restrains these changes in nuclear reorganization. Notably, upon activation of apoptosis, we observed no initial changes in the spatial organization of the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). We suggest that during activation of the caspase-8 pathway changes in the lamina structure precede changes in heterochromatin spatial organization, and the subsequent breakdown of lamina and PML-NB.","['Raz, Vered', 'Carlotti, Francoise', 'Vermolen, Bart J', 'van der Poel, Egge', 'Sloos, Willem C R', 'Knaan-Shanzer, Shoshan', 'de Vries, Antoine A F', 'Hoeben, Rob C', 'Young, Ian T', 'Tanke, Hans J', 'Garini, Yuval', 'Dirks, Roeland W']","['Raz V', 'Carlotti F', 'Vermolen BJ', 'van der Poel E', 'Sloos WC', 'Knaan-Shanzer S', 'de Vries AA', 'Hoeben RC', 'Young IT', 'Tanke HJ', 'Garini Y', 'Dirks RW']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Einsteinweg 20, 2300RC Leiden, The Netherlands. v.raz@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centromere/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Heterochromatin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lamin Type B/genetics/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Lamina/*metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism']",2006/09/28 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.03180 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.03180 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2006 Oct 15;119(Pt 20):4247-56. doi: 10.1242/jcs.03180.

The structures of the LTR-containing oligonucleotides were compared to those of non-LTR oligonucleotides crystallized in the same lattice. Properties unique to the CA dinucleotide step within the LTR sequence, independent of its position from the end of the duplex, include a positive roll angle and negative slide value. This propensity for the CA dinucleotide step within the MMLV LTR sequence to adopt only positive roll angles is likely influenced by the more rigid, invariable 3' and 5' flanking TT dinucleotide steps and may be important for specific recognition and/or cleavage by the MMLV integrase.","['Montano, Sherwin P', 'Cote, Marie L', 'Roth, Monica J', 'Georgiadis, Millie M']","['Montano SP', 'Cote ML', 'Roth MJ', 'Georgiadis MM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Dr., Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Solvents)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Integrases/*metabolism', '*Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/*chemistry', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry', 'Solvents/chemistry', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences']",2006/09/28 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkl693 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkl693 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2006;34(19):5353-60. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkl693.

We demonstrate that 1) endogenous CIF production may be triggered by Ca2+ release (net loss) as well as by simple buffering of free Ca2+ within the stores, 2) a specific 82-kDa variant of iPLA2beta and its corresponding activity are present in membrane fraction of RBL cells, 3) exogenous CIF (extracted from other species) mimics the effects of endogenous CIF and activates iPLA2beta when applied to cell homogenates but not intact cells, 4) activation of ICRAC can be triggered in resting RBL cells by dialysis with exogenous CIF, 5) molecular or functional inhibition of iPLA2beta prevents activation of ICRAC, which could be rescued by cell dialysis with a human recombinant iPLA2beta, 6) dependence of ICRAC on intracellular pH strictly follows pH dependence of iPLA2beta activity, and 7) (S)-BEL, a chiral enantiomer of suicidal substrate specific for iPLA2beta, could be effectively used for pharmacological inhibition of ICRAC and store-operated Ca2+ entry.

In that respect, we used guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) to study its effects on K562 cell line. GTP, at concentrations between 25-200 microM, inhibited proliferation (3-90%) and induced 5-78% increase in benzidine-positive cells after 6-days of treatments of K562 cells. Flow cytometric analyses of glycophorine A (GPA) showed that GTP can induce expression of this marker in more mature erythroid cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects of GTP were also accompanied with inhibition of DNA synthesis (measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation) and early S-phase cell cycle arrest by 96 h of exposure. In contrast, no detectable effects were observed when GTP administered to unstimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). However, GTP induced an increase in proliferation, DNA synthesis and viability of mitogen-stimulated PBL cells. In addition, growth inhibition and differentiating effects of GTP were also induced by its corresponding nucleotides GDP, GMP and guanosine (Guo). In heat-inactivated medium, where rapid degradation of GTP via extracellular nucleotidases is slow, the anti-proliferative and differentiating effects of all type of guanine nucleotides (except Guo) were significantly decreased. Moreover, adenosine, as an inhibitor of Guo transporter system, markedly reduced the GTP effects in K562 cells, suggesting that the extracellular degradation of GTP or its final conversion to Guo may account for the mechanism of GTP effects. This view is further supported by the fact that GTP and Guo are both capable of impeding the effects of mycophenolic acid. In conclusion, our data will hopefully have important impact on pharmaceutical evaluation of guanine nucleotides for leukemia treatments.","['Moosavi, Mohammad Amin', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh', 'Lotfi, Abbas']","['Moosavi MA', 'Yazdanparast R', 'Lotfi A']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, P O Box. 13145-1384, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Biochem Mol Biol,Journal of biochemistry and molecular biology,9702084,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '85-32-5 (Guanosine Monophosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Guanosine/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'S Phase/*drug effects']",2006/09/28 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5483/bmbrep.2006.39.5.492 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Biol. 2006 Sep 30;39(5):492-501. doi: 10.5483/bmbrep.2006.39.5.492.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typical experimental perturbations included in spectra are baseline shift and scale variation between spectra. They have to be removed by data preprocessings to allow further data analysis and classification. In this work, we addressed baseline shift corrections and normalizations in attenuated total reflection (ATR) FT-IR spectra. We compared the efficiency of several preprocessing methods with series of spectra containing typical perturbations (baseline shift, scaling factor, and noise) and a priori known definite spectral difference. Several baseline-correction and normalization possibilities were evaluated. Our results were generally sensitive, selective, and robust with respect to baseline and scaling. Full-range scaling generated more false-positive results. Use of first- and second-derivative spectra was tested. Results obtained on model spectra were confirmed with series of spectra from sensitive and multidrug-resistant leukemia K562 cells. We showed that the use of derived spectra did not provide more efficiency and required additional preprocessing such as smoothing to obtain results similar to those obtained from non-derived ones. On the other hand, results obtained with derivatives were less sensitive to scaling, a useful feature when scaling is problematic.","['Gaigneaux, A', 'Ruysschaert, J M', 'Goormaghtigh, E']","['Gaigneaux A', 'Ruysschaert JM', 'Goormaghtigh E']","['Laboratory for the Structure and Function of Biological Membranes, Center for Structural Biology and Bioinformatics, CP 206/2, Free University of Brussels (ULB), Bld du triomphe, Acces 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Spectrosc,Applied spectroscopy,0372406,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/*methods', 'Spectrum Analysis']",2006/09/28 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1366/000370206778397416 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Spectrosc. 2006 Sep;60(9):1022-8. doi: 10.1366/000370206778397416.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the robustness as well as the format for such a diagnostic test remains to be determined. As a step towards clinical application of these findings, we have systematically analyzed a published ALL microarray data set using Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) and Random Forest (RF). METHODS: We examined published microarray data from 104 ALL patients specimens, that represent six different subgroups defined by cytogenetic features and immunophenotypes. Using the decision-tree based supervised learning algorithm Random Forest (RF), we determined a small set of genes for optimal subgroup distinction and subsequently validated their predictive power in an independent patient cohort. RESULTS: We achieved very high overall ALL subgroup prediction accuracies of about 98%, and were able to verify the robustness of these genes in an independent panel of 68 specimens obtained from a different institution and processed in a different laboratory. Our study established that the selection of discriminating genes is strongly dependent on the analysis method. This may have profound implications for clinical use, particularly when the classifier is reduced to a small set of genes. We have demonstrated that as few as 26 genes yield accurate class prediction and importantly, almost 70% of these genes have not been previously identified as essential for class distinction of the six ALL subgroups. CONCLUSION: Our finding supports the feasibility of qRT-PCR technology for standardized diagnostic testing in paediatric ALL and should, in conjunction with conventional cytogenetics lead to a more accurate classification of the disease. In addition, we have demonstrated that microarray findings from one study can be confirmed in an independent study, using an entirely independent patient cohort and with microarray experiments being performed by a different research team.","['Hoffmann, Katrin', 'Firth, Martin J', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Hoffmann K', 'Firth MJ', 'Beesley AH', 'de Klerk NH', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. katrinh@ichr.uwa.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Array Analysis/*methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2006/09/28 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2006/09/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-6-229 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-6-229 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2006 Sep 26;6:229. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-6-229.,20060926,,"['R21 CA095475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA095475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1609180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, radial glia become lineage restricted during development before they differentiate into more mature cell types in the CNS. We have previously shown that subpopulations of radial glial cells express markers for glial and neuronal restricted precursors (GRPs and NRPs) in expression patterns that are temporally and spatially regulated during CNS development. To characterize further the mechanism of this regulation in rat forebrain, we tested whether secreted factors that are present during development effect lineage restriction of radial glia. We show here that in radial glial cultures LIF/CNTF up-regulates, whereas BMP2 down-regulates GRP antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies A2B5/4D4. These activities combined with secretion of BMPs dorsally and LIF/CNTF from the choroid plexus provide an explanation for the graded distribution pattern of A2B5/4D4 in dorso-lateral ventricular regions in vivo. The regulation by LIF/CNTF of A2B5/4D4 is mediated through the JAK-STAT pathway. BMP2 promotes expression on radial glial cells of the NRP marker polysialic acid most likely by regulating N-CAM expression itself, as well as at least one polysialyl transferase responsible for synthesis of polysialic acid on N-CAM. Taken together, these results suggest that generation of lineage-restricted precursors is coordinately regulated by gradients of the secreted factors BMPs and LIF/CNTF during development of dorsal forebrain.","['Li, Hedong', 'Grumet, Martin']","['Li H', 'Grumet M']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, W.

It was the aim of this study to analyze the impact of trisomy 8 on the expression of genes located on chromosome 8 in distinct AML subgroups characterized by different chromosome abnormalities in addition to trisomy 8. Gene expression analyses were performed on a total of 567 AML cases comprising the following subgroups: +8 sole, +8 within a complex aberrant karyotype, +8 in addition to t(15;17), inv(16), t(8;21), 11q23/MLL, or other abnormalities, AML with normal karyotype and the before mentioned subgroups without trisomy 8. A significant higher mean expression of genes located on chromosome 8 was observed in subgroups with +8 in comparison to their respective control groups. A varying number of significantly higher expressed genes was identified in all comparisons. No gene was significantly overexpressed in all comparisons, and no distinct gene expression pattern was identified allowing the identification of cases with trisomy 8. In conclusion, the gain of chromosome 8 leads to a higher expression of genes located on chromosome 8. However, no consistent pattern of genes was identified, which shows a higher expression in all AML subtypes with trisomy 8. These data suggest that trisomy 8 rather provides a platform for a higher expression of chromosome 8 genes which are individually up-regulated by the respective primary genetic abnormalities. Therefore, trisomy 8 in AML determines no specific disease characteristic but is a disease modulating secondary event.","['Schoch, Claudia', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Schoch C', 'Kohlmann A', 'Dugas M', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T']","['Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), Munich 81377, Germany. claudia.schoch@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Trisomy', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/09/27 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20380 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Dec;45(12):1164-8. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20380.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentially expressed proteins, a number of which are related to the cell cycle function, including oncoprotein18 (OP18), heat shock protein70, glucose-regulated protein75, and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, were identified by MS. Subsequent bioinformatic pathway discovery revealed an integrated network constituting SMARCB1, MYC, and TP53-regulated pathways. The data from the DNA microarray and proteomic experiments demonstrated the correlation between the translocation and higher expression of OP18 at mRNA and protein levels. Transient cotransfection assay revealed that PML-RARalpha is a potent activator of OP18 promoter and this transcriptional activation is retinoic acid sensitive. PML-RARalpha induction also leads to decreased phosphorylation on Ser63 residue of OP18, which is okadaic acid sensitive suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase pathway. Overexpression of a constitutively phosphorylated Ser63 mutant of OP18 in PML-RARalpha expressing APL patient, PR9, and NB4 cells led to a G2/M-phase arrest in contrast to a phosphorylation-deficient Ser63 mutant and untransfected control. Taken together, our results demonstrate the significance of decreased Ser63 phosphorylation of OP18 in PML-RARalpha-mediated effects on cell cycle.","['Zada, Abdul A Peer', 'Geletu, Mulu H', 'Pulikkan, John A', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Reddy, Venkateshwar A', 'Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang D', 'Behre, Hermann M', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Behre, Gerhard']","['Zada AA', 'Geletu MH', 'Pulikkan JA', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Reddy VA', 'Christopeit M', 'Hiddemann WD', 'Behre HM', 'Tenen DG', 'Behre G']","['BMT Unit, Internal Medicine IV, MLU University, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Stathmin/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Zinc Sulfate']",2006/09/27 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200600307 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2006 Nov;6(21):5705-19. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200600307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Truncated G-CSF receptors (G-CSF-Rs) that fail to internalize show sustained proliferation and defective differentiation signaling. Steady-state forward routing also determines cell surface levels of cytokine receptors, but mechanisms controlling this are poorly understood. Here, we show that WD40 and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) box protein-2 (Wsb-2), an SOCS box-containing WD40 protein with currently unknown function, binds to the COOH-terminal region of G-CSF-R. Removal of this region did not affect internalization, yet resulted in increased membrane expression of G-CSF-R and enhanced proliferation signaling at the expense of differentiation induction. Conversely, Wsb-2 binding to the G-CSF-R reduced its cell surface expression and inhibited proliferation signaling. These effects depended on the SOCS box involved in ubiquitylation and on cytosolic lysines of G-CSF-R and imply a major role for ubiquitylation through the G-CSF-R C-terminus in forward routing of the receptor. Importantly, the Wsb-2 gene is commonly disrupted by virus integrations in mouse leukemia. We conclude that control of forward routing of G-CSF-R is essential for a balanced response of myeloid progenitors to G-CSF and suggest that disturbance of this balance may contribute to myeloid leukemia.","['Erkeland, S J', 'Aarts, L H', 'Irandoust, M', 'Roovers, O', 'Klomp, A', 'Valkhof, M', 'Gits, J', 'Eyckerman, S', 'Tavernier, J', 'Touw, I P']","['Erkeland SJ', 'Aarts LH', 'Irandoust M', 'Roovers O', 'Klomp A', 'Valkhof M', 'Gits J', 'Eyckerman S', 'Tavernier J', 'Touw IP']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (Wsb-2 protein, mouse)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2006/09/27 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210004 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210004 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Mar 29;26(14):1985-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210004.

Etoposide, 100 mg/m body surface area/24 h, was administered by 96-h continuous intravenous infusion. Concomitantly, the children received cytarabine 200 mg/m/24 h by intravenous infusion and 6-thioguanine 100 mg/m twice daily orally. Median total body clearance in children 0.5-1.8 (n=4) and 2.3-17.7 years old (n=36) without Down's syndrome was 17.1 and 17.6 ml/min/m, respectively (P=0.96). Five children with Down's syndrome had a median clearance of 13.6 ml/min/m (P=0.067 compared with non-Down's syndrome children). Eighteen of the children received a second identical treatment course 3-4 weeks later; there was a significant correlation between individual clearance values (rho=0.56; P=0.017). We found no significant correlation between etoposide pharmacokinetics and the remission rate or the relapse rate. In conclusion, our findings indicate that special dose-calculation guidelines for infants above 3 months old are not substantiated by age-dependent pharmacokinetics of etoposide. Down's syndrome children might be candidates for dose reduction if our data are confirmed in larger numbers of patients. Low course-to-course variability indicates that pharmacokinetically guided dosing of etoposide might be clinically relevant, if larger studies can demonstrate that this approach decreases toxicity or increases response rates.","['Palle, Josefine', 'Frost, Britt-Marie', 'Gustafsson, Goran', 'Hellebostad, Marit', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Liliemark, Eva', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar']","['Palle J', 'Frost BM', 'Gustafsson G', 'Hellebostad M', 'Kanerva J', 'Liliemark E', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Lonnerholm G']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. josefine.palle@akademiska.se""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2006/09/27 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cad.0000231470.54288.49 [doi]', '00001813-200610000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2006 Oct;17(9):1087-94. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000231470.54288.49.,,,,,,"['Anticancer Drugs. 2010 Jan;21(1):129.

It is unknown whether any other mutations are needed for the chronic phase of the disease. The CML incidence increases as a function of age with an exponent of approximately 3. A slope of 3 could indicate that there are two mutations, in addition to the Philadelphia translocation, that have not yet been discovered. In this work, we explore an alternative hypothesis: We study a model of cancer initiation requiring only a single mutation. A mutated cell has a net reproductive advantage over normal cells and, therefore, might give rise to clonal expansion. The cancer is detected with a probability that is proportional to the size of the mutated cell clone. This model has three waiting times: (i) the time until a mutated cell is produced, (ii) the time of clonal expansion, and (iii) the time until the clone is detected. Surprisingly, this simple process can give rise to cancer incidence curves with exponents up to 3. Therefore, the CML incidence data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Philadelphia translocation alone is sufficient to cause chronic phase CML.","['Michor, Franziska', 'Iwasa, Yoh', 'Nowak, Martin A']","['Michor F', 'Iwasa Y', 'Nowak MA']","['Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, Department of Mathematics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA. franziska.michor@harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Genetic', 'Mutation/*genetics']",2006/09/27 09:00,2006/11/07 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['0607006103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0607006103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 3;103(40):14931-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0607006103.

We did not observe a comparable redistribution of EGFP-SUMO1. We have investigated the specificity of SUSP1 using vinyl sulfone inhibitors and model substrates.

In contrast with the antileukemic effect of cytarabin, this was more pronounced when cell lines or freshly obtained childhood BCP-ALL cells were cocultured with stromal cells. CC-4047 induced the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in stroma-cocultured BCP-ALL cells. The inhibition of tumor growth, caspase-3 cleavage, and reduced microvessel density was observed in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice inoculated s.c. with childhood BCP-ALL cells upon CC-4047 treatment. After i.v. BCP-ALL xenotransplantation, CC-4047 reduced splenic dissemination. CONCLUSIONS: The thalidomide analogue, CC-4047, displays profound cytostatic effects on stroma-supported human ALL cells both in vitro and in vivo.","['Shalapour, Shabnam', 'Zelmer, Andrea', 'Pfau, Madlen', 'Moderegger, Eva', 'Costa-Blechschmidt, Cristiane', 'van Landeghem, Frank K H', 'Taube, Tillmann', 'Fichtner, Iduna', 'Buhrer, Christoph', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Seeger, Karl', 'Wellmann, Sven']","['Shalapour S', 'Zelmer A', 'Pfau M', 'Moderegger E', 'Costa-Blechschmidt C', 'van Landeghem FK', 'Taube T', 'Fichtner I', 'Buhrer C', 'Henze G', 'Seeger K', 'Wellmann S']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Institute of Neuropathology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Germany, and University Children's Hospital (UKBB), Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blood Vessels/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/09/27 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/18/5526 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0719 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Sep 15;12(18):5526-32. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0719.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In murine transplantation models, administration of naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) can prevent GvHD. Toward understanding the role of human Treg in stem cell transplantation, we studied their capacity to modulate T-cell-dependent xenogeneic (x)-GvHD in a new model where x-GvHD is induced in RAG2-/-gammac-/- mice by i.v. administration of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human PBMC, depleted of or supplemented with autologous CD25+ Tregs, were administered in mice at different doses. The development of x-GvHD, in vivo expansion of human T cells, and secretion of human cytokines were monitored at weekly intervals. RESULTS: Depletion of CD25+ cells from human PBMC significantly exacerbated x-GvHD and accelerated its lethality. In contrast, coadministration of Treg-enriched CD25+ cell fractions with autologous PBMC significantly reduced the lethality of x-GvHD. Treg administration significantly inhibited the explosive expansion of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, protection from x-GvHD after Treg administration was associated with a significant increase in plasma levels of interleukin-10 and IFN-gamma, suggesting the de novo development of TR1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results show, for the first time, the potent in vivo capacity of naturally occurring human Tregs to control GvHD-inducing autologous T cells, and indicate that this xenogeneic in vivo model may provide a suitable platform to further explore the in vivo mechanisms of T-cell down-regulation by naturally occurring human Tregs.","['Mutis, Tuna', 'van Rijn, Rozemarijn S', 'Simonetti, Elles R', 'Aarts-Riemens, Tineke', 'Emmelot, Maarten E', 'van Bloois, Louis', 'Martens, Anton', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Ebeling, Saskia B']","['Mutis T', 'van Rijn RS', 'Simonetti ER', 'Aarts-Riemens T', 'Emmelot ME', 'van Bloois L', 'Martens A', 'Verdonck LF', 'Ebeling SB']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht and Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Netherlands. t.mutis@azu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Heterophile)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Heterophile/*immunology', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Blood Transfusion, Autologous/veterinary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/*genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-10/blood', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*physiology']",2006/09/27 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/18/5520 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0035 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Sep 15;12(18):5520-5. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0035.,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Sep 15;12(18):5265-7.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two phase 2 trials, one conducted in pediatric patients and the other in adult patients, were reviewed. The i.v. dose and schedule of nelarabine in the pediatric and adult studies was 650 mg/m2/d daily for 5 days and 1,500 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Treatments were repeated every 21 days. Study end points were the rates of complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic or bone marrow recovery (CR*). RESULTS: The pediatric efficacy population consisted of 39 patients who had relapsed or had been refractory to two or more induction regimens. CR to nelarabine treatment was observed in 5 (13%) patients and CR+CR* was observed in 9 (23%) patients. The adult efficacy population consisted of 28 patients. CR to nelarabine treatment was observed in 5 (18%) patients and CR+CR* was observed in 6 (21%) patients. Neurologic toxicity was dose limiting for both pediatric and adult patients. Other severe toxicities included laboratory abnormalities in pediatric patients and gastrointestinal and pulmonary toxicities in adults. CONCLUSIONS: On October 28, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for nelarabine for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma after at least two prior regimens.

Interleukin 11 (IL-11) and leukaemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) are factors associated with implantation window in human eutopic endometrium. We decided to test whether there is an altered secretion of these factors, which could explain receptivity defect in patients with minimal endometriosis. METHODS: Uterine flushing and endometrial samples were collected 7-9 days after ovulation (implantation window) from infertile patients with stage I/II endometriosis (n = 14) and fertile, endometriosis-free controls (n = 21). IL-11 and LIF were assessed in uterine flushings in eutopic endometria in all patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In eutopic endometrium, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed for LIF and IL-11 mRNA expressions. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in uterine flushing in women with and without endometriosis with regard to IL-11 levels (0.0 pg/ml versus 0.0 pg/ml) and LIF (25.53 pg/ml versus 36.26 pg/ml). These results were confirmed by the results of RT-PCR, where there were also no differences between studied groups.

Exposure early in life, and particularly during periods of rapid development, such as during foetal life and infancy, may have severe effects on child health and development by elevating the risk of congenital malformations, cancer, malabsorption, immunological dysfunction, endocrine disease, and neurobehavioural deficiencies. As pesticides can also interfere with parental reproductive health, exposure of parents may have consequences for the offspring leading to reduced chance of male birth and increased risk of childhood cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Current knowledge about tolerable levels and consequences of toxic exposure to pesticides during human development is rather scarce. Owing to the high risk of exposure to pesticides, particularly in less developed countries, further elucidation by well-controlled epidemiological studies in this field it is urgently needed. The Policy Interpretation Network on Children's Health and Environment (PINCHE), which is financed by the EU DG research has suggested actions against pesticide exposure.

METHOD: Six patients (five male and one female; age range 8-14 years), diagnosed with HBV-HCV infections during follow-up at the oncology outpatient clinic during 2000-2001 were included in the study. They had received an average of 25.8 units of blood by transfusion per patient during their treatment for malignancies. Positive serological HBV indicators were determined 20-40 months after the end of chemotherapy. HCV RNA positivity was determined together with HBV at an average of 3.3 months after hepatitis B infection. Patients received interferon-alpha-2b and ribavirin for 12 months. RESULTS: Both HBV DNA and HCV RNA became negative, and anti-HBe became positive in one patient. One patient had decreased HBV DNA levels and negative HCV RNA and HBeAg, but HBeAg became positive again at 18-months following treatment. Another patient had decreased serum HBV DNA and HCV RNA levels with normal ALT levels at the end of treatment; however, two months after therapy was ceased these values returned to pretreatment levels.

Leukemogenic translocations originating during fetal life are insufficient for overt leukemia. Transgenic TEL-AML1 mice have failed to develop leukemia. Additional postnatal events are required for full leukemogenesis. The significant peak-age (2-5 years) first appeared after 1940 in Great Britain. Since then, childhood leukemia has almost unchangeable incidence. In 1940 the introduction of immunization against diphtheria on a national scale was begun in Great Britain. HYPOTHESIS: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is triggered by vaccination against diphtheria. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Epidemiological survey for leukemia cases among ""exemptors"" and unvaccinated cases among ALL children should be done. Simultaneously, the transgenic TEL-AML1 mice should be vaccinated with the diphtheritic toxoid.

In the present study, high-resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) were used to characterise the 9p and 20q breakpoints (BPs) in seven childhood BCP ALLs with dic(9;20), which was shown to be unbalanced in all of them, resulting in loss of 9p13.2-pter. Five of the cases had loss of 20q11.2-qter, whereas two displayed gain of 20cen-pter. All BPs on 9p clustered in a 1.5 Mb segment of the sub-band 9p13.2; in three of the cases, the 20q BPs mapped to three adjacent clones covering a distance of 350 kb at 20q11.2. Thus, the aberration should be designated dic(9;20)(p13.2;q11.2). One of the ALLs, shown to have a complex dic(9;20), was further investigated by FISH, revealing a rearrangement of the haemapoietic cell kinase isoform p61 (HCK) gene at 20q11. The disruption of HCK may result in a fusion gene or in loss of function. Unfortunately, lack of material precluded further analyses of HCK. Thus, it remains to be elucidated whether dic(9;20)(p13.2;q11.2) leads to a chimaeric gene or whether the functionally important outcome is loss of 9p and 20q material.","['Schoumans, Jacqueline', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Corcoran, Martin', 'Kuchinskaya, Ekaterina', 'Golovleva, Irina', 'Grander, Dan', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Staaf, Johan', 'Borg, Ake', 'Gustafsson, Britt', 'Blennow, Elisabeth', 'Nordgren, Ann']","['Schoumans J', 'Johansson B', 'Corcoran M', 'Kuchinskaya E', 'Golovleva I', 'Grander D', 'Forestier E', 'Staaf J', 'Borg A', 'Gustafsson B', 'Blennow E', 'Nordgren A']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. jacqueline.schoumans@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods']",2006/09/27 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6328 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06328.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Nov;135(4):492-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06328.x.

To gain further insights into the roles of circadian genes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we analyzed peripheral blood from 53 healthy individuals and 35 CML patients for the expression of the nine circadian genes. The expression levels of hPER1, hPER2, hPER3, hCRY1, hCRY2 and hBMAL1 were significantly impaired in both chronic phase and blastic crisis of CML cases compared with those in healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Methylation studies in the promoter areas of these six genes revealed that only the CpG sites of the hPER3 gene were methylated in all of the CML patients, and the methylated CpG frequencies differed significantly in patients at blastic crisis (8.24 +/- 0.73) or at chronic phase (4.48 +/- 0.48). The CpG sites of the hPER2 gene were also methylated in 40% of the CML patients. No mutation was found within the coding region of hPER3 in CML cases.

The serum level of IL-6 temporarily increased after transplantation, and this increase seemed to be correlated with the expansion of CD19+ B cells. Although, compared with BMT, little is known about the kinetics of hematological and immunological reconstitution in U-CBT, there was initial B-cell recovery after CBT as some described. This B cell recovery may be associated with a high number of B-cell precursors present in cord blood (CB).

Dedifferentiated and well-differentiated liposarcomas are the two pathological subtypes of liposarcoma, based on the WHO classification. Transition from well-differentiated to dedifferentiated liposarcoma is a well-recognized phenomenon. Well-differentiated tumors are known to have low malignancy grade. However, when dedifferentiation occurs, the tumor acquires the aggressive features of a fully malignant lesion. This process largely is believed to progress in a time-dependant manner; however, time is not the only factor of importance. The potential roles of other factors in this transition are still unclear. To date, the coexistence of AML and liposarcoma has not been reported in the literature.

Detection of abnormal clones by PCR analysis of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in immunoglobulin genes is currently standard practice for diagnosis, but is not widely used to monitor MRD because of the low sensitivity of assays that use consensus primers. Use of specific primers can improve the sensitivity of the assay, but is a cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming process. We developed a simple and cost-effective approach to detect MRD in B-cell malignancies that is usable in clinical laboratories. The new assay uses ligase chain reaction (LCR) to detect clonality.

DATA SOURCES: Medline, MedlinePlus, EBSCO, PubMed, MD Consult, CINAHL, Clinical Pharmacology, ERIC, Biomedical Reference Collection-Basic, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source-Nursing/Academic Edition, Ovid, CANCERLIT, and the Cochrane Library Online. CONCLUSIONS: Because measles infection has a low incidence rate in the United States, it may be advisable not to vaccinate children who are immunocompromised and risk side effects of the vaccine. In contrast to measles infection, varicella has a higher incidence rate and poses a more imminent threat to those who are immunocompromised. Children who are immunosuppressed can receive the varicella vaccination; however, they should have regular titers drawn to confirm adequate protection against the disease and should receive boosters as deemed appropriate. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The number of solid organ transplant recipients is steadily increasing with more than 600,000 solid organ transplantations worldwide since the first renal transplant in 1954. The steadily increasing numbers of pediatric patients surviving transplantation, coupled with increased life expectancy, accelerate the need for nurse practitioners to understand the management of these delicate patients following release from the transplant unit.","['Luthy, Karlen E', 'Tiedeman, Mary E', 'Beckstrand, Renea L', 'Mills, Debra Ann']","['Luthy KE', 'Tiedeman ME', 'Beckstrand RL', 'Mills DA']","['College of Nursing, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602-5432, USA. beth-luthy@byu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Am Acad Nurse Pract,Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners,8916634,"['0 (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)']",,"['Child', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/*adverse effects/immunology']",2006/09/27 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['JAAN163 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1745-7599.2006.00163.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Nurse Pract. 2006 Oct;18(10):494-503. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2006.00163.x.,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of RIT with alpha-emitters is attractive, owing to the high (LET) nature and short path length of alpha particles allowing for higher tumor cell kill and lower toxicity to healthy tissues. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the response of B-Cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells in vitro after treatment with chemotherapy (cisplatin, fludarabine, doxorubicin, or vincristine) or other pharmaceuticals (colchicine, simvastatin, or cyclosporin A) in combination with (60)Co-gamma or (213)Bi-alpha-irradiation. METHODS: (213)Bi was eluted from a (225)Ac generator. Apoptosis was scored by flow cytometric analysis of the cells stained with Annexin-V and 7 amino actinomycin D. Metabolic activity was assessed by a MTT assay. RESULTS: The response induced by alpha- irradiation is systematically higher than the response induced by gamma-irradiation. The combination of drug treatment with alpha-irradiation induced a systematic, higher response, compared to treatment with drugs alone, even for the highest concentrations used. For all the drugs used in this study, synergism or additivity was demonstrated for the combination of drugs and radiotherapy with a stronger effect for alpha-particles. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this in vitro study highlight a potential benefit of alpha-irradiation in combination with the drugs considered in this study.","['Vandenbulcke, Katia', 'Thierens, Hubert', 'De Vos, Filip', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Janssens, Ann', 'Apostolidis, Christos', 'Morgenstern, Alfred', 'Bacher, Klaus', 'de Gelder, Virginie', 'Dierckx, Rudi A', 'Slegers, Guido']","['Vandenbulcke K', 'Thierens H', 'De Vos F', 'Philippe J', 'Offner F', 'Janssens A', 'Apostolidis C', 'Morgenstern A', 'Bacher K', 'de Gelder V', 'Dierckx RA', 'Slegers G']","['Department of Radiopharmacy, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bismuth/chemistry', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gamma Rays/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Linear Energy Transfer', 'Radioisotopes']",2006/09/27 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2006.21.364 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2006 Aug;21(4):364-72. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2006.21.364.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rat neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) isolated from this region retain their multipotency in vitro and in vivo after grafting into the adult brain. Recent studies have shown that endogenous or grafted NSPCs are activated after an injury and migrate toward lesioned areas. In these areas, reactive astrocytes are present and secrete numerous molecules and growth factors; however, it is not currently known whether reactive astrocytes can influence the lineage selection of NSPCs. We investigated whether reactive astrocytes could affect the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of adult NSPCs by modelling astrogliosis in vitro, using mechanical lesion of primary astrocytes. Initially, it was found that conditioned medium from lesioned astrocytes induced astrocytic differentiation of NSPCs without affecting neuronal or oligodendrocytic differentiation. In addition, NSPCs in coculture with lesioned astrocytes also displayed increased astrocytic differentiation and some of these NSPC-derived astrocytes participated in glial scar formation in vitro. When proliferation and survival of NSPCs were analyzed, no differential effects were observed between lesioned and nonlesioned astrocytes. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the astrocyte-inducing activity, the expression of two potent inducers of astroglial differentiation, ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, was analyzed by Western blot and shown to be up-regulated in conditioned medium from lesioned astrocytes. These results demonstrate that lesioned astrocytes can induce astroglial differentiation of NSPCs and provide a mechanism for astroglial differentiation of these cells following brain injury.","['Faijerson, J', 'Tinsley, R B', 'Aprico, K', 'Thorsell, A', 'Nodin, C', 'Nilsson, M', 'Blomstrand, F', 'Eriksson, P S']","['Faijerson J', 'Tinsley RB', 'Aprico K', 'Thorsell A', 'Nodin C', 'Nilsson M', 'Blomstrand F', 'Eriksson PS']","['Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology at Sahlgrenska Academy, Goteborg University, Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, rat)', '0 (Nestin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Brain Injuries/physiopathology/surgery', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Dentate Gyrus/cytology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tritium/metabolism']",2006/09/26 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.21044 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2006 Nov 15;84(7):1415-24. doi: 10.1002/jnr.21044.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For optimum functional activity they acquire an optimized structure for antigen (Ag) recognition, precipitation, agglutination, phagocytosis (IgG1/3 and IgA), cytotoxicity (IgG1/3), transport through mucosa (IgA and IgM) and placenta (IgG1/3), complement activation (IgG1/3 and IgM) and release of inflammatory mediators (IgE). A diversity with potentially up to 10(15) different Ab specificities is generated during Ag-independent B cell development in the bone marrow by combinatorial V-D-J joining, creation of junctional diversity, and combinatorial association of L and H chains. Furthermore,Ab variety is created during Ag-dependent B cell maturation in peripheral lymphatic tissues by isotype class switching and somatic hypermutation. Two types of enzymes play a key role in Ab diverseness, i. e., the products of recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 and the affinity induced deaminase (AID). The prevailing adult-type B2 cells provide the basis for the acquired humoral immune response characterized by Ab production,Ag processing and presentation, immunological memory and tolerance along with the generation of the anti-idiotype network,whereas the fetal-type B1 cells may play a role in innate immunity and autoimmunity. Impairment of B cell immunity includes immunodeficiency (agammaglobulinemia), malignant transformation (leukemia, lymphoma, plasmocytoma) and immune dysregulation (allergy, autoimmunity). The diagnostic relevance of Abs comprises classical serology (immunoprecipitation, agglutination, complement binding, RIA, ELISA), immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence (microscopic and flow cytometric), cytotoxicity tests, immunoblots, immunospot assays and immunoabsorption (affinity chromatography). Therapeutic application of Abs (passive immunization) is directed against infections, intoxications, solid tumors, leukemias and lymphomas, graft rejection and graft-versus-host reaction, hemolytic anemia, and autoimmune diseases. The generation of genetically engineered monoclonal Abs (mAbs) has revolutionized the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of Abs in almost all disciplines of modern medicine.","['Mix, Eilhard', 'Goertsches, Robert', 'Zett, Uwe K']","['Mix E', 'Goertsches R', 'Zett UK']","['University of Rostock, Dept. of Neurology, Gehlsheimer Str. 20, 18147, Rostock, Germany. eilhard.mix@med.uni-rostock.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,J Neurol,Journal of neurology,0423161,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/classification/*immunology/*therapeutic use']",2006/09/26 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00415-006-5002-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurol. 2006 Sep;253 Suppl 5:V9-17. doi: 10.1007/s00415-006-5002-2.,,,,,15,['J Neurol. 2008 Feb;255(2):308'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-alpha protected umbilical cord blood CD19-positive B lymphocytes from apoptotic cell death in vitro. IFN-alpha significantly decreased colony formation of all three cell lines, and in contrast to normal cells, induced apoptosis in JY and BL-41 and excessive necrosis in HHV-8 infected BCBL-1 cells.

The identification of 11 different FA genes has revealed a complex web of interacting proteins that are involved in the recognition or repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and perhaps other forms of DNA damage. Bi-allelic mutations in BRCA2 are associated with a rare and highly cancer-prone form of FA, and the DNA helicase BRIP1 (formerly BACH1) is mutated in FA group J. There is little convincing evidence that FA heterozygotes are at increased risk of cancer, but larger studies are needed to address the possibility of modest risk effects.

In vivo administration of this antibody to nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune-deficient mice transplanted with human AML markedly reduced leukemic repopulation. Absence of leukemia in serially transplanted mice demonstrated that AML LSCs are directly targeted. Mechanisms underlying this eradication included interference with transport to stem cell-supportive microenvironmental niches and alteration of AML-LSC fate, identifying CD44 as a key regulator of AML LSCs. The finding that AML LSCs require interaction with a niche to maintain their stem cell properties provides a therapeutic strategy to eliminate quiescent AML LSCs and may be applicable to other types of cancer stem cells.","['Jin, Liqing', 'Hope, Kristin J', 'Zhai, Qiongli', 'Smadja-Joffe, Florence', 'Dick, John E']","['Jin L', 'Hope KJ', 'Zhai Q', 'Smadja-Joffe F', 'Dick JE']","['Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, University Health Network Suite 8-355, Toronto Medical Discovery Tower, 101 College Street, Toronto, M5G 1L7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2006/09/26 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1483 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1483 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2006 Oct;12(10):1167-74. doi: 10.1038/nm1483.

Here we show that CD44 expression is increased on mouse stem-progenitor cells expressing BCR-ABL and that CD44 contributes functional E-selectin ligands. In a mouse retroviral transplantation model of CML, BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors from CD44-mutant donors are defective in homing to recipient marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and impaired induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease. By contrast, CD44-deficient stem cells transduced with empty retrovirus engraft as efficiently as do wild-type HSCs. CD44 is dispensable for induction of acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia by BCR-ABL, indicating that CD44 is specifically required on leukemic cells that initiate CML. The requirement for donor CD44 is bypassed by direct intrafemoral injection of BCR-ABL1-transduced CD44-deficient stem cells or by coexpression of human CD44. Antibody to CD44 attenuates induction of CML-like leukemia in recipients. These results show that BCR-ABL-expressing leukemic stem cells depend to a greater extent on CD44 for homing and engraftment than do normal HSCs, and argue that CD44 blockade may be beneficial in autologous transplantation in CML.","['Krause, Daniela S', 'Lazarides, Katherine', 'von Andrian, Ulrich H', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Krause DS', 'Lazarides K', 'von Andrian UH', 'Van Etten RA']","['Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts-New England Medical Center, 750 Washington Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2006/09/26 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1489 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1489 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2006 Oct;12(10):1175-80. doi: 10.1038/nm1489.

Previously, we reported that SALL4 was constitutively expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and SALL4 transgenic mice developed acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we aimed to survey SALL4 protein expression in benign and neoplastic hematopoietic tissues in addition to acute myeloid leukemia using immunostaining with a polyclonal anti-SALL4 antibody. Primary hematological tumors (178) and 15 benign hematopoietic tissues were examined. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was also performed to detect SALL4 mRNA expression on eight precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas, 10 benign hematopoietic tissues, and seven hematopoietic cancer cell lines. Of the benign tissues, SALL4 expression was detectable only in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (2/2 at protein level, 3/3 at RNA level). In neoplastic tissues, only precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas had detectable SALL4 (12/16 at protein level, 7/8 at RNA level), similar to that observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Of the seven cell lines examined, only those derived from acute myeloid leukemia and precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas were positive. To conclude, SALL4 expression is normally restricted to CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The persistence of SALL4 expression in leukemic blasts in precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas resembles to what we observed in acute myeloid leukemia, and correlates with the maturation arrest of these cells. We have shown in our previous study that the constitutive expression of SALL4 in mice can lead to acute myeloid leukemia development. The similar expression pattern of SALL4 in acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas suggests that these two disease entities may share similar biological features and/or mechanisms of leukemogenesis. More definite studies to investigate the role of SALL4 in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas are needed in the future to address this question.","['Cui, Wei', 'Kong, Nikki R', 'Ma, Yupo', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Lai, Raymond', 'Chai, Li']","['Cui W', 'Kong NR', 'Ma Y', 'Amin HM', 'Lai R', 'Chai L']","[""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital/Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/09/26 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['3800694 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.3800694 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2006 Dec;19(12):1585-92. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800694.

In DS-TL, peripheral blood analysis shows variable numbers of blasts and, usually, thrombocytopenia; other cytopenias are uncommon. Bone marrow characteristics of DS-TL are, likewise, variable, though (in contrast to other leukemias) the bone marrow blast differential can be lower than the peripheral blood blast differential. The blasts of DS-TL typically show light microscopic, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric evidence of megakaryocyte differentiation. DS-TL neonates have a approximately 15% risk of developing potentially fatal liver disease and show <10% incidence of hydrops fetalis. Additional manifestations of DS-TL include cutaneous involvement, hyperviscosity, myelofibrosis, cardiopulmonary failure, splenomegaly, and spleen necrosis. Despite its typical transient nature, 20% to 30% of DS-TL patients develop overt (nontransient) acute leukemia, usually within 3 years and typically of the M7 phenotype (acute megakaryoblastic leukemia). The pathogenesis of DS-TL (and of subsequent acute leukemia) involves mutation of GATA1 (on chromosome X), which normally encodes a transcription factor integral to normal development of erythroid, megakaryocytic, and basophilic/mast cell lines.

Here we present a method for the transduction of hES cells with ecotropic retroviral vectors. hES cells were transiently transfected with a construct carrying the murine retrovirus receptor mCAT1. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to replication-deficient Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) derivatives or pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. With oncoretroviral vectors, this procedure yields overall transduction efficiencies of up to 20% and permits selection of permanently transduced clones with high frequency. Selected clones maintained expression of pluripotency-associated markers and exhibited multi-germ layer differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. HES cell-derived somatic cells including neural progeny maintained high levels of transgene expression. Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the MoMuLV envelope could be introduced in the same manner with efficiencies of up to 33%. Transgene expression of lentivirally transduced hES cells remained permanent after differentiation even without selection pressure. Bypassing the regulatory issues associated with the use of amphotropic retroviral systems and exploiting the large pool of existing murine vectors, this method provides a safe and versatile tool for gene transfer and lineage analysis in hES cells and their progeny.","['Koch, Philipp', 'Siemen, Henrike', 'Biegler, Andrea', 'Itskovitz-Eldor, Joseph', 'Brustle, Oliver']","['Koch P', 'Siemen H', 'Biegler A', 'Itskovitz-Eldor J', 'Brustle O']","['Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, Life and Brain Center University of Bonn and Hertie Foundation, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (Trpv6 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Channels/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Germ Layers/cytology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'TRPV Cation Channels/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Transgenes']",2006/09/26 09:00,2006/12/19 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkl674 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkl674 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2006;34(18):e120. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkl674.

Little empirical data are available to support their various perspectives. We analyzed 140 audiotaped pediatric informed consent sessions, of which 95 (68%) included at least one discussion of how participation in a cancer clinical trial might benefit: 1) the pursuit of scientific knowledge generally; 2) other children with cancer specifically; and 3) ""the future"" and other vaguely defined recipients. Clinicians initiated most (80%) of these discussions of altruism. The enrollment rate of children in the clinical trial was high (83%) overall, but not higher among children whose parents were involved in an altruism-oriented discussion. These findings suggest that: (1) clinicians invoke a spectrum of altruistic considerations rather than a single monothematic notion of altruism, and (2) the effect of altruistic considerations on subsequent enrollment decisions is marginal. While further research on this topic is warranted, bioethical debate should strive to reflect the diversity of altruistic discourse in clinical research encounters and to place this discourse in the context of other, including nonaltruistic, considerations.","['Simon, Christian', 'Eder, Michelle', 'Kodish, Eric', 'Siminoff, Laura']","['Simon C', 'Eder M', 'Kodish E', 'Siminoff L']","['Case Western Reserve University, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Bioeth,The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,100898738,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Altruism', 'Child', '*Clinical Trials as Topic/ethics/standards', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Knowledge', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/therapy', '*Parents', '*Patient Selection/ethics', ""Physician's Role"", 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Tape Recording', 'United States']",2006/09/26 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['N47150325108LL13 [pii]', '10.1080/15265160600862395 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Bioeth. 2006 Sep-Oct;6(5):40-7. doi: 10.1080/15265160600862395.,,"['Am J Bioeth. 2006 Sep-Oct;6(5):48.

However, in addition to their radical-scavenging activity, phenolic compounds can chelate metal ions, such as iron, to prevent their participation in Fenton-type reactions, which lead to the formation of free radicals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of a phenolic-rich juice made from grapes, cherries and berries to protect human myeloid leukemia (U937) cells from oxidative stress caused by tert-butylhydroperoxide (tB-OOH). Preincubation of cells with extracts of the phenolic-rich juice at different concentrations (0-200 microM ferulic acid equivalents) for 3 h partially prevented cell death and abolished the DNA cleavage induced by tB-OOH. Moreover, when preincubating cells with the 100-microM juice extract (the dose that diminished cell death by around 50%), the partial prevention of tB-OOH-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening was observed. The radical scavenger antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylene-diamine (DPPD) and the intracellular iron chelator o-phenanthroline (o-Phe) were also tested to know whether protective effects depended on radical-scavenging or iron-chelating activities. o-Phe prevented cell death, DNA cleavage and ROS generation, whereas DPPD only prevented cell death, suggesting that phenolics in the juice afforded protection against induced oxidative stress, most probably by means of an iron-chelating mechanism.","['Garcia-Alonso, Francisco J', 'Guidarelli, Andrea', 'Periago, Maria J']","['Garcia-Alonso FJ', 'Guidarelli A', 'Periago MJ']","['Food Science and Nutrition Department, Faculty of Veterinary, University of Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, 30071 Murcia, Spain. fjgarcia@um.es <fjgarcia@um.es>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nutr Biochem,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,9010081,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Phenols)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)']",IM,"['*Beverages', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects', '*Fruit', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Phenols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide/*pharmacology']",2006/09/26 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0955-2863(06)00192-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jnutbio.2006.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr Biochem. 2007 Jul;18(7):457-66. doi: 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2006.08.003.

Acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) in elderly patients is now a frequent indication for RIC-HCT. The major reasons for these rapid developments have been on the one hand the high median age of patients with AML coupled with the unsatisfactory results with conventional chemotherapy, and on the other hand with the promising results already reported for RIC-HCT. Using RIC-HCT, overall survival rates at 2 years of 45-50% have been observed in patients with AML. This compares favourably with overall survival rates of 10-15% under chemotherapy in AML CR1, or no long-term survivors in patients >CR2. From the available data we conclude that RIC-HCT is a promising treatment for elderly patients with AML.

Several groups have shown that clinical-grade NK cells at doses up to 10(7)/kg may be collected and purified for the purpose of infusion to patients. Early results in a limited number of patients show that these cell doses may be administered without adverse events and possibly without inducing GvHD.

New strategies for GVL induction explore novel dosing regimens and both methods of enhancing GVL activity of donor T cells and of minimizing toxicity from graft-versus-host disease. Ultimately, the identification of the effector cells and target antigens for GVL induction will lead to the use of tumor-specific adoptive immunotherapy to both prevent and treat relapse with minimal toxicity.

This progress has been based mainly on intensification and optimization of chemotherapy, risk-adapted use of stem-cell transplantation, and improved supportive care. However, results in adult patients are still considerably inferior to those in paediatric ALL, and a barrier to further intensification of chemotherapy appears to have been reached regarding toxicity. More recently, the most significant progress has therefore been achieved by individualized and targeted therapy - for example, treatment with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). ALL blast cells express a variety of specific antigens which may serve as targets: e.g. CD19, CD20, CD22, CD33, and CD52. Most experience is available for anti-CD20 (rituximab). In ALL, rituximab is combined with chemotherapy mainly in mature B-ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma, and interim results are very promising. Recently studies with rituximab have also been initiated in B-precursor ALL. Other antibodies would be of interest due to a high rate of antigen (e.g. CD19) expression in ALL, but these are not yet generally available. Clinical application in smaller studies or case reports was reported for anti-CD52 and anti-CD33. Overall it can be stated that MoAb therapy in ALL is a promising treatment approach. Monotherapy with MoAbs in relapsed ALL has also occasionally achieved responses, but greater effects can be expected from combination with chemotherapy and treatment in the state of minimal residual disease. Details of these regimens - required level of antigen expression, timing, schedule, dosage and stage of disease - remain to be defined.","['Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D']","['J W Goethe University Hospital, Medical Clinic III, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany. goekbuget@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

To get an insight into the kinase selectivity of these compounds, their inhibitory activities toward Src kinase were evaluated.","['Conchon, Elisabeth', 'Aboab, Bettina', 'Golsteyn, Roy M', 'Cruzalegui, Francisco', 'Edmonds, Thomas', 'Leonce, Stephane', 'Pfeiffer, Bruno', 'Prudhomme, Michelle']","['Conchon E', 'Aboab B', 'Golsteyn RM', 'Cruzalegui F', 'Edmonds T', 'Leonce S', 'Pfeiffer B', 'Prudhomme M']","['Laboratoire SEESIB, Universite Blaise Pascal, UMR 6504 du CNRS, 63177 Aubiere Cedex, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Pyrazolones)', '0 (Pyridazines)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Kinases/*drug effects', 'Pyrazolones/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Pyridazines/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared']",2006/09/26 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0223-5234(06)00267-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2006.06.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2006 Dec;41(12):1470-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2006.06.012.

Patients were enrolled in E1900, an ECOG clinical trial for AML. The protocol was designed to collect bone marrow or blood for both cytogenetic and FISH studies at study entry (diagnosis). FISH for each patient was performed and utilized eight probe sets to detect t(8;21), t(9;22), t(11;var), t(15;17), inv(16), +8, -5/5q, and -7/7q. We analyzed 237 specimens with complete cytogenetic and FISH results. Results for each specimen were classified by probe set into one of six categories. The concordance rate between cytogenetic and FISH results ranged from 98 to 100% for all probe sets and kappa analysis for concordance had a p-value of <0.0001. The high level of agreement between cytogenetic and FISH results demonstrate the accuracy of a panel of eight FISH probe sets for the detection of significant abnormalities in AML. Data from this investigation support the use of FISH as an adjunct method to increase the yield of useful cytogenetic results in large cooperative trials and demonstrate the potential of FISH as a follow-up study of minimal residual disease in ECOG trials.","['Vance, Gail H', 'Kim, Haesook', 'Hicks, Gary A', 'Cherry, Athena M', 'Higgins, Rodney', 'Hulshizer, Rachael L', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Dewald, Gordon W']","['Vance GH', 'Kim H', 'Hicks GA', 'Cherry AM', 'Higgins R', 'Hulshizer RL', 'Tallman MS', 'Fernandez HF', 'Dewald GW']","['Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, 975 W.

A decline in expression of most BV family genes in both CD4 and CD8 T cells was observed after alemtuzumab treatment, which was followed by a gradual increase in most BV families during long-term follow-up. After treatment, CDR3-length polymorphism showed an even more restricted pattern in CD4 T cells compared with pretreatment, with a shift towards a monoclonal/oligoclonal pattern. The clonally restricted pattern was significantly reduced in CD4 (P < 0.01) but not in CD8 T cells. This was followed by a gradual increase in the number of peaks within the CDR3 region of the different TCR-BV families, i.e. a polyclonal repertoire, during long-term follow-up. A restricted CDR3 pattern became even more restricted after treatment, but normalised during unmaintained follow-up.

This study was designed to examine the apoptosis induced in human leukemia U937 cells by amrubicin and its active metabolite amrubicinol. Amrubicin, amrubicinol and other antitumor agents, such as daunorubicin and etoposide, induced typical apoptosis with characteristic nuclear morphological change and DNA fragmentation. Measuring the population of sub-G(1) phase cells, it was found that under conditions where cell growth was inhibited by either amrubicin or amrubicinol, U937 cells underwent apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner accompanied by an arrest of the cell cycle at G(2)/M. Furthermore, amrubicin- and amrubicinol-induced apoptosis was mediated by the activation of caspase-3/7, but not caspase-1, preceding a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These results indicate that both a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of caspase-3/7 are key events in the apoptosis induced by amrubicin and amrubicinol as well as the other antitumor agents. In addition, studies with oligomycin suggested that the apoptosis induced by amrubicin and amrubicinol involved substantially different pathways from that triggered by daunorubicin and etoposide. Oligomycin blocked the etoposide-induced increase in the number of sub-G(1) phase cells without preventing the activation of caspase-3/7, and had no inhibitory effect on the expansion of the sub-G(1) population in daunorubicin-treated cells, whereas apoptosis-related changes caused by amrubicin and amrubicinol were suppressed in the presence of oligomycin.","['Hanada, Mitsuharu', 'Noguchi, Toshihiro', 'Yamaoka, Takashi']","['Hanada M', 'Noguchi T', 'Yamaoka T']","['Pharmacology Research Laboratories, Drug Research Division, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, 3-1-98 Kasugadenaka, Konohana-ku, Osaka 554-0022, Japan. mitsuharu-hanada@ds-pharma.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (amrubicinol)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '93N13LB4Z2 (amrubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 7/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",2006/09/26 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS318 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00318.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2006 Dec;97(12):1396-403. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00318.x.

EVI1 gene is highly conserved through evolution and human gene EVI1 on chromosome 3q26 encodes zinc fingers-containing transcription factor. EVI1 is expressed in nonhematopoietic tissues but not in normal blood or bone marrow. EVI1 was detected in hematopoietic cells in retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemias in mice and several reports documented EVI1 expression in human myelodysplastic syndromes and other hematologic malignancies without 3q26 translocations. EVI1 is abnormally expressed in human myeloid leukemias that are associated with the t(3;3)(q21;q26), t(3;21)(q26;q22), inv(3)(q21q26) and other chromosomal rearrangements. EVI1 is overexpressed in some ovarian cancers and human colon cancer cell lines and may play a role in the initiation and/or progression of solid tumors, as well as hematopoietic malignancies. EVI1 is a transcriptional repressor which inhibits transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) family signalling by binding signal transducers (Smad proteins) and recruiting transcriptional corepressors. TGFbeta is an important regulator of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration of cells. EVI1 inhibits TGFbeta-mediated apoptosis. Knockdown of EVI1 function by small interference RNA increases the sensitivity of malignant cells to TGFbeta-mediated or other inducer-mediated apoptosis. Overexpressed EVI-1 blocks granulocyte and erythroid differentiation and possess the ability of growth promotion in some types of cells. EVI1 functions in some cases as a transcriptional activator which stimulates for example GATA2 and GATA3 promoters. The study of EVI1 target genes will help to clear the mechanism by which EVI1 upregulates cell proliferation, impairs cell differentiation, and induces cell transformation.","['Fuchs, O']",['Fuchs O'],"['UHKT, Praha. ota.fuchs@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",2006/09/26 09:00,2006/11/11 09:00,['2006/09/26 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2006;145(8):619-24.,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,"EVI1 a jeho uloha u myelodysplastickych syndromu, myeloidni leukemie a dalsich malignich onemocneni.",,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment modality, while the role of anti-leukemic therapy prior to HSCT is uncertain. A comparative evaluation of the efficacy of different clinical protocols and great variety of anti-neoplastic drugs applied pre-HSCT is hampered by the lack of uniform criteria of response. Classification schemas applied in other forms of leukemia are of little value, because in JMML therapy may result in divergent responses in solid organs compared to peripheral blood (PB). PROCEDURE: We therefore defined separate response criteria for white blood count (WBC), platelet count, liver size, and spleen size. We then retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of 129 treatment courses other than HSCT administered to 63 children with JMML. Treatment consisted of intensive therapy according to AML-type chemotherapy, maintenance-type combination therapy, and single agent therapy. To account for the variability observed in the natural course of disease, we also evaluated 32 episodes of ""no therapy."" RESULTS: Best responses within 3 months of initiation of therapy were highly variable for the four response criteria. In contrast to platelet count and liver size, there was a significant correlation between WBC or spleen size and therapy. Response rates for WBC and spleen size were best for purine analogs, etoposide, and cytarabine as single agents or for maintenance-type combination therapy. CONCLUSION: To rigorously test future therapeutic strategies in this rare disease an international consensus on the definition of response criteria will be helpful.","['Bergstraesser, Eva', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Rogge, Tim', 'Fischer, Alexandra', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Noellke, Peter', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M']","['Bergstraesser E', 'Hasle H', 'Rogge T', 'Fischer A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Noellke P', 'Niemeyer CM']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Liver', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/23 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21038 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;49(5):629-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21038.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

With increased survival, quality of life has emerged as an essential health outcome. This investigation examines the internal consistency reliability and construct validity of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Brain Tumor Module. METHODS: The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales, PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and PedsQL Brain Tumor Module were administered to 99 families. The average age of the 56 boys and 43 girls was 9.76 years (range=2-18 years). The sample included children with tumors located in the posterior fossa/brainstem (N=62, 62.6%), supratentorial (N=15, 15.2%), and midline (N=22, 22.2%). Children were on treatment (N=46, 46.5%), off treatment<12 months (N=19, 19.2%), or off treatment>12 months/long-term survivor (N=34, 34.3%). Treatment included radiation (N=61, 61.6%), surgery (N=83, 83.8%), chemotherapy (N=87, 87.9%), and bone marrow transplant (N=5, 5.1%). RESULTS: Internal consistency reliability was demonstrated for the 24-item PedsQL Brain Tumor Module (average alpha=0.78-0.92, parent proxy-report, n=99; average alpha=0.76-0.87, child self-report, n=51). Construct validity for the PedsQL Brain Tumor Module was supported through an analysis of the intercorrelations with the Generic Core Scales and Fatigue Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide support for the measurement properties of the PedsQL Brain Tumor Module.","['Palmer, Stephanie N', 'Meeske, Kathleen A', 'Katz, Ernest R', 'Burwinkle, Tasha M', 'Varni, James W']","['Palmer SN', 'Meeske KA', 'Katz ER', 'Burwinkle TM', 'Varni JW']","['Childrens Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Brain Neoplasms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatigue', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents', '*Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",2006/09/23 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21026 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Sep;49(3):287-93. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21026.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However the benefits of this agent in reducing disease progression and relapse rate cannot be sustained in the long-term, as treatment is limited by the potential for cumulative cardiotoxicity. We report our experience utilising Glatiramer Acetate as maintenance immuno-modulatory treatment following initial immunosuppression with Mitoxantrone in a consecutive series of 27 patients with very active relapsing remitting disease, eight of whom had experienced continuing relapse activity on first-line treatment. Duration of treatment with Mitoxantrone and thereby cumulative dose were reduced as our experience with the combination increased.No unanticipated side effects of combination treatment were encountered over a follow-up period of 66 months. A single patient developed therapy related acute leukaemia (TRAL) 9 months after completion of Mitoxantrone.A sustained 90% reduction in annualised relapse rate (p < 0.001) has been observed. Disability is stable or improved in all patients a mean of 36 (16-66) months from initiation of treatment. Early suppression of relapse activity with Mitoxantrone has been maintained at a mean of 22 months from last dose of this agent. Only two relapses have occurred in the cohort since withdrawal of Mitoxantrone, occurring in the two patients who had previously been treated with Glatiramer Acetate. In 9 of the first 10 patients treated, imaged a mean of 27 months after withdrawal of Mitoxantrone, no enhancing lesions were identified on MRI brain scans. Glatiramer Acetate appears a safe and effective option for continuing disease modification in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis treated with Mitoxantrone. The treatment protocol utilised in later patients in this series appears to have the potential to limit exposure to this agent.","['Ramtahal, Jason', 'Jacob, Anu', 'Das, Kumar', 'Boggild, Mike']","['Ramtahal J', 'Jacob A', 'Das K', 'Boggild M']","['The Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Lower Lane, Liverpool L9 7LJ, UK. j.ramtahal@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Neurol,Journal of neurology,0423161,"['0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '5M691HL4BO (Glatiramer Acetate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analgesics/*therapeutic use', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glatiramer Acetate', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*drug therapy', 'Peptides/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2006/09/23 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00415-006-0178-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurol. 2006 Sep;253(9):1160-4. doi: 10.1007/s00415-006-0178-z.

The mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) CXXC domain selectively binds nonmethyl-CpG DNA, and is required for transformation by MLL fusion proteins that commonly arise from recurrent chromosomal translocations in infant and secondary treatment-related acute leukaemias. To elucidate the molecular basis of nonmethyl-CpG DNA recognition, we determined the structure of the human MLL CXXC domain by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The CXXC domain has a novel fold in which two zinc ions are each coordinated tetrahedrally by four conserved cysteine ligands provided by two CGXCXXC motifs and two distal cysteine residues. We have identified the CXXC domain DNA binding interface by means of chemical shift perturbation analysis, cross-saturation transfer and site-directed mutagenesis. In particular, we have shown that residues in an extended surface loop are in close contact with the DNA.

It is not known whether the gained chromosomes are sufficient for leukemogenesis or if additional genetic aberrations are necessary. However, the suboptimal chromosome morphology of hyperdiploid ALLs makes detection of structural abnormalities difficult if using cytogenetic techniques; alternative methods are, therefore, needed. We performed array comparative genome hybridization (CGH) analyses, with a resolution of 100 kb, of eight cases of high hyperdiploid childhood ALL to characterize structural abnormalities found with G-banding/multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and to detect novel changes. The non-centromeric breakpoints of four rearrangements, including three translocations and one 1q duplication, were narrowed down to <0.2 Mb. Furthermore, four submicroscopic imbalances involving 0.6-2.7 Mb were detected, comprising two segmental duplications involving 1q22 and 12q24.31 in one case and two hemizygous deletions in 12p13.2-31 - including ETV6 - and in 13q32.3-33.1 in another case. Notably, FISH analysis of the latter revealed an associated reciprocal t(3;13)(q?;32.2-33.1). In conclusion, the array CGH analyses revealed putative leukemia-associated submicroscopic imbalances and rearrangements in 2/8 (25%) hyperdiploid ALLs.

The majority of these mutations are internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane region (JM). In addition, a minority of cases of AML are associated with mutation of the FLT3 activation loop (AL), typically involving codons D835 and/or I836. We hypothesized that other novel mutations of FLT3 could also contribute to leukemogenesis. We genotyped 109 cases of AML and identified two novel gain-of-function mutations. The first mutation, N841 H, is similar to previously described mutations involving amino-acid substitutions of codon 841. The other novel mutation, FLT3 K663Q, is the first AML-associated gain-of-function mutation located outside the JM and AL domains. Of note, this mutation was potently inhibited by Sunitinib (SU11248), a previously described FLT3 kinase inhibitor. Sunitinib reduced the proliferation and induced apoptosis of transformed Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3 K663Q. The potency of Sunitinib against FLT3 K663Q was similar to its potency against FLT3 ITD mutations. We conclude that FLT3 mutations in AML can involve novel regions of the TK1.

Here, we addressed whether alloreaction-derived cytokines may also lead to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blast differentiation. With this aim, supernatant (sn) harvested from major or minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) were used to culture French American Bristish (FAB) type M4 or M5 AML blasts. Our results showed that the secreted factors induced upregulation of CD40, CD54, and/or HLA molecules in AML blasts. Protein fractionation, blockade experiments and exogenous cytokine reconstitution demonstrated the involvement of TNF in the upregulation of CD54, CD40 and HLA-class II molecules, and of IFNgamma in the increase of HLA-class I and class II molecule expression. But, in line of its much higher levels of secretion, TNFbeta, rather than TNFalpha, was likely to play a preponderant role in AML blast differentiation. Moreover TNFbeta and IFNgamma were also likely to be involved in the AML blast differentiation-mediated by HLA-identical donor T-cell alloresponse against recipient AML blasts. In conclusion, we show herein that upon allogeneic reaction, TNFbeta secretion contributes, in concert with IFNgamma, to increase or restore surface molecules involved in AML blast interaction with T cells.","['Eljaafari, A', 'Van Snick, J', 'Voisin, A', 'Cormont, F', 'Farre, A', 'Bienvenu, J', 'Bernaud, J', 'Rigal, D', 'Thomas, X']","['Eljaafari A', 'Van Snick J', 'Voisin A', 'Cormont F', 'Farre A', 'Bienvenu J', 'Bernaud J', 'Rigal D', 'Thomas X']","['Cell Therapy Research Department, EFS-Rhone-Alpes, Lyon, France. assia.eljaafari@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blood Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/09/23 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404375 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404375 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Nov;20(11):1992-2001. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404375.

Gene expression profiles of APL cells obtained from 16 patients were compared to eight samples of CD34+-derived normal promyelocytes. Malignant promyelocytes showed widespread changes in transcription in comparison to their normal counterpart and 1020 differentially expressed genes were identified. Discriminating genes include transcriptional regulators (FOS, JUN and HOX genes) and genes involved in cell cycle and DNA repair. The strong upregulation in APL of some transcripts (FLT3, CD33, CD44 and HGF) was also confirmed at protein level. Interestingly, a trend toward a transcriptional repression of genes involved in different DNA repair pathways was found in APL and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reactor (PCR) in a new set of nine APLs. Our results suggest that both inefficient base excision repair and recombinational repair might play a role in APLs development. To investigate the expression pathways underlying the development of APL occurring as a second malignancy (sAPL), we included in our study eight cases of sAPL.

For this reason, WT1 is an attractive target for immunotherapy. Four peptide nonamers from WT1 have been identified by others to generate a WT1-specific cytotoxic response in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201 and A2402. However, as WT1 is a self-antigen, breaking tolerance is a potential obstacle to vaccination. Here, we use a strategy to circumvent tolerance by designing synthetic immunogenic analog peptides that could crossreact to the native peptides (a heteroclitic response). A number of synthetic peptides derived from nonamer sequences of the WT1 protein were designed in which single amino-acid substitutions were introduced at HLA-A0201 major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding positions. Several of new peptides could stabilize MHC class I A0201 molecules better than native sequences. Some analogs were also able to elicit WT1-specific T-cell recognition and cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes more effectively than native sequences. Importantly, T cells stimulated with the new analogs crossreacted with the native WT1 peptide sequence and were able to kill HLA-matched chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines. In conclusion, analog heteroclitic WT1 peptides with increased immunogenicity can be synthesized and are potential cancer vaccine candidates.","['Pinilla-Ibarz, J', 'May, R J', 'Korontsvit, T', 'Gomez, M', 'Kappel, B', 'Zakhaleva, V', 'Zhang, R H', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'May RJ', 'Korontsvit T', 'Gomez M', 'Kappel B', 'Zakhaleva V', 'Zhang RH', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/09/23 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404380 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404380 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Nov;20(11):2025-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404380.

Some of the chromosome aberrations, the recurrent balanced translocations or inversions, directly result in chimeric rearrangement of genes for hematopoietic transcription factors (class II mutations) which disturb cellular differentiation. Other genetic abnormalities in t-MDS and t-AML comprise activating point mutations or internal tandem duplications of genes involved in signal transduction as tyrosine kinase receptors or genes more downstream in the RAS-BRAF pathway (class I mutations). The alternative genetic pathways of t-MDS and t-AML can now be further characterized by a different clustering of six individual class I mutations and mutations of AML1 and p53 in the various pathways. In addition, there is a significant association between class I and class II mutations possibly indicating cooperation in leukemogenesis, and between mutations of AML1 and RAS related to subsequent progression from t-MDS to t-AML.

This eventually results in platelet release in conjunction with apoptosis of the remaining megakaryocyte. Recent studies have indicated that in low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), premature cell death of megakaryocytes may contribute to thrombocytopenia. Different cell death patterns have been identified in megakaryocytes in these disorders. Growing evidence suggests that, besides apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death, may also be programmed. Therefore, programmed cell death (PCD) can be classified in apoptosis, a caspase-dependent process, apoptosis-like, autophagic and necrosis-like PCD, which are predominantly caspase-independent processes. In MDS, megakaryocytes show features of necrosis-like PCD, whereas ITP megakaryocytes demonstrate predominantly characteristics of apoptosis-like PCD (para-apoptosis). Triggers for these death pathways are largely unknown. In MDS, the interaction of Fas/Fas-ligand might be of importance, whereas in ITP antiplatelet autoantibodies recognizing common antigens on megakaryocytes and platelets might be involved. These findings illustrate that cellular death pathways in megakaryocytes are recruited in both physiological and pathological settings, and that different forms of cell death can occur in the same cell depending on the stimulus and the cellular context.

Despite the recognition that several miRNAs play crucial roles in normal development and in diseases, little is known about their exact molecular function and the identity of their target genes.

For successful widespread introduction into the mainstream patient monitoring schedule, many procedural aspects of the complex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) technique for measuring BCR-ABL transcripts require optimization. Recommendations for harmonizing the differing methodologies have recently been proposed. These recommendations were designed to maximize reliability of analysis for clinical decision making and proposed the adoption of an International Scale of measurement. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence and supporting data for specific recommendations. These recommendations include use of the same source of cells, either blood or marrow, for analysis; for validation of equal PCR amplification efficiencies of cDNA and standards when using a plasmid to construct standard curves and for ensuring ongoing high-level performance by undertaking a quality assurance programme. Clinicians must know the measurement reliability of an RQ-PCR assay to be able to determine the significance of a change in BCR-ABL level. An assay with poor precision limits the clinical usefulness of results. International harmonization should establish RQ-PCR measurement of BCR-ABL as the best method for monitoring treatment response for patients with CML.","['Branford, S', 'Cross, N C P', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Radich, J', 'Saglio, G', 'Kaeda, J', 'Goldman, J', 'Hughes, T']","['Branford S', 'Cross NC', 'Hochhaus A', 'Radich J', 'Saglio G', 'Kaeda J', 'Goldman J', 'Hughes T']","['Division of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia. susan.branford@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'Quality Control', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2006/09/23 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404388 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404388 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Nov;20(11):1925-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404388.

In this study, we have analyzed the functional characteristics of anti-BCP-ALL effector T cells generated by co-culturing T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC) from allogeneic human stem cell transplantation (HSCT) donors. After 21-day co-culture with DC pulsed with CD40L+ apoptotic BCP-ALL blasts, T cells presented with both effector and central memory phenotype, and showed high and specific cytotoxic activity against leukemic cells (average lysis = 77%), mostly mediated by CD8+ T cells. Noticeably, growth of CD4 T cells was maintained (45% of total cells), which actively produced Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2), but not IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10. Anti-BCP-ALL T cells expressed CD49d and CXCR4 (implicated in the recruitment to bone marrow), and CD62L and CCR7 (involved in the migration to lymphoid organs). In accordance with this profile, T cells significantly migrated in response to the chemokines CXCL12 and CCL19. In conclusion, stimulation of T cells with CD40L+BCP-ALL cells-loaded DC not only elicited the generation of potent and specific anti-leukemic cytotoxic effectors, but also the differentiation of specific and functional Th-1 CD4 lymphocytes. These effectors are fully equipped to reach leukemia-infiltrated tissues and have characteristics to support and orchestrate the anti-tumor immune-response.","[""D'Amico, G"", 'Bonamino, M', 'Dander, E', 'Marin, V', 'Basso, G', 'Balduzzi, A', 'Biagi, E', 'Biondi, A']","[""D'Amico G"", 'Bonamino M', 'Dander E', 'Marin V', 'Basso G', 'Balduzzi A', 'Biagi E', 'Biondi A']","['Centro Ricerca M.

During normal lymphoid development, activation of the Notch signaling pathway poses a T-cell fate on hematopoietic progenitors. However, the transcriptional targets of the Notch pathway are largely unknown. We sought to identify Notch target genes by inducing Notch signaling in human hematopoietic progenitors using two different methods: an intracellular signal through transfection of activated Notch and a Notch-receptor dependent signal by interaction with its ligand Delta1. Gene expression profiles were generated and evaluated with respect to expression profiles of immature thymic subpopulations. We confirmed HES1, NOTCH1 and NRARP as Notch target genes, but other reported Notch targets, including the genes for Deltex1, pre-T-cell receptor alpha and E2A, were not found to be differentially expressed. Remarkably, no induction of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements or transcription of known T-cell specific genes was found after activation of the Notch pathway. A number of novel Notch target genes, including the transcription factor TCFL5 and the HOXA cluster, were identified and functionally tested. Apparently, Notch signaling is essential to open the T-cell pathway, but does not initiate the T-cell program itself.","['Weerkamp, F', 'Luis, T C', 'Naber, B A E', 'Koster, E E L', 'Jeannotte, L', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Staal, F J T']","['Weerkamp F', 'Luis TC', 'Naber BA', 'Koster EE', 'Jeannotte L', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Staal FJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nrarp protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (TCFL5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)', '93349-26-9 (1,2-dilinolenoyl-3-(4-aminobutyryl)propane-1,2,3-triol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Outbred Strains', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stromal Cells', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Triglycerides/pharmacology', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2006/09/23 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404396 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404396 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Nov;20(11):1967-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404396.

The phenotypic switch to angiogenesis is usually accomplished by a substet that induces new capillaries that then converge toward the tumor. The switch clearly involves more than simple upregulation of angiogenic activity and is thought to be the result of a net balance of positive and negative regulators. Tumor growth is although to require disruption of this balance and hence this switch must turned on for cancer progression. Progenitor endothelial cells, the crosstalk between angiogenic factors and their receptors and the interaction between vasculogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are all factors that may contribute to the switch. Its promotion is also the outcome of genetic instability resulting in the emergence of tumor cell lines. This review describes the history of the angiogenic switch illustrated in the literature and with particular reference to the three transgenic mouse models, namely RIP1-TAG2, keratin-14 (K14) (human papilloma virus) HPV16 and papilloma virus, used for stage-specific assessment of the effects of antiangiogenic and antitumorigenic agents.","['Ribatti, D', 'Nico, B', 'Crivellato, E', 'Roccaro, A M', 'Vacca, A']","['Ribatti D', 'Nico B', 'Crivellato E', 'Roccaro AM', 'Vacca A']","['Department of Human Anatomy and Histology, University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy. ribatti@anatomia.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Keratin-14)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Human papillomavirus 16/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Keratin-14/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/*blood supply/metabolism/pathology', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism']",2006/09/23 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404402 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404402 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):44-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404402.

Time from end of the last HDM to relapse was analyzed by Cox regression analysis with the logarithms of S-MTX and LV dose as exposures. The combined results from all risk groups suggest that high LV dose is related to higher risk for relapse. Doubling of the LV dose increased the relapse risk by 22% (95% confidence interval 1-49%, P = 0.037). High LV doses correlated with high MTX levels at 23, 36 and 42 h and longer elimination time.

In this study, we characterized the genomic structure of the EEN gene, including its 5' regulatory region and transcription start site (TSS). We found that Sp1 could bind to the guanine-cytosine (GC)-stretch of the EEN promoter and was critical for the normal EEN expression, whereas the leukemia-associated fusion protein AML1-ETO could aberrantly transactivate the EEN gene through an AML1 binding site. Of note, overexpressed EEN showed oncogenic properties, such as transforming potential in NIH3T3 cells, stimulating cell proliferation, and increasing the activity of transcriptional factor AP-1. Retroviral transduction of EEN increased self-renewal and proliferation of murine hematopoietic progenitor cells. Moreover, Kasumi-1 and HL60-cell growth was inhibited with down-regulation of EEN by RNAi.

Whereas the involvement of FcalphaRI in inflammation is well documented, little is known of its anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Here we show that monomeric targeting of FcalphaRI by anti-FcalphaRI Fab or serum IgA triggers apoptosis in human monocytes, monocytic cell lines, and FcalphaRI+ transfectants. However, the physiologic ligand IgA induced apoptosis only when cells were cultured in low serum conditions, indicating differences with induction of anti-inflammatory signaling. Apoptosis signaling required the FcRgamma ITAM, as cells transfected with FcalphaRI or with a chimeric FcalphaRI-FcRgamma responded to death-activating signals, whereas cells expressing a mutated FcalphaRI(R209L) unable to associate with FcRgamma, or an ITAM-mutated chimeric FcalphaRI-FcRgamma, did not respond. FcalphaRI-mediated apoptosis signals were blocked by treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, involved proteolysis of procaspase-3, and correlated negatively with SHP-1 concentration. Anti-FcalphaRI Fab treatment of nude mice injected subcutaneously with FcalphaRI+ mast-cell transfectants prevented tumor development and halted the growth of established tumors. These findings demonstrate that, on monomeric targeting, FcalphaRI functions as an FcRgamma ITAM-dependent apoptotic module that may be fundamental for controlling inflammation and tumor growth.","['Kanamaru, Yutaka', 'Tamouza, Houda', 'Pfirsch, Severine', 'El-Mehdi, Delphine', 'Guerin-Marchand, Claudine', 'Pretolani, Marina', 'Blank, Ulrich', 'Monteiro, Renato C']","['Kanamaru Y', 'Tamouza H', 'Pfirsch S', 'El-Mehdi D', 'Guerin-Marchand C', 'Pretolani M', 'Blank U', 'Monteiro RC']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U699, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (FCGR1A protein, human)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/pharmacology', 'Inflammation/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology/therapy', 'Mast Cells/physiology/transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Transfection']",2006/09/23 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52146-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-025882 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 1;109(1):203-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-025882.

Therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib (AMN107) and dasatinib (BMS-354825) has produced high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic response. Src kinase activation has been linked to Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis and CML progression. In addition to binding Abl kinase with less stringent conformational requirements than imatinib, dasatinib is a potent Src kinase inhibitor. In the current study, we report on 23 patients with CML (19 of them in accelerated or blastic phases) treated with dasatinib after treatment failure with both imatinib and nilotinib. More than half (13; 57%) of 23 patients responded to dasatinib: 10 (43%) had a complete hematologic response (CHR), including 7 (30%) who had a cytogenetic response (2 complete, 4 partial, and 1 minor).

Historically, splenectomy and interferon-alpha resulted in hematologic responses; however, responses tend to be short. The introduction of purine analogs dramatically changed the prognosis for most patients who hae HCL. It is now considered standard of care to use a purine analog, such as 2-CdA or 2'-DCF, as first-line therapy. This approach results in a high CR rate and prolong DFS. Although both agents yield the same rates of CR and survival, 2-CdA seems easier to administer and my be associated with less toxicity. Despite the excellent results with purine analogs, most patients have MRD detected by sensitive techniques; 30% to 40% of patients eventually relapse and most require further therapy. A repeat course of 2-CdA (or 2'-DCF) will result in CR in approximately 70% of patients. For patients who have relapsed or refractory disease, monoclonal antibody-based therapies are emerging options. Rituximab and BL22 are highly active in this setting. Until BL22 becomes widely available, rituximab is a reasonable choice for salvage therapy; however, the dosing schedule needs to be denied further. The roles of rituximab and BL22 as initial therapy for patients who have previously untreated HCL have not been investigated. Fig. 1 is a suggested algorithm for the treatment of HCL. With the introduction of effective new agents, further studies will determine whether the now achievable prolonged survival will translate into cure.","['Gidron, Adi', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Gidron A', 'Tallman MS']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 676 North St. Clair, Suite 850, Chicago IL, 60611 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Splenectomy/methods']",2006/09/23 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0889-8588(06)00111-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.hoc.2006.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2006 Oct;20(5):1153-62. doi: 10.1016/j.hoc.2006.06.004.,,,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have indicated that patients who are in complete remission have survivals that are comparable to those of normal age-matched controls. HCL-related mortality is distinctly uncommon. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that cladribine treatment of HCL is curative because MRD is common in the bone marrows of complete responders. Response criteria for HCL include clinical, hematologic, and morphologic criteria, but do not include flow cytometry, immunohistochemical analysis, or molecular studies. More sensitive techniques have been used by Filleul and colleagues to detect MRD. The used clonoegenic probes from the hypervariable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene and performed polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) on bone marrow biopsy specimens, All seven patients who were in morphologic complete remission after a single cladribine infusion were PCR positive. These data indicate that cladribine induces protracted remissions but is not necessarily curative. MRD can be detected in most patients when sensitive techniques are used. Persistence of immunohistochemical MRD may predict detected MRD remains to be studied in a large number of patients. Investigators from the University of Pisa in Italy have used a combination of cladribine and rituximab to eradicate MRD in patients who have HCL. Ten patients received treatment with a standard infusion of cladribine. Two patients achieved a complete remission, 6 patients achieved a partial remission, and 2 patients failed to respond. All were PCR positive for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene product at the completion of cladribine treatment. All 10 patients had achieved a complete hematologic response 2 months after the completion of ritximab therapy. The curative nature of this treatment will require long-term follow-up. Cladribine represents a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of HCL. The prognosis of patients who have HCL has improved greatly with cladribine therapy. Future strategies should address combination therapy with purine analogs and monclonal antibodies. These strategies should address eradication of MRD in an attempt to develop a potentially curative combination treatment program.","['Belani, Rajesh', 'Saven, Alan']","['Belani R', 'Saven A']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, M/S 217, Scripps Clinic, 10666 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/genetics', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/23 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0889-8588(06)00115-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.hoc.2006.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2006 Oct;20(5):1109-23. doi: 10.1016/j.hoc.2006.06.008.,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are important regulatory molecules in animals and plants. miRNA regulates gene expression by translational repression, mRNA cleavage, and mRNA decay initiated by miRNA-guided rapid deadenylation. Recent studies show that some miRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis processes that are important in cancer formation. By using multiple molecular techniques, which include Northern blot analysis, real-time PCR, miRNA microarray, up- or down-expression of specific miRNAs, it was found that several miRNAs were directly involved in human cancers, including lung, breast, brain, liver, colon cancer, and leukemia. In addition, some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. More than 50% of miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites, suggesting that miRNAs may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of a limited range of human cancers than previously thought. Overexpressed miRNAs in cancers, such as mir-17-92, may function as oncogenes and promote cancer development by negatively regulating tumor suppressor genes and/or genes that control cell differentiation or apoptosis. Underexpressed miRNAs in cancers, such as let-7, function as tumor suppressor genes and may inhibit cancers by regulating oncogenes and/or genes that control cell differentiation or apoptosis. miRNA expression profiles may become useful biomarkers for cancer diagnostics.

The predictive value of conventional pure-tone audiometry on early detection of ototoxicity has been questioned. Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) appear to be more sensitive to cochlear insult than the conventional pure-audiometry. The purpose of our study was (a) investigation the clinical usefulness of Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) as early indicator of chemotherapy-induced ototoxicity, (b) determination which of the protocols of chemotherapy is most ototoxic as measured by DPOAEs, (c) comparison of the short-term and long-term effects of chemotherapy on DPOAEs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tonal audiometry (0,25-8 kHz), immitance audiometry and DPOAEs were measured in 10 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Measurements were performed before and after each protocol of ALL IC-BFM 2002 chemotherapy: protocol I: vincristine (VCR), L-asparaginase (L-ASP), daunorubicin (DNR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), cytarabine (ARA-C), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX); protocol mM: 6-MP, MTX; protocol II: VCR, doxorubicin (DOX), L-ASP, CMP, ARA-C, thioguasine (6-TG), MTX; protocol III: VCR, DOX, L-ASP, CMP, ARA-C, 6-TG, MTX. DPOAEs were measured using ILO2 92 Otodynamics Analyser. Cochlear activity was evaluated by recording 2f1-f2 DPOAEs with L1 = 65 and L2 = 60 dB SPL. Comparisons of the DP-grams amplitudes were performed between baseline measurements and those recorded before and after each chemotherapy course. RESULTS: Our results indicate that: a)DPOAE is a more sensitive technique for the assess of chemotherapy-induced ototoxicity than conventional audiometry, b) with DPOAE monitoring very subtle hearing changes can be detected, c) DPOAE amplitude was significantly decreased at all frequencies studied in 50% children with leukemia, d) depression of DPOAE amplitude was evident only during and after first protocol, e) long-term DPOAE monitoring reviled reversibility of ototoxicity in all children, f) a large individual variability in the DPOAE response following the chemotherapy was observed, g) in a few cases a transient increase in DPOAE amplitude had been observed before it was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Distortion product otoacoustic emissions measurements are very sensitive on early detection of the changes in cochlear function and are recommended for monitor hearing in patients during chemotherapy.","['Lisowska, Grazyna', 'Namyslowski, Grzegorz', 'Hajduk, Agata', 'Polok, Aleksandra', 'Tomaszewska, Renata', 'Misiolek, Maciej']","['Lisowska G', 'Namyslowski G', 'Hajduk A', 'Polok A', 'Tomaszewska R', 'Misiolek M']",['Katedra i Oddzial Kliniczny Laryngologii w Zabrzu Sl.AM w Katowicach. grazyna.lisowska@powernet.com.pl'],['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Otolaryngol Pol,Otolaryngologia polska = The Polish otolaryngology,0404453,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Audiometry, Pure-Tone', 'Auditory Threshold/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cochlea/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hearing/*drug effects', 'Hearing Loss/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/23 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2006/09/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Otolaryngol Pol. 2006;60(3):415-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Badania emisji otoakustycznych u dzieci podczas chemioterapii z powodu ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej.,,,,

Studies on the leukemia cell lines.,483-8,"Four diterpenoids, ferruginol, salvipisone, aethiopinone and 1-oxoaethiopinone, were isolated from transformed roots of Salvia sclarea. Salvipisone and aethiopinone showed relatively high cytotoxicity against HL-60 and NALM-6 leukemia cells (IC50 range 0.6-7.7 microg/ mL which is equal to 2.0-24.7 microM), whereas 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were less active in this regard. Moreover, we have found that all four diterpenoids of S. sclarea had equal cytotoxic activity against parental HL-60 and multidrug-resistant HL-60 ADR cells, what indicates that they are poor substrates for transport by multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1). Caspase-3 activity determinations showed that salvipisone and aethiopinone were able to induce apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The results obtained in this study show that S. sclarea diterpenoids aethiopinone and salvipisone may be useful in the treatment of human cancers, especially in the case of drug resistance.","['Rozalski, Marek', 'Kuzma, Lukasz', 'Krajewska, Urszula', 'Wysokinska, Halina']","['Rozalski M', 'Kuzma L', 'Krajewska U', 'Wysokinska H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151 Lodz, Poland. mrozalski@pharm.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Given the high rates of clinical and cytogenetic remission achieved, the molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels by RT-qPCR has become always more important to assess minimal residual disease. Recently, recommendations for harmonizing current methodologies for detecting and measuring BCR-ABL transcripts in CML patients have been suggested. Studies of imatinib-treated patients have determined that the BCR-ABL levels measured early in therapy may predict durable cytogenetic remission and in turn prolonged progression free-survival or acquisition of resistance. The major mechanism of imatinib resistance is clonal expansion of leukaemia cells with mutations in the Bcr-Abl fusion tyrosine kinase. The early reduction of such mutations may allow timely treatment intervention to prevent or overcome resistance. We review current trends in the management of chronic myeloid leukaemia patients undergoing treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Martinelli G', 'Iacobucci I', 'Soverini S', 'Cilloni D', 'Saglio G', 'Pane F', 'Baccarani M']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. gmartino@kaiser.alma.unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', '*Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/22 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.792 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2006 Dec;24(4):196-204. doi: 10.1002/hon.792.,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New technologies, such as gene expression profile analysis, may allow us to further unravel the intrinsic biology of the disease, to improve diagnostic and prognostic stratification, and to design innovative therapeutic strategies. In potentially all cases, specific markers of the disease can be found and utilized together with the rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes to monitor minimal residual disease during clinical follow-up. These biologically-defined subgroups of patients may have a different clinical course, response to treatment and variable prognosis.

Studies in cell lines have demonstrated that triphosphate is the active metabolite for both these purine nucleoside analogs. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigations during clinical trials have verified the importance of triphosphate levels in achieving clinical responses. Several phase I and II clinical explorations have suggested the utility of clofarabine in acute leukemias and nelarabine in T-cell diseases. Dose-limiting toxicities were nonhematologic: hepatotoxicity for clofarabine and neurotoxicity for nelarabine. SUMMARY: Clofarabine is the first deoxyadenosine analog that shows promise in adult and pediatric acute leukemias without untoward toxicity. Nelarabine, as expected from its design, is a drug that may be directed to T-cell diseases.","['Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Clofarabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2006/09/22 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000245326.65152.af [doi]', '00001622-200611000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2006 Nov;18(6):584-90. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000245326.65152.af.,,,"['CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Imatinib therapy has significantly improved prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. A minority of patients with chronic-phase disease (4% annually) and considerably more in advanced stages develop resistance. This is attributed, in 40-50% of cases, to the development of BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region/Abelson oncogene) tyrosine kinase domain mutations that impair imatinib binding. This has led to the development of more potent novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors that can overcome both BCR-ABL-dependent and BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of resistance. Preliminary results of phase I and II trials with dasatinib and nilotinib have provided promising data that may reduce disease progression and potentially prevent acquired resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. SUMMARY: Novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors with more potent and selective Bcr-Abl inhibition and with multitargeted inhibition of Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases are promising and may further improve prognosis in chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/09/22 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000245314.97638.d3 [doi]', '00001622-200611000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2006 Nov;18(6):578-83. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000245314.97638.d3.,,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were treated with fludarabine phosphate 25 mg/m2/d (d1-5), Ara-C 2 g/m2/d (d1-5), idarubicin 12 mg/m2/d (d1-3), G-CSF was given subcutaneously from sixth day until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >500/microL. One third of the acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 45% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases were primary refractory disease. In AML patients, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 15 cases (53.6%). One case showed partial remission (PR) (3.6%) and 12 cases (42.8%) had resistant to this regimen (RD). Grade IV hematologic toxicity occurred in all AML cases. Leukocyte recovery time was 16 days. Nonhematologic complications were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, and mucositis and could be controlled by routine measures. Stem cell transplantation was performed in 5 patients and all achieved CR, 2 autologous and 3 allogeneic. In ALL patients, CR and PR were obtained in 8 (42.2%) and 2 (10.5%) of 22 cases; disease was resistant to Ida-FLAG in 9 (47.3%) cases. Grade IV hematologic toxicity occurred in all ALL cases. Leukocyte recovery time was 17 days. Nonhematologic toxicity consisted of nausea, vomiting, and mucositis and could be controlled by supportive therapy. Autologous transplantation was performed in 1 patient, but relapse disease occurred after 5 weeks. There was no correlation between response rate and leukemia subtype (AML versus ALL), leukocyte count, age, sex, disease status (de novo versus secondary), and RFS (early versus late relapse) (P > 0.05). Median survival was 16 weeks in all cases (22 weeks in AML versus 13 weeks). At present, only 3 patients are alive and 2 of these are in continuous remission. The rest of the patients died. In conclusion, Ida-FLAG is a good choice in cases with refractory/relapsing acute leukemia for salvage chemotherapy. High efficacy and a low-toxicity profile are preferable properties of this regimen, and this regimen has been found to be useful for cytoreduction, especially in candidates for allo-SCT.","['Yavuz, Sinan', 'Paydas, Semra', 'Disel, Umut', 'Sahin, Berksoy']","['Yavuz S', 'Paydas S', 'Disel U', 'Sahin B']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Cukurova University, Balcali-Adana, Turkey. siyav@cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ther,American journal of therapeutics,9441347,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Protocols', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2006/09/22 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.mjt.0000181690.21601.09 [doi]', '00045391-200609000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Ther. 2006 Sep-Oct;13(5):389-93. doi: 10.1097/01.mjt.0000181690.21601.09.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To look for STAT3-downstream target genes, we performed DD-RT PCR in the presence or absence of LIF. Through further confirmation, we finally selected 8 genes whose expressions were significantly dependent upon the presence of LIF. Among them, Jmjd1a was down-regulated after LIF withdrawal, and it was selected for further investigation. Its expression started to decrease 1 day after the removal of LIF, and disappeared on day 3. It was also shown that STAT3 could bind to the promoter region of Jmjd1a gene.

Females and males from manual compared with nonmanual childhood social classes were more likely to die from smoking-related cancers, stomach cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Males from manual compared with nonmanual social classes were more likely to die from unintentional injury, homicide, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The association with stomach cancer was little affected by adjustment for parental later-life and own adult social class or education. For other outcomes, educational attainment resulted in greater attenuation of associations than did adjustment for adult social class. Early-life social class was not related to suicide or to melanoma, colon, breast, brain, or lymphatic cancers or to leukemia. With the exception of stomach cancer, caused by Helicobacter pylori infection acquired in childhood, poorer social class in early life was associated with diseases largely caused by behavioral risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet.

Our understanding of the mechanisms that determine whether, where and when a stem cell will self-renew or differentiate is still limited, but recent advances have indicated that the stem cell microenvironment, or niche, provides essential cues that direct these cell fate decisions. Moreover, loss of control over these cell fate decisions might lead to cellular transformation and cancer.

Instead of considering a population of organisms, we can refer to a population of cells belonging to multicellular organisms. Many carcinogens are mutagens, and the observed geographic distribution of cancer is, at least in part, attributable to environmental mutagens. However, the rapid change in risk for some cancers after migration suggests that carcinogenesis involves--in addition to mutations--some late event that most probably consists of the selection of cells already carrying mutations. We review a few examples of such selective pressures: finasteride in prostate cancer, vitamin supplementation in smokers, acquired resistance to chemotherapy, peripheral resistance to insulin, and sunlight and mutations in melanoma. A disease model for such a hypothesis is represented by Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). Mutations can be present at birth, as in the case of PNH, and can have a frequency much higher than the occurrence of the corresponding disease (PNH or lymphocytic leukaemia in children). However, PNH does not require a mutator phenotype, only a mutant phenotype followed by selection. A characteristic feature of cancer, instead, is likely to be the development of the mutator phenotype. We propose a 'Darwinian' model of carcinogenesis. If the model is correct, it suggests that prevention is more complex than avoiding exposure to mutagens. Mutations and genetic instability can be already present at birth. Mutations can be selected in the course of life if they increase survival advantage of the cell under certain environmental circumstances. In addition, gene-environment interactions cannot be interpreted according to a simplified linear model (based on the 'analysis of variance' concept); experimental work suggests that a more comprehensive non-linear interpretation based on the idea of 'norm of reaction' is needed.","['Vineis, Paolo', 'Berwick, Marianne']","['Vineis P', 'Berwick M']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Norfolk Place, W2 1PG, London, UK. p.vineis@imperial.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,['0 (Mutagens)'],IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', '*Selection, Genetic']",2006/09/22 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyl185 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyl185 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2006 Oct;35(5):1151-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyl185.

METHODS: Fifty-two patients (mean age: 10.9 years) were assessed 6 weeks and 1 year after diagnosis with the TNO-AZL Questionnaire for Children's Health-Related Quality of Life. Parents completed the Brief Symptom Inventory. RESULTS: Compared to a community sample, patients reported more physical complaints, reduced motor functioning and autonomy, and impaired positive emotional functioning 6 weeks after diagnosis. HRQOL significantly improved over the year. However, at 1 year, patients still showed reduced motor and emotional functioning. At 6 weeks, children with leukemia were most affected. At 1 year, patients with brain tumors complained about more physical symptoms than the other groups. Intensity of treatment and presence of medical complications mainly influenced HRQOL at 6 weeks but less at 1 year. Parental psychopathology was associated with better cognitive functioning in the child. CONCLUSION: This prospective study found several domains of HRQOL to be compromised 6 weeks and 1 year after the diagnosis of cancer. Although HRQOL significantly increased over the year, there were important differences between diagnostic groups. The findings highlight the importance of repeated evaluation of HRQOL in children undergoing cancer treatment and consideration of specific differences between diagnostic groups.","['Landolt, Markus A', 'Vollrath, Margarete', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Gnehm, Hanspeter E', 'Sennhauser, Felix H']","['Landolt MA', 'Vollrath M', 'Niggli FK', 'Gnehm HE', 'Sennhauser FH']","[""Department of Psychosomatics and Psychiatry, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. markus.landolt@kispi.unizh.ch""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Psychometrics', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Sickness Impact Profile', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Switzerland']",2006/09/22 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-7525-4-63 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7525-4-63 [doi]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2006 Sep 20;4:63. doi: 10.1186/1477-7525-4-63.,20060920,,,PMC1590012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined the interaction between LIF and mGlu5 receptors using as a read-out the immediate early gene, c-Myc. The selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylenthynyl)pyridine (MPEP; 1 mum), reduced the increase in c-Myc protein levels induced by LIF by enhancing c-Myc ubiquitination. A reduction in c-Myc levels was also observed following small interfering RNA-mediated mGlu5 receptor gene silencing. MPEP reduced glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation on Ser9, but increased phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-K) substrate, AKT. In our hands, activated PI-3-K reduced the stability of c-Myc, because (i) the PI-3-K inhibitor, LY294002, prevented the reduction in c-Myc levels induced by MPEP; and (ii) over-expression of AKT promoted c-Myc ubiquitination. All effects of MPEP were mimicked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and reversed by the PKC activator, tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. We conclude that endogenous activation of mGlu5 receptors sustains the increase in c-Myc induced by LIF in embryonic stem cells by inhibiting both glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and PI-3-K, both effects resulting from the activation of PKC.","['Spinsanti, Paola', 'De Vita, Teresa', 'Di Castro, Sara', 'Storto, Marianna', 'Formisano, Pietro', 'Nicoletti, Ferdinando', 'Melchiorri, Daniela']","['Spinsanti P', 'De Vita T', 'Di Castro S', 'Storto M', 'Formisano P', 'Nicoletti F', 'Melchiorri D']","['Department of Human Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5)', '0 (Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate)', '7VC0YVI27Y (6-methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genes, myc', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5', 'Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology']",2006/09/22 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC4038 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.04038.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2006 Oct;99(1):299-307. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.04038.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, when viable AKR.H-2b spleen cells are cocultured with primed responder B6 antiviral precursor CTLs, the AKR.H-2b cells function as ""veto"" cells that actively mediate the inhibition by apoptosis of B6 antiviral CTL generation in a contact-dependent, MHC-restricted, and veto cell Fas ligand (FasL)/responder T cell Fas-dependent manner. In the present study we show that antigen-specific, antiviral CTLs that survive apoptotic inhibition by AKR.H-2b veto cells display a less activated cell surface phenotype, and are less able to bind specific MHC-peptide tetramers, including on a per-T cell receptor (TcR) basis. In addition, surviving antiviral CTLs also appeared to be functionally deficient, based on both their reduced ability to lyse specific target cells and to produce interferon (IFN)-gamma. Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining confirmed that AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTLs proliferated less extensively when AKR.H-2b veto cells were included in cocultures. AKR/Gross MuLV-specific effector CTLs as well as memory CTLs were each efficiently targeted for inhibition by AKR.H-2b veto cells. Attempts to enhance the quality of the priming by multiple in vivo immunizations did not alter the capacity of the AKR.H-2b cells to inhibit the antiviral CTL response. These results further characterize the nature of the interaction between veto cells and antiviral CTLs, and underscore the efficiency of veto cell-mediated inhibition of the CTL response.","['Rich, Robert F', 'Green, William R']","['Rich RF', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'H-2 Antigens', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*physiology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2006/09/22 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vim.2006.19.424 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 2006 Summer;19(3):424-33. doi: 10.1089/vim.2006.19.424.,,,"['AI 059580/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 82755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined CD56 expression in 37 adult de novo AML patients with t(8:21). CD56 was expressed in 25 cases (67.6%). Complete remission (CR) rates were similar in both groups (91.7% vs. 88.7%; P = 0.73), but the relapse rates differed considerably (60% vs. 25%; P = 0.02). The median duration of disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly shorter in the CD56+ (median, 12.2 +/- 6.4 months) than in the CD56- group (median, not reached) (P = 0.02). In addition, the median duration of survival differed significantly in the CD56+ group (median, 14.9 +/- 4.4 months) compared with the CD56- group (median, not reached) (P = 0.01). Of the fifteen transplanted patients who achieved CR, allogeneic HST was performed from their siblings. The median duration of DFS in the CD56+ patients was significantly shorter than the CD56- patients (median, 24.4 +/- 4.5 months vs. median, not reached; P = 0.02).

Previous studies incorporated irradiation, included adults and children, and excluded secondary leukemia. Herein we report long-term outcomes for adults with poor-prognostic AML receiving a novel regimen of busulfan (16 mg/kg), cytarabine (8,000 mg/m(2)), and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) (BAC), followed by URD BMT. From June 1995 through October 2001, 45 adults were enrolled. Adverse features included unfavorable cytogenetics (49%), secondary AML (47%), leukemia at transplant (42%), and extramedullary disease (16%). At time of BMT, 23 were in remission (12 CR1) while 22 had leukemia. Four (9%) died early. Acute and chronic GVHD rates were 44 and 67%, respectively. Seventeen (38%) were disease-free 52 months post-BMT; 13 were leukemia-free (eight CR1) at transplant. Eleven relapsed. Three-year DFS and OS were 42 and 46%, respectively. DFS and OS were longer, and relapses less, for those in CR at time of BMT. Secondary leukemia, cytogenetics, cell dose, and GVHD did not influence outcome. In poor-risk AML, BAC provided cytoreduction comparable to reported TBI-containing regimens, when administered for URD BMT. With decreasing treatment-related mortality, it is justified to proceed early to URD BMT for patients with poor prognostic features.","['Ayash, Lois J', 'Ratanatharathorn, Voravit', 'Braun, Thomas', 'Silver, Samuel M', 'Reynolds, Christopher M', 'Uberti, Joseph P']","['Ayash LJ', 'Ratanatharathorn V', 'Braun T', 'Silver SM', 'Reynolds CM', 'Uberti JP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. ayashl@karmanos.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'bio-adhesio-chemo protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Factor XIII/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/09/21 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2006/09/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20759 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2007 Jan;82(1):6-14. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20759.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm these observations the combination was tested in a multicenter Phase II trial in patients with melanoma brain metastases. METHODS: Eligible patients had melanoma brain metastases, with or without systemic metastases. The primary endpoint was response rate in brain metastases. Patients received temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 6 weeks with a 2-week rest between cycles, and thalidomide (escalated to 400 mg/day for patients age < 70 years or to 200 mg/day for patients age > or = 70 years). A 2-stage design required > or = 3 responses in the first 21 patients before enrolling 29 additional patients in the second stage. RESULTS: Sixteen eligible patients were enrolled. No objective responses were observed. The median survival was 23.9 weeks. Seven patients withdrew because of tumor progression; 7 were removed during Cycle 1 because of adverse events, including allergic reaction (1 patient), severe fatigue (1 patient), sudden death (1 patient), and thromboembolic events (pulmonary embolism in 3 patients and deep vein thrombosis in 1 patient); 2 patients withdrew when the study was suspended and subsequently closed. No associations could be established between baseline characteristics and toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with lethal or potentially life-threatening adverse events was high (0.31, 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.59), and the absence of objective responses made it unlikely that further accrual would demonstrate the efficacy of the regimen. These observations provide little support for the use of this combination for melanoma brain metastases unless safe and effective methods to prevent thrombosis are developed.","['Krown, Susan E', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Hwu, Wen-Jen', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Houghton, Alan N', 'Haluska, Frank G']","['Krown SE', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Hwu WJ', 'Hodgson L', 'Houghton AN', 'Haluska FG']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Embolism/chemically induced', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Temozolomide', 'Thalidomide/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Failure', 'Venous Thrombosis/chemically induced', 'Withholding Treatment']",2006/09/21 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/09/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22239 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Oct 15;107(8):1883-90. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22239.,,,"['CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['2006 American Cancer Society'],['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we present data on a total of 218 patients with chronic neutropenia, including 148 patients with CN (23/148 with secondary malignancies). We detected CSF3R nonsense mutations at 17 different nucleotide positions (thereof 10 new mutations) which lead to a loss of 1 to all 4 tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor. Of 23 patients with CN with signs of malignant transformation, 18 (78%) were shown to harbor a CSF3R mutation, indicating that these mutations, although not a necessary condition, are highly predictive for malignant transformation even if detected in a low percentage of transcripts. In serial analyses of 50 patients with CSF3R mutations we were able to follow the clonal dynamics of mutated cells. We could demonstrate that even a highly clonal hematopoiesis did not inevitably show a rapid progression to leukemia. Our results strongly suggest that acquisition of a CSF3R mutation is an early event in leukemogenesis that has to be accompanied by cooperating molecular events, which remain to be defined.","['Germeshausen, Manuela', 'Ballmaier, Matthias', 'Welte, Karl']","['Germeshausen M', 'Ballmaier M', 'Welte K']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany. germeshausen.manuela@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Anemia, Aplastic/genetics', 'Case Management', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/genetics', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/physiology']",2006/09/21 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/09/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52132-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-02-004275 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 1;109(1):93-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-02-004275.

Evodiamine exhibits antitumor activities against the human tumor cells, including multidrug-resistant tumor cells. However, the molecular mechanism involved in cell death induced by evodiamine treatment remains poorly understood. In the present study, we showed that evodiamine activated the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. This apoptosis was only partially inhibited by a pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, which suggested that evodiamine-induced apoptosis in leukemic U937 cells is partially caspase independent. We observed the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor in evodiamine-induced apoptosis of U937 cells, which may be responsible for the caspase-independent apoptotic execution. We next showed that evodiamine induced the substantial amount of apoptosis both in Bcl-2- and Akt-overexpressing U937 cells but not in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone inhibited caspase activity in Bcl-2-overexpressing U937 cells, it completely prevented neither the induction of apoptosis or the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, which suggests that evodiamine is, at least in part, able to bypass the resistance of leukemia cells via caspase-independent apoptotic pathways.

Multiple tumor cell lines of varying histiotypes, including A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), 786-O (renal cell carcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), MDA-MB-231 (breast), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia), MEC-2 (B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and U251 and D37 (glioma), as well as cells derived from primary human glioma tumors that are likely a more clinically relevant model were treated with sorafenib or bortezomib alone or in combination. Sorafenib and bortezomib synergistically induced a marked increase in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis, reflected by cytochrome c release, caspase-3 cleavage, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation in a broad range of solid tumor and leukemia cell lines. These findings were accompanied by several biochemical changes, including decreased phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, and Akt and increased phosphorylation of stress-related c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of Akt was required for synergism, as a constitutively active Akt protected cells against apoptosis induced by the combination. Alternatively, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 could also protect cells from apoptosis induced by the combination, indicating that both inhibition of Akt and activation of JNK were required for the synergism. These findings show that sorafenib interacts synergistically with bortezomib to induce apoptosis in a broad spectrum of neoplastic cell lines and show an important role for the Akt and JNK pathways in mediating synergism. Further clinical development of this combination seems warranted.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Friday, Bret B', 'Lai, Jin-Ping', 'Yang, Lin', 'Sarkaria, Jann', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Carter, Christopher A', 'Roberts, Lewis R', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Adjei, Alex A']","['Yu C', 'Friday BB', 'Lai JP', 'Yang L', 'Sarkaria J', 'Kay NE', 'Carter CA', 'Roberts LR', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Adjei AA']","['Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib']",2006/09/21 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/9/2378 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0235 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Sep;5(9):2378-87. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0235.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a structural analogue of cytarabine (araC), a clinically used drug in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, which has no or very limited efficacy against solid tumors. In comparison with araC, the excellent in vivo activity of T-araC against solid tumors suggests that, in addition to inhibition of DNA synthesis, T-araC may target cellular signaling pathways, such as angiogenesis, in solid tumors. We studied T-araC and araC for their antiangiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo. Both compounds inhibited human endothelial cell proliferation with similar IC50s. However, only T-araC inhibited endothelial cell migration and differentiation into capillary tubules. T-araC also abrogated endothelial cell extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation, a key signaling molecule involved in cellular processes of angiogenesis. Results from chick chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis assays revealed that T-araC significantly inhibited the development of new blood vessels in vivo, whereas araC showed much less effect. The findings of this study show a role of T-araC in antiangiogenesis and suggest that T-araC combines antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity in one molecule for a dual mechanism of drug action to achieve the excellent in vivo efficacy against several solid tumors. This study also provides important information for optimizing dosage and sequence of T-araC administration in clinical investigations by considering T-araC as both an antiproliferative and an antiangiogenic agent.","['Roy, Anshu M', 'Tiwari, Kamal N', 'Parker, William B', 'Secrist, John A 3rd', 'Li, Rongbao', 'Qu, Zhican']","['Roy AM', 'Tiwari KN', 'Parker WB', 'Secrist JA 3rd', 'Li R', 'Qu Z']","['Drug Discovery Division, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35205, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', ""YCO2764D5Z (4'-thio-arabinofuranosylcytosine)""]",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chorioallantoic Membrane/blood supply', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood supply/drug therapy']",2006/09/21 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/9/2218 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0048 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Sep;5(9):2218-24. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0048.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During exocytosis, a class of proteins termed SNAREs mediate secretory granule-plasma membrane fusion. To investigate the role of lipid rafts in secretory granule exocytosis, we examined the raft association of SNARE proteins and SNARE complexes in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. The SNARE protein SNAP-23 co-localized with a lipid raft marker and was present in detergent-insoluble lipid raft microdomains in RBL cells. By contrast, only small amounts (<20%) of the plasma membrane SNARE syntaxin 4 or the granule-associated SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-2 were present in these microdomains. Despite this, essentially all syntaxin 4 and most of VAMP-2 in these rafts were present in SNARE complexes containing SNAP-23, while essentially none of these complexes were present in nonraft membranes. Whereas SNAP-23 is membrane anchored by palmitoylation, the association of the transmembrane protein syntaxin 4 with lipid rafts was because of its binding to SNAP-23. After stimulating mast cells exocytosis, the amount of syntaxin 4 and VAMP-2 present in rafts increased twofold, and these proteins were now present in raft-associated phospho-SNAP-23/syntaxin 4/VAMP-2 complexes, revealing differential association of SNARE fusion complexes during the process of regulated exocytosis.","['Puri, Niti', 'Roche, Paul A']","['Puri N', 'Roche PA']","['Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Qa-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (SNARE Proteins)', '0 (Snap23 protein, rat)', '0 (Snap25 protein, mouse)', '0 (Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25)', '0 (Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 2)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cholera Toxin/metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology/pharmacology', 'Exocytosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gangliosidosis, GM1/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Qa-SNARE Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/agonists/metabolism', 'SNARE Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology/pharmacology', 'Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 2/metabolism', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2006/09/21 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/09/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRA490 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2006.00490.x [doi]']",ppublish,Traffic. 2006 Nov;7(11):1482-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2006.00490.x.

The historical experience with haploidentical stem cell transplantation has been characterised by the immunological consequences of crossing a major histocompatibility barrier, namely graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft rejection and impaired immune reconstitution. Ex vivo T-cell depletion of the graft may reduce the risk of GVHD, but at the expense of a higher risk of engraftment failure and relapse of the underlying malignancy. Myeloablative transplant strategies using vigorously T-cell-depleted 'megadose' stem cells appear to have improved the outcomes of selected patients with acute leukaemia. Non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation strategies, in which mixed chimaerism as a platform for adoptive cellular immunotherapy is intentionally induced, show promise for limiting GVHD and lessening transplant-related mortality. Future approaches, based on promising preclinical and early clinical observations, may include selective allodepletion of the graft, and manipulation of the cellular environment post-transplant using selected cellular populations or immunomodulatory soluble factors.","['Dey, Bimalangshu R', 'Spitzer, Thomas R']","['Dey BR', 'Spitzer TR']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', '*Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",2006/09/21 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2006/09/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6300 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06300.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Nov;135(4):423-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06300.x.

In each fused protein, the N-terminal NPM portion is associated with oligomerization of a partner protein leading to altered signal transduction or transcription. Recently, mutations of exon 12 have been found in a significant proportion of de novo AML, especially in those with a normal karyotype. Mutant NPM is localized aberrantly in the cytoplasm, but the molecular mechanisms for leukemia remain to be studied.

METHODS: Four patients with chronic myeloblastic leukemia (CML) and 4 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received allo-BMT with graft from 1 - 3 HLA-mismatched related donors. All patients were pre-treated with standardized conditioning regimen consisting of high dose Ara-c, cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan. Donors were given G-CSF 250 microg/d for 7 days prior to marrow harvest. To prevent GVHD, besides application of CSA and MTX, ATG 2.5 mg/kg was given everyday for 4 days before transplantation, and MMF 1.0 g per day starting from the 7th day after transplantation. Chinese medicine for replenishing qi and yin and strengthening Pi and Wei was administrated orally after transplantation. RESULTS: Successful haematopoietic reconstruction was seen in all patients.

METHODS: cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP were assessed in lymphoma cell lines, 240 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) tumors, and 40 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) tumors. RESULTS: All IAPs were expressed in most NHL and all HL cell lines. In NHL tumors, cIAP1 was expressed in 174 (73%), cIAP2 in 115 (48%), and XIAP in 37 (15%). cIAP1 was positive in all precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (LBL) and nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL), over 90% of follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and approximately 50% to 60% of myeloma, Burkitt lymphoma (BL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), small lymphocytic lymphoma/ chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL), extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT-lymphoma), splenic MZL, and mantle cell lymphoma. cIAP2 was positive in all MALT-lymphoma, over 90% of precursor B-cell LBL (94%), most BL (75%), LPL/WM (71%), and SLL/CLL (67%), and approximately 40% to 60% of follicular lymphoma, myeloma, and DLBCL.

T1 and G1 cells are isogenic melanoma cell subclones. We examined 22 000 spots, 4.2% of which displayed differential expression in G1 and T1 cells. Cell susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was found to be correlated with gene expression signatures in this model. Some of the differentially expressed genes were identified as involved in ATP-binding and signaling pathways, based on previously published data. Further analysis provided evidences that c-kit was overexpressed in G1 cells while it was absent in T1 cells. The c-kit inhibitor, imatinib, did not restore TRAIL sensitivity, excluding a role for c-kit in TRAIL resistance in G1 cells. Surprisingly, imatinib inhibited cell proliferation and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in melanoma cells. We investigated the possible involvement of several molecules, including c-ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), cellular FADD-like interleukin-1 alpha-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP)(L/S), Fas-associated DD kinase, p53, p21(WAF1), proteins of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family and cytochrome c. Imatinib did not modulate the expression or activation of its own targets, such as c-ABL, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta, but it did affect the expression of c-FLIP(L), BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2. Moreover, c-FLIP(L) knockdown sensitized T1 cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, with a sensitivity similar to that of cells previously treated with imatinib. More notably, we found that the resistance to TRAIL in G1 cells was correlated with constitutive c-FLIP(L) recruitment to the DISC and the inhibition of caspase 8, 3 and 9 processing. Moreover, c-FLIP(L) knockdown partly restored TRAIL sensitivity in G1 cells, indicating that the expression level of c-FLIP(L) and its interaction with TRAIL receptor2 play a crucial role in determining TRAIL resistance in metastatic melanoma cells. Our results also show that imatinib enhances TRAIL-induced cell death independently of BH3-interacting domain death agonist translocation, in a process involving the Bax:Bcl-X(L) ratio, Bax:Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-2 translocation, cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Our data indicate that imatinib sensitizes T1 cells by directly downregulating c-FLIP(L), with the use of an alternative pathway for antitumor activity, because PDGFRalpha is not activated in T1 cells and these cells do not express c-kit, c-ABL or PDGFRbeta. Caspase cascade activation and mitochondria also play a key role in the imatinib-mediated sensitization of melanoma cells to the proapoptotic action of TRAIL.","['Hamai, A', 'Richon, C', 'Meslin, F', 'Faure, F', 'Kauffmann, A', 'Lecluse, Y', 'Jalil, A', 'Larue, L', 'Avril, M F', 'Chouaib, S', 'Mehrpour, M']","['Hamai A', 'Richon C', 'Meslin F', 'Faure F', 'Kauffmann A', 'Lecluse Y', 'Jalil A', 'Larue L', 'Avril MF', 'Chouaib S', 'Mehrpour M']","[""INSERM, U753, Laboratoire d'Immunologie des Tumeurs Humaines: Interaction effecteurs cytotoxiques-systeme tumoral, Institut Gustave Roussy PR1 and IFR 54, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Melanoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",2006/09/20 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209738 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209738 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Dec 7;25(58):7618-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209738.

Etoposide-induced DNA double-strand breaks colocalize with the binding site of RNA polymerase II and the transcription initiation region, but not with a nearby Topo II consensus sequence.

Stem cell regulator C/enhancer binding protein (EBP)alpha is among such transcription factors known to be inactive in AML. This is either due to mutations or inhibition by protein-protein interactions. Here, we applied a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to systematically identify putative co-activator proteins interacting with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of C/EBP transcription factors. In our proteomic screen, we identified c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 among others such as PAK6, MADP-1, calmodulin-like skin proteins and ZNF45 as proteins interacting with DBD of C/EBPs from nuclear extract of myelomonocytic U937 cells. We show that kinase JNK1 physically interacts with DBD of C/EBPalpha in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that active JNK1 inhibits ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha possibly by phosphorylating in its DBD. Consequently, JNK1 prolongs C/EBPalpha protein half-life leading to its enhanced transactivation and DNA-binding capacity. In certain AML patients, however, the JNK1 mRNA expression and its kinase activity is decreased which suggests a possible reason for C/EBPalpha inactivation in AML. Thus, we report the first proteomic screen of C/EBP-interacting proteins, which identifies JNK1 as positive regulator of C/EBPalpha.","['Trivedi, A K', 'Bararia, D', 'Christopeit, M', 'Peerzada, A A', 'Singh, S M', 'Kieser, A', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Behre, H M', 'Behre, G']","['Trivedi AK', 'Bararia D', 'Christopeit M', 'Peerzada AA', 'Singh SM', 'Kieser A', 'Hiddemann W', 'Behre HM', 'Behre G']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, Department of Internal Medicine IV, State Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, SA, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proteome', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Ubiquitin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2006/09/20 09:00,2007/05/09 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209964 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209964 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Mar 15;26(12):1789-801. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209964.

To investigate the potential role of BCR-ABLp190 cessation in leukaemia development, we generated mice carrying a tetracycline-repressible BCR-ABLp190 transgene. These mice were morphologically normal at birth, and developed leukaemias. Disease was characterized by the presence of B-cell blasts co-expressing myeloid markers, reminiscent of the human counterpart. BCR-ABLp190 activation can initiate leukaemia in both young and adult mice. Transitory expression of BCR-ABLp190 is enough to develop leukaemia. Suppression of the BCR-ABLp190 transgene in leukaemic CombitTA-p190 mice did not rescue the malignant phenotype, indicating that BCR-ABLp190 is not required to maintain the disease in mice. Similar results were obtained by inactivation of BCR-ABLp190 with STI571 (Gleevec; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ, USA) in leukaemic CombitTA-p190 mice. However, gradual suppression of BCR-ABLp190 in leukaemic CombitTA-p190 mice identified a minimum level of BCR-ABLp190 expression necessary to revert the specific block in B-cell differentiation in the leukaemic cells. Overall, the findings indicate that BCR-ABLp190 appears to cause epigenetic and/or genetic changes in tumour-maintaining cells that render them insensitive to BCR-ABLp190 inactivation.","['Perez-Caro, M', 'Gutierrez-Cianca, N', 'Gonzalez-Herrero, I', 'Lopez-Hernandez, I', 'Flores, T', 'Orfao, A', 'Sanchez-Martin, M', 'Gutierrez-Adan, A', 'Pintado, B', 'Sanchez-Garcia, I']","['Perez-Caro M', 'Gutierrez-Cianca N', 'Gonzalez-Herrero I', 'Lopez-Hernandez I', 'Flores T', 'Orfao A', 'Sanchez-Martin M', 'Gutierrez-Adan A', 'Pintado B', 'Sanchez-Garcia I']","['Laboratorio 13, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Unamuno, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype']",2006/09/20 09:00,2007/05/09 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209968 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209968 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Mar 15;26(12):1702-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209968.

There have been clinically significant changes in method of diagnosis, prognostic tools, supportive care, and treatment over the past 2 decades. Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia now have Rai stage 0 or I disease at diagnosis. Patients with early-stage disease are a heterogeneous group: Approximately 30% to 50% will have accelerated disease progression, and the remainder may live for decades and possibly never require therapy. Recent insights into the biological characteristics of leukemic B cells have led to the discovery of new prognostic tools (immunoglobulin variable-region heavy chain gene mutation status, cytogenetic abnormalities assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and Z-chain-associated protein kinase-70 protein expression) that can identify patients with early-stage disease who are at high risk for early disease progression. These tools allow physicians to individualize counseling, follow-up, and management on the basis of disease risk. In addition, new treatments developed over the past 2 decades (purine nucleoside analogues, monoclonal antibodies, and combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens) have dramatically improved response rates and appear to prolong survival. In this review, the authors discuss the current work-up of lymphocytosis and highlight how to use recently identified prognostic tools to stratify risk in patients with newly diagnosed, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Recommendations for patient counseling, follow-up, supportive care, and initial treatment are presented for each risk category.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Byrd, John C', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Byrd JC', 'Call TG', 'Zent CS', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytosis/etiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/10/04 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['145/6/435 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-145-6-200609190-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2006 Sep 19;145(6):435-47. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-145-6-200609190-00007.,,,"['CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA90628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, therapy for standard risk patients was intensified by addition of a second induction, HAM (high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventy-three patients younger than 18 years with de novo AML were enrolled in trial AML-BFM 98. Patients received five courses of intensive chemotherapy, cranial irradiation, and 1-year maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Four hundred eighteen patients (88%) achieved remission. Compared with trial AML-BFM 93, early deaths decreased from 7.4 to 3.2% (P = .005), and 5-year overall survival increased from 58% to 62% (log-rank P = .03). Both types of consolidation therapy led to similar outcome (event-free survival, 51% v 50%), but in the two-cycle arm, treatment duration was shorter (median duration, 15 days), and treatment related mortality was lower (five v nine patients). G-CSF shortened neutropenia, but did not reduce the rate of severe infections. Intensification of induction therapy did not improve prognosis of standard-risk patients (event-free survival, 62% v 67%). CONCLUSION: Overall results were improved by neither the administration of G-CSF nor by cycle therapy; however, the latter was easier to perform. Compared with study AML-BFM 93, therapy intensification with HAM in standard-risk patients did not result in improved prognosis. Future treatment designs have to balance intensification of treatment with higher toxicity, improve supportive care, and to consider alternative treatment strategies.","['Creutzig, Ursula', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Graf, Norbert', 'Hermann, Johann', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Ritter, Jorg', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Stary, Jan', 'Reinhardt, Dirk']","['Creutzig U', 'Zimmermann M', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Graf N', 'Hermann J', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Reiter A', 'Ritter J', 'Dworzak M', 'Stary J', 'Reinhardt D']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Muenster, Germany. ursula@creutzig.de""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/27/4499 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.06.5037 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Sep 20;24(27):4499-506. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.5037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened a human testis cDNA library with sera from three polycythemia vera patients who responded to IFN-alpha and identified a novel Ag, MPD6. MPD6 belongs to the group of cryptic Ags without conventional genomic structure and is encoded by a cryptic open reading frame located in the 3'-untranslated region of myotrophin mRNA. MPD6 elicits IgG Ab responses in a subset of polycythemia vera patients, as well as patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer, suggesting that it is broadly immunogenic. The expression of myotrophin-MPD6 transcripts was up-regulated in some tumor cells, but only slightly increased in K562 cells in response to IFN-alpha treatment. By using bicistronic reporter constructs, we showed that the translation of MPD6 was mediated by a novel internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of the MPD6 reading frame. Furthermore, the MPD6-IRES-mediated translation, but not myotrophin-MPD6 transcription, was significantly up-regulated in response to IFN-alpha stimulation. These findings demonstrate that a novel IRES-mediated mechanism may be responsible for the translation of unconventional self-Ag MPD6 in responsive to IFN-alpha stimulation. The eliciting antitumor immune response against unconventional Ag MPD6 in patients with myeloproliferative diseases suggests MPD6 as a potential target of novel immunotherapy.","['Xiong, Zeyu', 'Liu, Enli', 'Yan, Yan', 'Silver, Richard T', 'Yang, Fan', 'Chen, Irene H', 'Chen, Yangyang', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Wang, Hong', 'Prchal, Josef', 'Yang, Xiao-Feng']","['Xiong Z', 'Liu E', 'Yan Y', 'Silver RT', 'Yang F', 'Chen IH', 'Chen Y', 'Verstovsek S', 'Wang H', 'Prchal J', 'Yang XF']","['Department of Pharmacology, Temple University School of Medicine, 3420 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (myotrophin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polycythemia Vera/*immunology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/immunology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomes/chemistry/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Testis/physiology']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/7/4907 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.7.4907 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Oct 1;177(7):4907-16. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.7.4907.,,,"['K08 AI054514/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 054514/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3902139,,,['NIHMS546793'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of JAKs, all JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2), JAK2, or JAK3, caused a significant reduction in cell growth with a major G2-M arrest evident 24 hours after treatment. Targeting all JAKs also caused endoreduplication 48 and 72 hours after treatment. We discovered mitotic cells in both G2 (4N DNA) and G4 (8N DNA) subpopulations of cells treated with an inhibitor of all JAKs as detected by phosphorylated histone H3 expression. Treatment with inhibitors of just JAK2 or JAK3 drastically reduced such mitotic cells. We observed a complete blockage of IFN-gamma and interleukin-6-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 and STAT-3 response when all JAKs were inhibited. At the same time, we found baseline phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 to be elevated by JAK inhibition, particularly when all JAKs were inhibited. The G2-M arrest and endoreduplication induced by JAK inhibitors were reduced in cells pretreated with PD98059 to inhibit ERK. PD98059 also increased back the expression of the MAD2 cell cycle checkpoint protein that was down-regulated during ""all JAKs inhibitor""-mediated endoreduplication.

Recent studies have shown that etoposide-induced DSBs occur predominantly within the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of the MLL gene. However, bcr-specific DSBs induced by etoposide are not topoisomerase II-linked but the result of apoptotic nuclease-mediated DNA cleavage. Here, we test the involvement of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) and other apoptotic components in etoposide-induced gene rearrangements using two methods. First, we measured the effect of etoposide on the integration frequency of a transfected plasmid. Etoposide strongly stimulated plasmid integration in CAD cDNA-complemented mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) but not in CAD knockout (KO) MEFs. Consistently, down-regulation of ICAD (inhibitor of CAD, also required for proper folding of CAD) in an HT29-derived cell line, which leads to decreased CAD activity, significantly reduced etoposide-induced plasmid integration. Second, we used long-template inverse PCR to focus on gene rearrangements at the MLL locus. Etoposide stimulated MLL fusion product formation in CAD cDNA-complemented MEFs but not in CAD KO MEFs. Together, these results suggest that CAD and other apoptotic components may play an important role in etoposide-induced t-AML.","['Hars, Eszter S', 'Lyu, Yi Lisa', 'Lin, Chao-Po', 'Liu, Leroy F']","['Hars ES', 'Lyu YL', 'Lin CP', 'Liu LF']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Deoxyribonucleases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Rearrangement/drug effects', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/18/8975 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1724 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Sep 15;66(18):8975-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1724.,,,"['CA102463/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: DCs were pulsed with C1498 lysate prior to intravenous administration 14 and 7 days prior to tumor challenge. Separate cohorts received DCs electrically fused to irradiated C1498 cells. Cohorts were administered DCs that were lysate-pulsed or fused with tumor cells on days 14 and 7 prior to tumor injection. Some cohorts were co-injected with CpG 7909 at the time of DC administration. RESULTS: All DC vaccines significantly improved survival (p < 0.01) vs nonvaccinated controls. There was no difference in the antitumor protective response between mice that received pulsed vs fused DCs (47% vs 45% survival). Both DC vaccines generated a fivefold increase in splenic tumor-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells and significantly (p < 0.05) higher mean frequencies of IFN-gamma-producing splenocytes compared to controls. CpG 7909 improved the survival of mice receiving the fused DCs (p < 0.05) but not the pulsed DCs. Surviving mice were rechallenged and found to be resistant to lethal tumor injection. CONCLUSIONS: DC vaccine strategies may be effective in generating anti-AML responses. No advantage was observed between lysate-pulsed and tumor cell-fused DCs.

JTE-607 is a multiple cytokine inhibitor that potently suppresses production of proinflammatory cytokines. In the present study, we investigated the potency of JTE-607 as an antileukemic agent by exploiting a SCID mouse acute leukemia model. METHODS: SCID mice injected with anti-asialo-GM1 antibody were exposed to sublethal total-body irradiation at a dose of 3 Gy and then inoculated intravenously with AML cells. JTE-607 was administered using osmotic minipumps. The effects of JTE-607 on mouse survival time, human interleukin (IL)-8 levels in mouse plasma, and proportion of human CD45(+) cells in the bone marrow were studied. RESULTS: The survival time of the mice was strictly dependent on the number of U-937 cells proliferating in vivo. Administration of JTE-607 during the initial 7 days significantly prolonged survival of the mice, suggesting killing activity of JTE-607 against AML cells in vivo. Delayed administration of JTE-607 also prolonged the survival of mice bearing established leukemia with an effect comparable to the maximum tolerable dose of cytarabine. Flow cytometer analysis of bone marrow cells revealed decreased number of human CD45(+) cells. Human IL-8 level was also reduced by JTE-607. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that JTE-607 has potential to be a new class of antileukemic drug that exerts inhibitory activities against both the proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production of AML cells.","['Uesato, Naofumi', 'Fukui, Kenji', 'Maruhashi, Junji', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Tajima, Nobuyuki']","['Uesato N', 'Fukui K', 'Maruhashi J', 'Tojo A', 'Tajima N']","['Biological and Pharmacological Laboratories, Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Japan Tobacco Inc., Osaka, Japan. naofumi.uesato@ims.jti.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (JTE 607)', '0 (Piperazines)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00333-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Oct;34(10):1385-92. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to enhance these effects, we introduced additional hydroxyl moieties into the molecule. In the present study, the activity of a novel RV analog, 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene (M8), was investigated in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity of M8 alone or in combination with Ara-C was assessed employing growth inhibition assays. Effects of M8 on nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) were examined by HPLC. The apoptotic potential of M8 and RV was compared using a specific double-staining method and inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB was studied. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by FACS. RESULTS: Addition of ascorbic acid decreased the IC(50) value of M8 from 6.25 microM to 2 microM. M8 depleted dATP and dTTP pools to 41% and 21% of control values, whereas dCTP pools increased to 199% of untreated controls. In addition, TTP, ATP, CTP, and GTP concentrations were decreased while UTP concentrations increased. M8 induced apoptosis at concentrations significantly lower than RV and could remarkably inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB. M8 arrested cells in the S phase of the cell cycle while depleting cells in the G2-M phase and exhibited synergistic combination effects when applied simultaneously with Ara-C. CONCLUSION: Due to these promising results, this novel polyhydroxylated stilbene derivative might become an additional option for the treatment of leukemia and therefore deserves further preclinical and in vivo testing.","['Horvath, Zsuzsanna', 'Murias, Marek', 'Saiko, Philipp', 'Erker, Thomas', 'Handler, Norbert', 'Madlener, Sibylle', 'Jaeger, Walter', 'Grusch, Michael', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, Monika', 'Krupitza, Georg', 'Szekeres, Thomas']","['Horvath Z', 'Murias M', 'Saiko P', 'Erker T', 'Handler N', 'Madlener S', 'Jaeger W', 'Grusch M', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Krupitza G', 'Szekeres T']","['Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, General Hospital of Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"[""0 (3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene)"", '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '01Y4A2QXY0 (Pyrogallol)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Pyrogallol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Resveratrol', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Wine']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00335-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Oct;34(10):1377-84. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied whether a similar relationship between JNK and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) describes acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: By immunoprecipitation, Flt3 was found to be activated and identified as the potential origin of JNK activity in a heavy majority of JNK+ve AML blasts tested. Often, Flt3 activity is associated with activating mutation of the gene locus. However, statistical linkage tied JNK activity with Flt3 expression levels rather than with mutation. An adaptor network to describe the signal cascade Flt3-to-JNK was uncovered. RESULTS: Active Flt3 was linked to p85 phosphoinositide-3 (PI-3) kinase, and p85 with cbl and CrkII/CrkL by co-immunoprecipitaton assays from lysates of model cell lines and primary AML blasts. JNK1 co-immunoprecipitated from such lysates with p85-cbl-crkII/L and bound to Crk species SH3 domain in pull-down assay. siRNA-mediated depletion of Flt3 or of cbl, the adaptor at the nexus of this signaling group, inhibited JNK activity on substrate c-jun. Within AML blast cells influenced by Flt3 signaling, selective inhibition of JNK by a small molecule inhibitor, led to proliferative inhibition, apoptosis, and sensitizing cells to the anthracycline, daunorubicin. These effects occurred upon JNK inhibition without off-target inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or AKT pathways, and p38-kinase activation, an effector in the p53/p14 arf tumor suppressor pathway, was also maintained or augmented. CONCLUSION: JNK is a bonafide signaling pathway from Flt3 in AML whose function for proliferation and survival is required in a significant AML cohort with active Flt3 signaling, by mutation or overexpression of Flt3.","['Hartman, Amy D', 'Wilson-Weekes, Annique', 'Suvannasankha, Attaya', 'Burgess, Gem S', 'Phillips, Carissa A', 'Hincher, Katie J', 'Cripe, Larry D', 'Boswell, H Scott']","['Hartman AD', 'Wilson-Weekes A', 'Suvannasankha A', 'Burgess GS', 'Phillips CA', 'Hincher KJ', 'Cripe LD', 'Boswell HS']","['Walther Cancer Institute, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/metabolism', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00336-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Oct;34(10):1360-76. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we compared the results obtained with MSC as a feeder layer to traditional allogeneic stromal layers grown in long-term bone marrow culture media (LT-ST). METHODS: Adult human bone marrow CD34(+)-enriched cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 2 to 3 weeks over the respective MSC-irradiated feeder layers or over traditional allogeneic LT- ST stromal layers in the presence of stem cell factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and Flt-3 and analyzed every 2 to 4 days for expansion, phenotype, and clonogenic ability. RESULTS: There was a progressive expansion of total numbers of cells in all the experimental groups; however, allogeneic MSCs were more efficient at expanding CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and showed a higher clonogenic potential than both allogeneic LT-ST and autologous MSCs. The differentiative potential of cells cultured on both MSC and LT-ST was primarily shifted toward myeloid lineage; however, only MSCs were able to maintain/expand a CD7(+) population with lymphocytic potential. Importantly, transplantation into preimmune fetal sheep demonstrated that the HSCs cultured over MSCs retained their engraftment capability. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that purified Stro-1(+) MSCs may be used as a universal and reproducible stromal feeder layer to efficiently expand and maintain human bone marrow HSCs ex vivo.","['Goncalves, Raquel', 'Lobato da Silva, Claudia', 'Cabral, Joaquim M S', 'Zanjani, Esmail D', 'Almeida-Porada, Graca']","['Goncalves R', 'Lobato da Silva C', 'Cabral JM', 'Zanjani ED', 'Almeida-Porada G']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Growth Substances)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/09/20 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00496-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Oct;34(10):1353-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.024.,,,"['HL 70566-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 73737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-cost biologics and other new drug therapies are often injectables and therefore have not presented cost threats to pharmacy benefits. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of capecitabine, an oral form of fluorouracil, in 1998, and imatinib mesylate in oral dose form for chronic myeloid leukemia, in 2001, signaled a new period in budget forecasting for pharmacy benefits, particularly for small, self-insured employers for whom a drug with a cost of 25,000 dollars per year of therapy for 1 patient could increase total pharmacy benefit costs by 10% or more. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the actual relative costs of the oral chemotherapy drugs in pharmacy benefits in 2006 and identify the history of spending on oral chemotherapy drugs relative to total pharmacy benefit spending for small, self-insured employers over the 4.5 years through May 2006. METHODS: Administrative pharmacy claims from the database of a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) for approximately 500,000 members of small, self-insured employer plans were used to calculate the net plan cost of oral chemotherapy drugs relative to total drug benefit costs for the period January 1, 2002, through May 31, 2006. Current costs for oral chemotherapy drugs for small employers were compared with an insured health plan of approximately the same number of members for dates of service January 1, 2006, through May 31, 2006. RESULTS: This descriptive analysis found that oral chemotherapy drugs represented 0.27% of total drug benefit costs, or approximately 0.08 dollars per member per month (PMPM) for small, self-insured employers in 2002, rising linearly to 0.73%, or approximately 0.24 dollars PMPM in the first 5 months of 2006. Members in pharmacy benefit plans sponsored by small employers paid an average 6.9% cost share for oral chemotherapy drugs in 2006, nearly identical to the average 8.5% paid by members of an insured health plan of similar size in total membership, versus 26.9% average cost share for all drugs. Imatinib mesylate accounted for 45% of total spending on oral chemotherapy agents in 2002 versus 40% in 2006. CONCLUSION: Spending on oral chemotherapy drugs as a proportion of total pharmacy benefit costs has more than doubled, from about 0.3% in 2002 to 0.7% in 2006. For small, self-insured employers, this represents a nearly 3-fold increase in spending, from about 0.08 dollars PMPM in 2002 to about 0.24 dollars PMPM in 2006.","['Curtiss, Frederic R']",['Curtiss FR'],"['JMCP, 100 North Pitt Street, Alexandira, VA 22314, USA. fcurtiss@amcp.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Manag Care Pharm,Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP,9605854,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['*Administration, Oral', 'Ambulatory Care/economics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*economics', 'Benzamides', 'Benzenesulfonates/economics', 'Capecitabine', 'Dasatinib', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/economics', 'Drug Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Employer Health Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Fluorouracil/analogs & derivatives/economics', 'Gefitinib', 'Health Benefit Plans, Employee/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Indoles/economics', 'Insurance, Pharmaceutical Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Lenalidomide', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/economics', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/economics', 'Prescription Fees/statistics & numerical data', 'Pyridines/economics', 'Pyrimidines/economics', 'Pyrroles/economics', 'Quinazolines/economics', 'Sorafenib', 'Sunitinib', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/economics', 'Thiazoles/economics', 'United States']",2006/09/20 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/09/20 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2006(12)7: 570-577 [pii]', '10.18553/jmcp.2006.12.7.570 [doi]']",ppublish,J Manag Care Pharm. 2006 Sep;12(7):570-7. doi: 10.18553/jmcp.2006.12.7.570.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a kinetic analysis of T cell responses during FV infection to determine when dysfunction of CD8+ T cells and suppressive activity of CD4+ regulatory T cells develops. At 1 week post infection, virus-specific CD8+ T cells with effector phenotype and cytolytic potential expanded. Peak expansion was found at 12 days post infection, correlating with peak viral loads. After 2 weeks when viral loads dropped, numbers of activated CD8+ T cells started to decline. However, a population of virus-specific CD8+ T cells with effector phenotype was still detectable subsequently, but these cells had lost their ability to produce granzymes and to degranulate cytotoxic molecules. Contemporaneous with the development of CD8+ T cell dysfunction, different CD4+ T cell populations expressing cell surface markers for Treg and the Treg-associated transcription factor Foxp3 expanded. Transfer as well as depletion experiments indicated that regulatory CD4+ cells developed during the second week of FV infection and subsequently suppressed CD8+ T cell functions, which was associated with impaired virus clearance.","['Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Kraft, Anke R M', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Arndt, Tanja', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Zelinskyy G', 'Kraft AR', 'Schimmer S', 'Arndt T', 'Dittmer U']","['Institut fuer Virologie des Universitaetsklinikums Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",2006/09/19 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200636059 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2006 Oct;36(10):2658-70. doi: 10.1002/eji.200636059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which the MLL PTD contributes to aberrant hematopoiesis and/or leukemia is unknown. To examine this, we generated a mouse knockin model in which exons 5 through 11 of the murine Mll gene were targeted to intron 4 of the endogenous Mll locus. Mll(PTD/WT) mice exhibit an alteration in the boundaries of normal homeobox (Hox) gene expression during embryogenesis, resulting in axial skeletal defects and increased numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Mll(PTD/WT) mice overexpress Hoxa7, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10 in spleen, BM, and blood. An increase in histone H3/H4 acetylation and histone H3 lysine 4 (Lys4) methylation within the Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 promoters provides an epigenetic mechanism by which this overexpression occurs in vivo and an etiologic role for MLL PTD gain of function in the genesis of AML.","['Dorrance, Adrienne M', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Yuan, Weifeng', 'Becknell, Brian', 'Arnoczky, Kristy J', 'Guimond, Martin', 'Strout, Matthew P', 'Feng, Lan', 'Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Yu, Li', 'Rush, Laura J', 'Weinstein, Michael', 'Leone, Gustavo', 'Wu, Lizhao', 'Ferketich, Amy', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Dorrance AM', 'Liu S', 'Yuan W', 'Becknell B', 'Arnoczky KJ', 'Guimond M', 'Strout MP', 'Feng L', 'Nakamura T', 'Yu L', 'Rush LJ', 'Weinstein M', 'Leone G', 'Wu L', 'Ferketich A', 'Whitman SP', 'Marcucci G', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43220, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Ribs/abnormalities/metabolism', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics']",2006/09/19 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2005/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI25546 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2006 Oct;116(10):2707-16. doi: 10.1172/JCI25546.

The median follow-up was 27 months. Until day +100, no transplant-related mortality was recorded. The incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was 55 and 75%, respectively. Two patients (10%) died from GvHD. Fourteen (70%) patients achieved molecular remission. Additional post-transplant intervention (donor lymphocyte infusion, imatinib) was necessary, however, in 10 patients (50% of the patients; non-achievement of stable molecular remission or later relapses). The total direct cost of the transplantation treatment for all of the patients came to 1,572,880 euro.

A total of more than 100 invited participants (scientists and clinicians working in the area of allogeneic stem cell transplantation) discussed research in the area of lymphoid malignancies. Major topics of the 2006 meeting were lymphocyte biology, experimental systems, lymphoma pathogenesis, cellular therapy in vivo and vitro, idiotype-specific responses and graft-versus-malignancy reactions for lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Further highlights were immune responses to blasts of ALL, haploidentical transplantation, role of natural killer cells, clinical guidelines for allogeneic transplantation and adoptive immunotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, new antibody-mediated strategies. As can be seen in the summaries of the individual presentations, progress was made in the understanding of lymphoma biology and in the clinical application of graft-versus-lymphoma or graft-versus-myeloma effects. Each day was followed by round-table discussions, which summarized new data and challenged established concepts. The discussions resulted in new insights and projects for basic research and clinical transplantation.","['Munker, R', 'Reibke, R', 'Kolb, H J']","['Munker R', 'Reibke R', 'Kolb HJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA. rmunke@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Animals', 'Germany', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/09/19 09:00,2006/12/12 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705499 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705499 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Nov;38(9):593-607. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705499.

The literature is lacking in reports that specifically address the safety, reliability, and management techniques related to performing microvascular surgery in this group of patients. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients with hematological disorders who received free flaps from 1995 to 2004 was performed. All patients had a hematologic work-up that confirmed the stability of the underlying disease. There were three male and three female patients with an average age of 27.6 years (range,12 to 63 years). Patients had leukemia (n = 2), hereditary spherocytosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and hemophilia (n = 2). Their defects were in the areas of the nasocolumella/upper lip, palate, palate and midface, and lower extremities. RESULTS: All patients received free flaps and all but one had an uneventful postoperative course. That patient, with hemophilia, 1 day after factor replacement was halted, had bleeding that required surgical re-exploration along with aggressive hematologic management. All flaps survived without vascular compromise. No wound infections were observed. All donor sites healed without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Essential ingredients in the treatment plan of patients with hematologic disorders undergoing free flaps include familiarity with the preoperative medical condition and potential postoperative complications, close monitoring of the patients and their medical condition before and after surgery, meticulous surgical technique, and close cooperation with the hematologists and infectious disease specialists. By following this regimen, patients with hematologic disorders and an otherwise stable medical history can undergo free tissue transfer safely and effectively with reliable outcomes.","['Ozkan, Omer', 'Chen, Hung-Chi', 'Mardini, Samir', 'Cigna, Emanuele', 'Hao, Sheng-Po', 'Hung, Kai-Feng', 'Chen, Hern-Shin']","['Ozkan O', 'Chen HC', 'Mardini S', 'Cigna E', 'Hao SP', 'Hung KF', 'Chen HS']","['Antalya, Turkey; and Taipei and Kaohsiung County, Taiwan From the Departments of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, E-Da Hospital/ I-Shou University, Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital and Medical College, Chang-Gung University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Plast Reconstr Surg,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,1306050,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microsurgery', 'Middle Aged', '*Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Surgical Flaps', 'Wounds and Injuries/complications/*surgery']",2006/09/19 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.prs.0000232371.69606.61 [doi]', '00006534-200609150-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2006 Sep 15;118(4):936-944. doi: 10.1097/01.prs.0000232371.69606.61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1097/01.prs.0000232371.69606.61 [doi],,,

Elevations in micronucleus formation were observed following treatment with 10(-12) to 10(-9) M PBDE concentrations despite the fact that less than one-fourth of the concentration of each test agent administered partitioned out of the media and into the incubating cells. However, low-dose treatment levels remained within the range of reported concentrations measured in UK serum samples collected in 2003. Clonogenic survival and gene expression was unaltered following 10(-12) to 10(-9) M PBDE treatment but significant (P < 0.05) elevations in growth kinetics were observed. Significant alterations in IR cell spectra were associated with treatments, and plotted clusters following principal component analysis highlighted these changes.

Little is known about the etiology of this heterogeneous group of diseases despite the fact they constitute the major cause of death by disease among this population. Because of its relatively high prevalence, most of the work done in pediatric oncogenetics has been focused on leukemias, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although it is now well accepted that genetic variations play a significant role in determining individual's cancer susceptibility, few studies have explored genetic susceptibility to childhood leukemia with respect to common polymorphisms. The biochemical and genetic mechanisms contributing to cancer susceptibility are numerous and can be grouped into broad categories: 1) cellular growth and differentiation, 2) DNA replication and repair, 3) metabolism of carcinogens, 4) apoptosis, 5) oxidative stress response and 6) cell cycle. To evaluate whether candidate genes in these pathways are involved in childhood leukemogenesis, we conducted association studies. We showed that leukemogenesis in children may be associated with DNA variants in some of these genes and that the combination of genotypes seems to be more predictive of risk then either of them independently. We also observed that, at least at some loci, the parental genetics might be important in predicting the risk of cancer in this pediatric model of a complex disease. Taken together, these results indicate that the investigation of a single enzyme and/or a single genotype might not be sufficient to explain the etiology of childhood leukemia because of the complexity of the environment and that of the inter-individual variability in cancer susceptibility.","['Sinnett, Daniel', ""N'Diaye, Nina"", 'Labuda, Damian', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Sinnett D', ""N'Diaye N"", 'Labuda D', 'Krajinovic M']","[""Service d'hematologie-oncologie, Centre de cancerologie Charles-Bruneau, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Departement de pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, 3175 Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, Quebec, H3T 1C5 Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'Child', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Paternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2006/09/19 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2006 Sep;93(9):857-65.,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,Les determinants genetiques de la leucemie de l'enfant.,,,,

We investigated histone H2A-immunoreactive proteins in acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells using three polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to distinct regions of H2A. Two unknown immunoreactive proteins (9- and 12-kDa proteins), H2A (14kDa) and ubiquitinated H2A (23kDa) were found in the cell lysates prepared by immediate direct addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the cells as well as in the nuclear and chromatin fractions. However, they were not found in the cytoplasmic fraction. The unknown proteins were successfully purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from the cell nucleus extract and identified as 9-kDa H2A(1-87) and 12-kDa H2A(1-114), suggesting that both were produced by limited proteolysis of intact H2A(1-129). The truncated forms of H2A probably persisted as chromatin constituents, since the stability of H2A(1-87) in the chromatin fraction was sensitive to treatment with micrococcal nuclease, and H2A(1-114) was solubilized with lower ionic strength from the chromatin fraction obtained by micrococcal nuclease treatment. Truncated H2A proteins in THP-1 cells were transiently increased in amount by short-term treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or all-trans-retinoic acid, both of which induce macrophage-like differentiation. Furthermore, these increases were suppressed by preceding treatment with carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG132) but not with carbobenzoxy-l-isoleucyl-gamma-t-butyl-l-glutamyl-l-alanyl-l-leucinal (PSI), both of which are generally known as proteasome inhibitors. Our results suggest that histone H2A is cleaved at least at two sites by protease(s) that remain obscure, and might affect chromatins in the early stage of THP-1 cell differentiation.","['Minami, Jiro', 'Takada, Koji', 'Aoki, Katsuhiko', 'Shimada, Yohta', 'Okawa, Yutaka', 'Usui, Noriko', 'Ohkawa, Kiyoshi']","['Minami J', 'Takada K', 'Aoki K', 'Shimada Y', 'Okawa Y', 'Usui N', 'Ohkawa K']","['Department of Biochemistry 1, Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8, Nishishinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (chromatin conjugate protein A24)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*chemistry/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Histones/biosynthesis/*chemistry/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins', 'Monocytes/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitins/biosynthesis/*chemistry/immunology/*isolation & purification']",2006/09/19 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(06)00230-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2007;39(1):171-80. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.010.

Neither terminal apoptosis (low counts of TUNEL-positive cells) nor necrosis (moderate counts of propidium iodide-positive cells) occurred. Importantly, SB attenuated protein expression of CML-related chimeric kinase BCR-ABL that is responsible for the deregulated proliferation of CML cells. The proteomic analysis (2-D electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and/or Western blotting) revealed several proteins that were differentially expressed or their mobility was altered due to butyrate treatment, namely, HSP90, HSP70, p23, cyclophilin A (CYPA), prefoldin2 (PFD2) and alpha-, gamma-, epsilon-human globin chains.

Lysophospholipids and their receptors have also been implicated in cell differentiation. A potential role of SPC in stem cell or tumour cell differentiation has been elusive so far. Here we examined the effect of SPC on the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and of human NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells, a well established tumour differentiation model. Our data show that mouse embryonic stem cells and NB4 cells express the relevant GPCRs for SPC. We demonstrate both at the level of morphology and of gene expression that SPC induces neuronal and cardiac differentiation of mouse ES cells. Furthermore, SPC induces differentiation of NB4 cells by a mechanism which is critically dependent on the activity of the MEK-ERK cascade.

Thus any case of severe neutropenia occurring in a patient receiving olanzapine is alarming to clinicians. First, a review of the literature produced 41 anecdotic cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis during treatment with olanzapine (Zyprexa) reported in a total of 24 publications. Second, we report a case of neutropenia, which proved to be fatal in a schizophrenia patient receiving olanzapine and thiazide. The cause of the death was Myelodysplastic syndrome.

Bone marrow cytogenetic study confirmed the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11, as reported in myeloid leukemia. If this patient would have died suddenly without the laboratory investigations that lead to the diagnosis of myeloblastic leukemia, the cause would have been probably and wrongfully allotted to treatment with olanzapine.","['Stip, Emmanuel', 'Langlois, Robert', 'Thuot, Claude', 'Mancini-Marie, Adham']","['Stip E', 'Langlois R', 'Thuot C', 'Mancini-Marie A']","['Department of Medicine and Psychiatry, Hopital Louis-H.

BML-210 (N-(2-Aminophenyl)-N' phenyloctanol diamine) is the novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, and its mechanism of action has not been characterized. In this study, we examined the in vitro effects of BML-210 on the human leukemia cell lines (NB4, HL-60, THP-1, and K562). We found that BML-210 inhibits the growth of all cell lines and promotes apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. BML-210 alone induces HL-60 and K562 cell differentiation (up to 30%) to granulocytes and erythrocytes, respectively, and in combination with differentiation agents - all-trans retinoic acid and hemin, markedly potentates it. Those treatments cause G1 arrest and histone H4 acetylation, affects transcription factor NF-kappaB and Sp1 binding activity to their consensus sequences, the p21 or the FasL promoters, and influences expression of Sp1, NF-kappaB, p21 and FasL. These findings suggest that BML-210 could be a promising antileukemic agent to induce apoptosis and to modulate differentiation through the modulation of histone acetylation and gene expression.","['Savickiene, Jurate', 'Borutinskaite, Veronika-Viktorija', 'Treigyte, Grazina', 'Magnusson, Karl-Eric', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta']","['Savickiene J', 'Borutinskaite VV', 'Treigyte G', 'Magnusson KE', 'Navakauskiene R']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, LT-08662 Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Anilides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (N1-(2-aminophenyl)-N8-phenyloctanediamide)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Anilides/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2006/09/19 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(06)00833-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2006 Nov 7;549(1-3):9-18. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.08.010.

The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Expression of Fas ligand and apoptotic proteins is found in leprosy lesions and M. leprae has been shown to activate pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 genes, Bak and Bax. However, the mechanism by which M. leprae modulates apoptosis is as yet unclear. We investigated expression of apoptotic genes in THP-1 monocytes in response to infection by M. leprae and non-pathogenic M. bovis BCG. RESULTS: M. leprae did not induce apoptosis in THP-1 cells, while BCG induced a significant loss of cell viability by 18 h post-infection at both (multiplicity of infection) MOI-10 and 20, with an increase by 48 h. BCG-induced cell death was accompanied by characteristic apoptotic DNA laddering in cells. Non-viable BCG had a limited effect on host cell death suggesting that BCG-induced apoptosis was a function of mycobacterial viability. M. leprae also activated lower levels of TNF-alpha secretion and TNF-alpha mRNA expression than BCG. Mycobacterium-induced activation of apoptotic gene expression was determined over a time course of infection. M. leprae reduced Bad and Bak mRNA expression by 18 h post-stimulation, with a further decrease at 48 h. Outcome of cell viability is determined by the ratio between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins present in the cell. M. leprae infection resulted in downregulation of gene expression ratios, Bad/Bcl-2 mRNA by 39% and Bak/Bcl-2 mRNA by 23%. In contrast, live BCG increased Bad/Bcl-2 mRNA (29 %) but had a negligible effect on Bak/Bcl-2 mRNA. Heat killed BCG induced only a negligible (1-4 %) change in mRNA expression of either Bak/Bcl-2 or Bad/Bcl-2. Additionally, M. leprae upregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic gene Mcl-1 while, BCG downregulated Mcl-1 mRNA. CONCLUSION: This study proposes an association between mycobacterium-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells and the regulation of Bcl-2 family of proteins. M. leprae restricts apoptosis in THP-1 cells by downregulation of Bad and Bak and upregulation of Mcl-1 mRNA expression.","['Hasan, Zahra', 'Ashraf, Mussarat', 'Tayyebi, Ali', 'Hussain, Rabia']","['Hasan Z', 'Ashraf M', 'Tayyebi A', 'Hussain R']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, The Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. zahra.hasan@aku.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Microbiol,BMC microbiology,100966981,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Mycobacterium bovis/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Mycobacterium leprae/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Virulence', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*genetics', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/*genetics']",2006/09/19 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2180-6-78 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2180-6-78 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Microbiol. 2006 Sep 18;6:78. doi: 10.1186/1471-2180-6-78.,20060918,,,PMC1592106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because both components are translated in different intracellular compartments, elucidating the mechanisms of retrovirus assembly thus requires the study of their intracellular trafficking. RESULTS: We used a CD25 (Tac) chimera-based approach to study the trafficking of Moloney murine leukemia virus and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus Env proteins. We found that the cytoplasmic tails (CTs) of both Env conserved two major signals that control a complex intracellular trafficking. A dileucine-based motif controls the sorting of the chimeras from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) toward endosomal compartments. Env proteins then follow a retrograde transport to the TGN due to the action of a tyrosine-based motif. Mutation of either motif induces the mis-localization of the chimeric proteins and both motifs are found to mediate interactions of the viral CTs with clathrin adaptors. CONCLUSION: This data reveals the unexpected complexity of the intracellular trafficking of retrovirus Env proteins that cycle between the TGN and endosomes. Given that Gag proteins hijack endosomal host proteins, our work suggests that the endosomal pathway may be used by retroviruses to ensure proper encountering of viral structural Gag and Env proteins in cells, an essential step of virus assembly.","['Blot, Vincent', 'Lopez-Verges, Sandra', 'Breton, Marie', 'Pique, Claudine', 'Berlioz-Torrent, Clarisse', 'Grange, Marie-Pierre']","['Blot V', 'Lopez-Verges S', 'Breton M', 'Pique C', 'Berlioz-Torrent C', 'Grange MP']","['Institut Cochin, Departement Biologie Cellulaire, Paris, F-75014 France.

This period covers successively an initial period during the induction treatment and a consolidation period during the postinduction treatment. From 1994 to 2002, 922 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (excluding French-American-British L3 subtype) were enrolled in a multicentre protocol and followed, with a mean follow up of 58 months. A multivariate time-segmented analysis was performed on 658 patients. Analyses of the initial (before 100 d) and the late phases were realised after stratification on the type of induction treatment and on the different treatment strategies respectively. Age was the sole factor that influenced survival during the initial phase (hazard ratio 1.48 per 10-yr increase; P < 0.01). Factors that predicted survival during the late phase were age (hazard ratio 1.12, P = 0.02), white blood cells count (hazard ratio 1.01 per 10(10) cells/L increase; P < 0.05), lactic dehydrogenase level (hazard ratio 1.001 for 10 IU/L increase; P < 0.01) and t(9;22) karyotype or miscellaneous others vs. normal karyotype (hazard ratios 1.40; P < 0.01 and 1.06; P = 0.04 respectively).

In the present study we evaluated the serum levels of soluble Ang-2 (sAng-2) and soluble Tie-2 (sTie-2) in patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements were carried out in 15 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 25 with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 24 with multiple myeloma (MM) and six with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). In addition, we correlated the levels of angiopoietins with known prognostic factors. sAng-2 and sTie-2 were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In patients with CML and MM the levels of sAng-2 were significantly higher (1686.53 +/- 936.41 pg/mL and 1917.82 +/- 1427 pg/mL, respectively) than in controls (n = 15; 996.096 +/- 414.65 pg/mL) (P < 0.01). In patients with MM sAng-2 levels were significantly increased with increasing stage of disease, from stage I to stage III (P < 0.03) and presented a trend of correlation with Beta2-microglobulin levels (r = 0.317) and grade of bone involvement. Furthermore, the levels of sAng-2 determined after 6 months of chemotherapy in CML patients were significantly lower than at diagnosis in the patients who achieved haematological remission. Circulating sTie-2 levels were increased in patients with ET (17.5 +/- 9.2 vs 9 +/- 3.5 ng/mL; P < 0.01) and in those with CML (16.29 +/- 8.7 ng/mL; P < 0.04). In conclusion, abnormal levels of sAng-2 and sTie-2 are present in some haematological malignancies. These markers may play a role in the pathophysiology of these conditions and their progression.","['Quartarone, E', 'Alonci, A', 'Allegra, A', 'Bellomo, G', 'Calabro, L', ""D'Angelo, A"", 'Del Fabro, V', 'Grasso, A', 'Cincotta, M', 'Musolino, C']","['Quartarone E', 'Alonci A', 'Allegra A', 'Bellomo G', 'Calabro L', ""D'Angelo A"", 'Del Fabro V', 'Grasso A', 'Cincotta M', 'Musolino C']","['Division of Haematology, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Angiopoietin-2/*blood/*physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Paraproteinemias/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, TIE-2/*blood/*physiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/metabolism']",2006/09/19 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH756 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0902-4441.2006.t01-1-EJH2795.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Dec;77(6):480-5. doi: 10.1111/j.0902-4441.2006.t01-1-EJH2795.x.

Hypermethylation of SOCS1 gene, resulting in transcriptional silencing, is suggested to play an important role in cancer development. We sought to characterise SOCS1 methylation in primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and clarify its clinical implications. The methylation status of SOCS1 was analysed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 114 patients with primary MDS and serial studies were performed in 29 of them. SOCS1 methylation occurred in 54 patients (47.4%), and was more frequent in patients with high-risk MDS than in those with low-risk (52.6% vs. 25.8%, P = 0.011). SOCS1 methylation was closely associated with NRAS mutation (P = 0.010) and inversely associated with good-risk karyotype (P = 0.021). With a median follow-up of 17 months (range: 1-231 months), two patients acquired SOCS1 methylation during disease progression. In two patients, SOCS1 methylation present at diagnosis, disappeared after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients with SOCS1 methylation had a higher cumulative risk of leukaemic transformation than those without (55.8% vs. 27.7% at 3 years, P = 0.004). This difference remained significant within the subgroup of patients with high-risk MDS (67.3% vs. 45.1% at 3 years, P = 0.045). This is the first report to demonstrate the clinical relevance of SOCS1 methylation in MDS. It may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MDS, especially among patients with high-risk subtypes.","['Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Yao, Ming', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Ko, Bo-Sheng', 'Huang, Shen-Yi', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Shen, Ming-Ching', 'Wang, Chiu-Hwa', 'Yeh, Yo-Chia', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Wu SJ', 'Yao M', 'Chou WC', 'Tang JL', 'Chen CY', 'Ko BS', 'Huang SY', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Shen MC', 'Wang CH', 'Yeh YC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Far-East Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/09/19 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2006/09/19 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6293 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06293.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Nov;135(3):317-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06293.x.

In erythroid progenitors, the integration of spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) into the PU.1 locus causes its overexpression, which blocks their terminal differentiation into erythrocytes and ultimately leads to the development of erythroleukemia. However, in myeloid lineages, PU.1 promotes granulocytic and monocytic differentiation, and graded reduction in its expression blocks their differentiation or maturation and thereby causes myelogenous leukemia. Thus, in addition to normal hematopoietic regulation, PU.1 plays a significant role in leukemogenesis.

A randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of early versus late epoetin alfa in this population was conducted, focusing on quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma and baseline hemoglobin of 10 to 12 g/dL who were scheduled for > or = 4 months of myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive < or = 16 weeks of epoetin alfa at a dose of 40,000 U once weekly immediately (early) or to wait and only receive epoetin alfa if hemoglobin decreased to < 9 g/dL (late). Those patients with a hemoglobin level > 12 g/dL after 3 chemotherapy cycles were not randomized. The primary endpoint was a mean change in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) total. RESULTS: In all, 269 patients with a hemoglobin level < or = 12 g/dL were randomized. The mean total FACT-An increased 3.84 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.21-7.46) in early patients and decreased 4.37 (95% CI, -7.99 to -0.74) in late patients (P = .003).

For patients with acute leukemia or those who undergo bone marrow transplantation, prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones diminished the risk of death from any cause by 33% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2-54%). Thus, 55 patients who have acute leukemia or who undergo bone marrow transplantation must receive prophylaxis to prevent 1 death. In 4 studies that included patients with solid tumors or lymphoma, prophylaxis reduced the rate of death during the first month (relative risk, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27-0.97), and 82 patients had to receive prophylaxis to prevent 1 death. The main argument brought against prophylaxis is the induction of resistance. Patients who received prophylaxis did not experience more infections caused by resistant strains than patients in the control group. The recent GIMEMA study was conducted in a population with a nearly 50% resistance to fluoroquinolones in all pathogens and 20% resistance in gram-negative isolates, thus indicating that prophylaxis should be offered in settings with similar or less resistance. Prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones was efficacious in reducing infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.

Colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assays have historically been used for the enumeration of MSCs. However, the need to isolate and further analyze MSCs requires new strategies based on cell surface markers. The purpose of this work was to verify the phenotype of BM MSCs in vivo and to develop flow cytometry-based methods for their evaluation. METHODS: Pre-enrichment with D7-FIB-conjugated microbeads, cell sorting for CD45low D7-FIB+ LNGFR+ cells, and CFU-F assay were used to confirm the phenotype of BM MSCs in vivo. Further phenotypic characterization of MSCs was performed using three-color flow cytometry following pre-enrichment or by direct four-color flow cytometry. The sensitivity of direct flow cytometry/rare event analysis for the accurate enumeration of MSCs was validated using 85 samples from patients with neoplastic BM diseases. RESULTS: In normal BM, a significant correlation was found between the frequencies of CFU-Fs and CD45low D7-FIB+ LNGFR+ cells (n = 19, R = 0.719, P = 0.001). Following cell sorting, 15% of these cells were clonogenic. The same cells were enriched using LNGFR-based positive selection, CD45/Glycophorin A-based depletion, or plastic adherence. CD45low D7-FIB+ LNGFR+ cells expressed classic makers of cultured MSCs CD73/SH3 and CD105/SH2 and markers of stromal reticular cells CD106/VCAM and alkaline phosphatase. Novel markers were identified including leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and gp130. CD45low D7-FIB+ LNGFR+ cells were increased fourfold in the floating fat fraction of normal BM aspirates. Their frequency was decreased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (threefold, n = 13, P = 0.049) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (ninefold, n = 11, P = 0.001) compared with that in age-matched controls (n = 26 and n = 31, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the usefulness of flow cytometry-based methods for the detection, enumeration and further phenotypic analysis of BM MSCs. These findings have broad applications for the future evaluation of BM MSCs in health and disease.","['Jones, Elena A', 'English, Anne', 'Kinsey, Sally E', 'Straszynski, Liz', 'Emery, Paul', 'Ponchel, Frederique', 'McGonagle, Dennis']","['Jones EA', 'English A', 'Kinsey SE', 'Straszynski L', 'Emery P', 'Ponchel F', 'McGonagle D']","['Academic Unit of Musculoskeletal Disease, Leeds Institute for Molecular Medicine,University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom. msjej@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

This population may be suitable for the adoptive immunotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Little is known however, about the frequency and function of circulating gammadelta T cells in AML. The aim of the study was to enumerate peripheral blood gammadelta T cells in patients with AML and explore the feasibility of their use clinically. METHODS: We compared the absolute circulating gammadelta T cell levels in 33 AML patients before and after treatment versus 20 healthy volunteers using flow cytometry. The function of gammadelta T cells was assessed by detection of intracelluar interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and cytotoxicity against leukemic blasts. RESULTS: AML patients with high blast counts prior to induction chemotherapy had marginally decreased gammadelta T cell levels compared with healthy controls: median 38/microL versus 83/microL; P = 0.051. Sequential gammadelta T cell enumeration after induction showed significantly decreased counts in patients with a persistently high blast burden compared to patients with reduced but detectable residual disease (molecular maker or borderline bone marrow infiltration): median 7/microL versus 105/microL; P = 0.008. Patients with residual disease had significantly higher gammadelta T cell counts compared to those retested after they had achieved complete remission (CR); P = 0.0025. In CR, gammadelta T cell counts remained lower than those of healthy individuals: median 33/microL versus 83/microL, P = 0.030. We detected a sharp increase (on average, four-fold higher than values in CR) of gammadelta T cells in patients in very early morphologic or molecular relapse. We also tested the functional properties of gammadelta T cells from patients with AML in CR. Flow cytometric assessment of IFN-gamma revealed similar numbers of gammadelta T cells expressing the T1 cytokine compared with healthy controls. We also showed that gammadelta T cells were able to kill leukemic target cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: Flow cytometric assessment of gammadelta T cells in patients with AML revealed quantitative shifts with respect to disease status. Our data suggest that gammadelta T cells warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic agents.","['Aswald, Jorg M', 'Wang, Xing-Hua', 'Aswald, Sandra', 'Lutynski, Andrzej', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Keating, Armand']","['Aswald JM', 'Wang XH', 'Aswald S', 'Lutynski A', 'Minden MD', 'Messner HA', 'Keating A']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital/Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2M9.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

A systematically conducted evaluation of previous studies and data from our own material reveals a strikingly expressed heterogeneity of findings. Assessment of MF should be performed by a recently established semiquantitative scoring system regarding quantity and quality (reticulin versus collagen). It is important to differentiate between a fiber increase in bone marrow specimens and the clinical diagnosis that is explicitly based on extramedullary hematopoiesis (myeloid metaplasia). For this reason, prodromal stages of (reticulin) fibrosis are overlooked by the clinicians. Up to 30% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia show a minimal to advanced MF that is significantly associated not only with corresponding clinical parameters but more importantly with prognosis. In polycythemia vera about 20% of patients may display some degree of reticulin fibrosis at diagnosis, depending on stage of the disease. Transformation into (collagen) MF after more than 10 years is accompanied by clinical signs of myeloid metaplasia (spent phase). Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is characterised by the absence of increased reticulin at onset and an insignificant progression into MF, provided diagnosis is performed by the WHO criteria. Discrimination of prefibrotic and early stages of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) from ET is relevant, especially concerning the rate and time usually required for the development of MF with myeloid metaplasia (full-blown CIMF). In conclusion, more elaborate evaluations including standardized grading of MF is warranted by regarding bone marrow biopsy specimens in association with clinical parameters including follow-up examinations.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Examination', 'Chronic Disease', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/mortality']",2006/09/16 09:00,2006/10/19 09:00,['2006/09/16 09:00'],"['2006/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-21.1367 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2006 Dec;21(12):1367-78. doi: 10.14670/HH-21.1367.,,,,,129,,,,,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-21.1367 [doi],,,

We identified 343 infections among patients with underlying hematologic malignancies and HSCT. We collected data on type of disease, age, sex, type of infection, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, therapy, and outcome. Influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus accounted for most cases and were approximately equal in frequency. Most infections occurred predominantly among recipients of allogeneic transplants. Infection progressed to pneumonia in 119 patients (35%) and occurred with similar frequency for the 3 viruses.

CLL cells also express 2 other receptors for BAFF, namely B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand-interactor (TACI), which also bind a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). We found that signaling through BR3, but not BCMA or TACI, activated the alternative nuclear factor of kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway in CLL cells, whereas signaling through BCMA/TACI induced activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. Blocking BR3 did not inhibit the capacity of BAFF to support CLL cell survival in vitro. On the other hand, specifically blocking the canonical NF-kappaB pathway with UTC, an inhibitor of IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), or transfection of CLL cells with the IkappaBalpha super-repressor, blocked the capacity of BAFF and APRIL to promote CLL cell survival in vitro. This contrasts what is found with normal blood B cells, which apparently depend on activation of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway for BAFF-enhanced survival. These findings suggest that inhibitors of protein kinase IKKbeta, which is required for activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, might have a therapeutic role in this disease.","['Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Nishio, Mitsufumi', 'Enzler, Thomas', 'Cottam, Howard B', 'Fukuda, Tetsuya', 'James, Danelle F', 'Karin, Michael', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Endo T', 'Nishio M', 'Enzler T', 'Cottam HB', 'Fukuda T', 'James DF', 'Karin M', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center and Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0820, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-ureido-thiophene-3 carboxylic acid amide)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)']",IM,"['B-Cell Activating Factor/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Carboxylic Acids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Thiophenes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/biosynthesis/*physiology']",2006/09/16 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2006/09/16 09:00'],"['2006/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52082-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-027755 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 15;109(2):703-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-027755.

The fusion inhibition of many retroviruses, except murine leukemia virus (MLV), with peptides corresponding to interacting regions in the hairpin supports the model. MLV fusion is controlled by isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide in Env. We show here that TM peptides bind to MLV Env that has been arrested at an intermediate stage of activation by alkylation of the isomerization-active thiol in the surface subunit. This inhibits fusion rescue by dithiothreitol-mediated reduction of the surface protein-TM disulfide.","['Wallin, Michael', 'Ekstrom, Maria', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Wallin M', 'Ekstrom M', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism']",2006/09/16 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/09/16 09:00'],"['2006/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/19/9921 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00380-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Oct;80(19):9921-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00380-06.,,,,PMC1617267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TRIM5 proteins act early after virion entry and prevent viral reverse transcription products from accumulating. We recently found that proteasome inhibitors altered the rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha restriction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), allowing reverse transcription products to accumulate even though viral infection remained blocked. To assess whether sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors was a common feature of primate TRIM5 proteins, we conducted a similar analysis of restriction mediated by owl monkey TRIM-cyclophilin A (CypA) or human TRIM5alpha. Similar to rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha restriction, proteasome inhibition prevented owl monkey TRIM-CypA restriction of HIV-1 reverse transcription, even though HIV-1 infection and the output of 2-LTR circles remained impaired. Likewise, proteasome inhibition alleviated human TRIM5alpha restriction of N-tropic murine leukemia virus reverse transcription. Finally, HIV-1 reverse transcription products escaping rhesus TRIM5alpha restriction by proteasome inhibition were fully competent for integration in vitro, demonstrating that TRIM5alpha likely prevents the viral cDNA from accessing chromosomal target DNA. Collectively, these data indicate that the diverse TRIM5 proteins inhibit retroviral infection in multiple ways and that inhibition of reverse transcription products is not necessary for TRIM5-mediated restriction of retroviral infection.","['Anderson, Jenny L', 'Campbell, Edward M', 'Wu, Xiaolu', 'Vandegraaff, Nick', 'Engelman, Alan', 'Hope, Thomas J']","['Anderson JL', 'Campbell EM', 'Wu X', 'Vandegraaff N', 'Engelman A', 'Hope TJ']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Ward 8-140, 303 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HIV-1/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2006/09/16 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/09/16 09:00'],"['2006/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/19/9754 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01052-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Oct;80(19):9754-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01052-06.,,,"['R01 AI047770/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052014/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI4770/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI52014/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1617233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed in vivo lymphocyte trafficking in bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected sheep.

We hypothesize that this high frequency of genetic recombination is a common feature of primate lentiviruses. Alternatively, it is possible that HIV-1 is unique among primate lentiviruses in possessing high recombination rates. Among other primate lentiviruses, only the molecular mechanisms of HIV-2 replication have been extensively studied. There are reported differences between the replication mechanisms of HIV-1 and those of HIV-2, such as preferences for RNA packaging in cis and properties of reverse transcriptase and RNase H activities. These biological disparities could lead to differences in recombination rates between the two viruses. Currently, HIV-1 is the only primate lentivirus in which recombination rates have been measured. To test our hypothesis, we established recombination systems to measure the recombination rates of two other primate lentiviruses, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys (SIVagm), in one round of viral replication. We determined that, for markers separated by 588, 288, and 90 bp, HIV-2 recombined at rates of 7.4%, 5.5%, and 2.4%, respectively, whereas SIVagm recombined at rates of 7.8%, 5.6%, and 2.7%, respectively. These high recombination rates are within the same range as the previously measured HIV-1 recombination rates. Taken together, our results indicate that HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVagm all possess high recombination frequencies; hence, the high recombination potential is most likely a common feature of primate lentivirus replication.","['Chen, Jianbo', 'Powell, Douglas', 'Hu, Wei-Shau']","['Chen J', 'Powell D', 'Hu WS']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, NCI-Frederick, P.O.

Mutations within the M-MuLV proviral vectors were Tn7 based and resulted in 15-bp insertions. Mutations within an HIV-1 IN bacterial expression vector were based on Tn5 and resulted in 57-bp insertions. The effects of the insertions were examined in vivo (M-MuLV) and in vitro (HIV-1). A total of 178 individual M-MuLV constructs were analyzed; 40 in-frame insertions within RT connection-RNase H, 108 in-frame insertions within IN, 13 insertions encoding stop codons within RNase H, and 17 insertions encoding stop codons within IN. For HIV-1 IN, 56 mutants were analyzed. In both M-MuLV and HIV-1 IN, regions are identified which functionally tolerate multiple-linker insertions. For MuLV, these correspond to the RT-IN proteolytic junction, the junction between the IN core and C terminus, and the C terminus of IN. For HIV-1 IN, in addition to the junction between the IN core and C terminus and the C terminus of IN, insertions between the N terminus and core domains maintained integration and disintegration activity. Of the 40 in-frame insertions within the M-MuLV RT connection-RNase H domains, only the three C-terminal insertions mapping to the RT-IN proteolytic junction were viable. These results correlate with deletion studies mapping the domain and subdomain boundaries of RT and IN. Importantly, these genetic footprints provide a means to identify nonessential regions within RT and IN for targeted gene therapy applications.","['Puglia, Jennifer', 'Wang, Tan', 'Smith-Snyder, Christine', 'Cote, Marie', 'Scher, Michael', 'Pelletier, Joelle N', 'John, Sinu', 'Jonsson, Colleen B', 'Roth, Monica J']","['Puglia J', 'Wang T', 'Smith-Snyder C', 'Cote M', 'Scher M', 'Pelletier JN', 'John S', 'Jonsson CB', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Gene Expression', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/genetics', 'Integrases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism']",2006/09/16 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/09/16 09:00'],"['2006/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/19/9497 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00856-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Oct;80(19):9497-510. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00856-06.,,,"['S06 GM008136-280035/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S06 GM008136-270035/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S06 GM008136-260035/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S06 GM008136/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T34 GM007666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM070837/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07666-24/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1617218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such findings have led to suggestions that infection could play a role in the causation of this disease. An earlier New Zealand study found a protective effect of parental marriage on the risk of childhood ALL, and studies elsewhere have reported increased risks in relation to older parental ages. This study aimed to assess whether lower parity, lower social class, unmarried status and older parental ages increase the risk of childhood ALL (primarily). These variables were also assessed in relation to the risks of childhood acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease. METHODS: A case control study was conducted. The cases were 585 children diagnosed with leukaemias or lymphomas throughout New Zealand over a 12 year period. The 585 age and sex matched controls were selected at random from birth records. Birth records from cases (via cancer registration record linkage) and from controls provided accurate data on maternal parity, social class derived from paternal occupation, maternal marital status, ages of both parents, and urban status based on the address on the birth certificate. Analysis was by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant associations overall between childhood ALL and parity of the mother, social class, unmarried maternal status, increasing parental ages (continuous analysis), or urban status. We also found no statistically significant associations between the risks of childhood acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, or Hodgkin's disease and the variables studied. CONCLUSION: This study showed no positive results though of reasonable size, and its record linkage design minimised bias. Descriptive studies (eg of time trends of ALL) show that environmental factors must be important for some diagnoses. Work has been done on the risk of ALL in relation to chemicals (eg pesticides) and drugs, dietary factors (eg vitamins), electromagnetic fields and infectious hypotheses (to name some); but whether these or other unknown factors are truly important remains to be seen.","['Wong, Donny I M', 'Dockerty, John D']","['Wong DI', 'Dockerty JD']","['Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. wondo585@student.otago.ac.nz']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Blood Disord,BMC blood disorders,100968550,,,,2006/09/16 09:00,2006/09/16 09:01,['2006/09/16 09:00'],"['2006/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/16 09:01 [medline]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2326-6-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2326-6-5 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Blood Disord. 2006 Sep 14;6:5. doi: 10.1186/1471-2326-6-5.,20060914,,,PMC1592292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect was potentiated by co-treatment with MEK/ERK (PD98059, U0126) and JNK (SP600125, AS601245) inhibitors, but not with p38 (SB203580, SB220025) inhibitors. However, no potentiation was obtained using lonidamine, doxorubicin, or cisplatin instead of As(2)O(3). Apoptosis potentiation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors involved both the intrinsic and extrinsic executionary pathways, as demonstrated by Bax activation and cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and by caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, respectively; and the activation of both pathways was prevented by Bcl-2 over-expression. Treatment with MEK/ERK and JNK inhibitors, but not with p38 inhibitors, caused intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion, which was differentially regulated. Thus, while it was prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in the case of U0126, it behaved as a NAC-insensitive process, regulated at the level of DL-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO)-sensitive enzyme activity, in the case of SP600125. The MEK/ERK inhibitor also potentiated apoptosis and decreased GSH content in As(2)O(3)-treated NB4 human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, but none of these effects were produced by the JNK inhibitor. MEK/ERK and JNK inhibitors did not apparently affect As(2)O(3) transport activity, as measured by intracellular arsenic accumulation. SP600126 greatly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, while BSO and U0126 had little or null effects. These results, which indicate that glutathione is a target of MAP kinases in myeloid leukemia cells, might be exploited to improve the antitumor properties of As(2)O(3), and provide a rationale for the use of kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents.","['Ramos, Adrian M', 'Fernandez, Carlos', 'Amran, Donna', 'Esteban, Diego', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Palacios, Maria A', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Ramos AM', 'Fernandez C', 'Amran D', 'Esteban D', 'de Blas E', 'Palacios MA', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040-Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Peroxides/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2006/09/15 09:00,2007/02/08 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20806 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2006 Dec;209(3):1006-15. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20806.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Forty parents of children who died 1-3 years prior to data collection (structured questionnaire) were invited to participate in the study. RESULTS: The response rate was 32 out of 40 parents (80%). Most frequently mentioned physical symptoms were pain, poor appetite, and fatigue. The children's most mentioned psychological symptoms were sadness, difficulty in talking to their parents about their feelings regarding illness and death and fear of being alone. The symptoms of fear of death of the child and fear of physical symptoms were most frequently mentioned parents' psychological symptoms. Health professionals addressed 82% of the children's physical symptoms, 43% of the children's psychological symptoms, and 56% of the parents' psychological symptoms. Parents indicated that after professional attention the proportion of children's physical symptoms that were completely or partially resolved was 18 and 26%, respectively. For children's psychological symptoms the figures were 9 and 25%, respectively, and for parents' psychological symptoms 2 and 23%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of symptoms of the child with cancer during the palliative phase and their parents is high. Health professionals focus mainly on the physical symptoms of the child. Relief of symptoms could not be achieved for a large proportion of symptoms. Further prospective research is necessary to investigate the kind, frequency and intensity of symptoms in order to tailor optimal palliative care to the needs of both child and parent.","['Theunissen, J M J', 'Hoogerbrugge, P M', 'van Achterberg, T', 'Prins, J B', 'Vernooij-Dassen, M J F J', 'van den Ende, C H M']","['Theunissen JM', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'van Achterberg T', 'Prins JB', 'Vernooij-Dassen MJ', 'van den Ende CH']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands. j.theunissen@cukz.umcn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anorexia/etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Attitude to Death', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/physiopathology/psychology', 'Caregivers/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emotions', 'Fatigue/etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/physiopathology/psychology', 'Male', 'Mobility Limitation', 'Neoplasms/*complications/economics/physiopathology/psychology/therapy', 'Pain/physiopathology', 'Pain Management', 'Palliative Care/economics/*psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Terminal Care/economics/*psychology', 'Treatment Failure']",2006/09/15 09:00,2007/08/25 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21042 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Aug;49(2):160-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toll-like receptors (TLR) belong to a group of pattern recognition receptors, with importance for innate immune response and inflammatory processes. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key regulatory cytokine and has been implicated in lymphomagenesis. Functional polymorphisms in these inflammation-associated genes may affect the susceptibility towards lymphoma. To test this hypothesis, we have genotyped DNA of 710 lymphoma cases and 710 controls within the context of a population-based epidemiological study for 11 functionally important single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR1, -2, -4, -5, -9, IL10 and IL10 receptor (IL10RA). The IL10RA Ser138Gly variant was underrepresented among lymphoma cases (odds ratio (OR)=0.81, 95 per cent confidence interval (95% CI)=0.65-1.02), mainly owing to an inverse association with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The TLR2 -16933T>A variant was associated with a 2.8-fold increased risk of follicular lymphoma (95% CI=1.43-5.59) and a decreased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (OR=0.61, 95% CI=0.38-0.95). Furthermore, the TLR4 Asp299Gly variant was positively associated with the risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (OR=2.76, 95% CI=1.12-6.81) and HL (OR=1.80, 95% CI=0.99-3.26). In conclusion, this study suggests an effect of polymorphisms in factors of the innate immune response in the aetiology of some lymphoma subtypes.","['Nieters, A', 'Beckmann, L', 'Deeg, E', 'Becker, N']","['Nieters A', 'Beckmann L', 'Deeg E', 'Becker N']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. a.nieters@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (Interleukin-10 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Interleukin-10 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*genetics']",2006/09/15 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['6364337 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.gene.6364337 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2006 Dec;7(8):615-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.gene.6364337.

The authors have previously shown that heparin affinity chromatography could be successfully employed for the purification of VSV-G pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-derived vectors giving excellent results in terms of recovery of active particles, reproducibility and selectivity. In this study, the authors examined whether the ability of retrovirus particles to specifically bind to heparin ligands is restricted to VSV-G pseudotypes produced by 293-based packaging cells. It is shown that VSV-G deficient retrovirus particles are captured by a heparin chromatography column as efficiently as VSV-G containing particles. Most strikingly, RD114 pseudotyped retrovirus particles derived from a HT1080-based cell line were found to bind heparin with the same affinity as 293-derived VSV-G pseudotypes. RD114 pseudotyped retrovirus particles were successfully isolated using heparin affinity chromatography obtaining good recoveries of functional particles (43%). These results indicate that heparin affinity chromatography can be extended to the purification of retroviral vectors produced by different packaging cell lines independently of the Env-protein used for pseudotyping.","['Segura, Maria de las Mercedes', 'Kamen, Amine', 'Lavoie, Marie-Claude', 'Garnier, Alain']","['Segura MM', 'Kamen A', 'Lavoie MC', 'Garnier A']","[""Department of Chemical Engineering and Centre de Recherche sur la Fonction, la Structure et l'Ingenierie des Proteines, Universite Laval, Que., Canada G1K 7P4.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,"Journal of chromatography.

The viability of all human leukemia cell lines were not affected by piplartine after 6 h, 9 h, and 12 h exposure, whereas a steady decline was seen after an exposure time of 24 h. The antiproliferative activity of piplartine seemed to be related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis, as revealed by the reduction of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation after 24h of incubation. Piplartine-mediated reduction in cell number was associated with an increasing number of dead cells at a concentration of 10 microg/ml. These findings were corroborated by morphologic analysis. However, at the lowest concentration (2.5 microg/ml), piplartine-treated cells exhibited typical apoptotic morphological changes. The increase in caspase-3 activity was also observed in lysates of piplartine-treated cells (2.5 microg/ml).

Extensive studies have shown that a major fraction of the most studied variants enters cells via an endocytic mechanism. However, controversy surrounds the exact uptake mechanism and whether a specific pathway is utilised. Studies showing inhibition of uptake of protein transduction domains in the presence of ion-transport inhibitors such as amiloride and its more potent analogue 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) suggest a link between peptide internalisation and macropinocytosis. In this study, using immunolabelling of early and late components of the endocytic pathway, we show that treatment of cells with EIPA and to a lesser extent amiloride affects the morphology and subcellular location of early, late endosomes and lysosomes. Enlarged early and late endocytic structures were observed in EIPA-treated cells, and these organelles accumulated in a perinuclear region.

Treatment of the CD34(+) leukaemia cell line KG1a with EIPA in the presence of fluorescent conjugates of HIV-TAT peptide and octaarginine showed distinct vesicular staining in agreement with untreated cells but EIPA-treated cells were additionally characterized by increased localization of the peptides in the cytosol.

In both type of cells, C-1305 at biological relevant concentrations corresponding to EC(90) value, induced a significant increase in the fraction of G2/M cells. The cell cycle perturbations were accompanied by the appearance of sub-G1 fraction, which can be considered as the apoptotic cells population. In both human leukemia cells apoptosis was additionally proved by appearance of DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, PARP cleavage, externalization of phosphatydilserine as well as decrease of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential DeltaPsi(m) and ATP depletion. Treatment of lymphoblastic MOLT4 cells with the C-1305 at EC(90) concentration, caused massive death by apoptosis. Compared to MOLT4 cells, the capacity of HL60 cells to execute apoptosis after C-1305 treatment at equitoxic dose was significantly weaker, but very effective at high concentration (4x EC(90)). These differences could originate from different sensitivity of both cell types to cytotoxic action of C-1305 (EC(50) value for MOLT4 cells was 8 times lower than for HL60 cells and the EC(90) value was 14 times lower, respectively). Collectively, these results show that C-1305 is a novel and potent compound which induces G2/M arrest and subsequent apoptosis of human leukemia cells. This strong ability to induce apoptosis of tumor cells support the view that C-1305 could be consider as a new potent and promising antitumor agent.","['Augustin, Ewa', 'Mos-Rompa, Anna', 'Skwarska, Anna', 'Witkowski, Jacek M', 'Konopa, Jerzy']","['Augustin E', 'Mos-Rompa A', 'Skwarska A', 'Witkowski JM', 'Konopa J']","['Gdansk University of Technology, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Narutowicza St. 11/12, 80-952 Gdansk, Poland. augustin@chem.pg.gda.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (C 1305)', '0 (Triazoles)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Acridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Triazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2006/09/15 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00489-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.07.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Dec 15;72(12):1668-79. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.07.035.

As a result, the problems of these patients, such as thyroid diseases, leukemia, and Alzheimer disease, would be encountered more frequently. In this study, we aimed to perform the brain perfusion of children with Down syndrome by technetium 99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to determine the relationship between brain perfusion and epilepsy, thyroid function tests, congenital heart disease, and level of mental and motor development. Thirty patients with Down syndrome, aged between 1 and 15 years, were included in our study. Demographic data, the existence of epilepsy and congenital heart defects, the level of mental and motor development, serum levels of thyroid hormones, and autoantibodies were determined. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cerebral SPECT was performed in all cases to evaluate the brain perfusion pattern. According to the visual evaluation of cerebral SPECT results, hypoperfusion was detected in 11 cases (37%). Patients with cerebral hypoperfusion (group 1) and patients with normal cerebral perfusion (group 2) were compared. There was no difference between group 1 and group 2 in terms of demographic data, congenital heart defects, IQ levels, thyroid hormones, and autoantibodies, but the incidence of epilepsy was significantly higher in group 1 (P<.001). When motor and mental development levels were compared, it was found that cases in group 1 were significantly more retarded in personal-social and fine motor skills (P<.05). The present study showed that cerebral hypoperfusion in children with Down syndrome is mostly related to epilepsy and the other coexisting conditions, congenital heart disease and hypothyroidism. Patients with cerebral hypoperfusion also have more retarded developmental levels, especially in personal-social and fine motor skills.","['Altiay, Suriye', 'Kaya, Meryem', 'Karasalihoglu, Serap', 'Gultekin, Aziz', 'Oner, Naci', 'Biner, Betul']","['Altiay S', 'Kaya M', 'Karasalihoglu S', 'Gultekin A', 'Oner N', 'Biner B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Trakya University Medical Faculty, Edirne Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Child Neurol,Journal of child neurology,8606714,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '3B744AG22N (Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology', 'Child', '*Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Epilepsy/complications/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/complications/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/complications/*physiopathology', 'Infant', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Motor Skills', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']",2006/09/15 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/08830738060210070901 [doi]'],ppublish,J Child Neurol. 2006 Jul;21(7):610-4. doi: 10.1177/08830738060210070901.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heparanase is an endo-beta-D-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate chains on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, activity that closely correlates with cell invasion, angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. The study was undertaken to investigate the involvement of heparanase in TF expression. METHODS: Tumor-derived cell lines were transfected with heparanase cDNA and TF expression was examined. The effect of exogenous addition of active and inactive heparanase on TF expression and activity was studied in tumor cell lines and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. TF expression was also explored in heparanase over-expressing transgenic (Tg) mice. Blast cells were collected from acute leukemia patients and TF and heparanase expression levels were analyzed. RESULTS: Over-expression of heparanase in tumor-derived cell lines resulted in a 2-fold increase in TF expression levels, and a similar trend was observed in heparanase Tg mice in vivo. Likewise, exogenous addition of heparanase to endothelial or tumor-derived cells resulted in enhanced TF expression and activity. Interestingly, TF expression was also induced in response to enzymatically inactive heparanase, suggesting that this effect was independent of heparanase enzymatic activity. The regulatory effect of heparanase on TF expression involved activation of the p38 signaling pathway. A positive correlation between TF expression levels and heparanase activity was found in blasts collected from 22 acute leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in addition to its well-known function as an enzyme paving a way for invading cells, heparanase also participates in the regulation of TF gene expression and its related coagulation pathways.","['Nadir, Y', 'Brenner, B', 'Zetser, A', 'Ilan, N', 'Shafat, I', 'Zcharia, E', 'Goldshmidt, O', 'Vlodavsky, I']","['Nadir Y', 'Brenner B', 'Zetser A', 'Ilan N', 'Shafat I', 'Zcharia E', 'Goldshmidt O', 'Vlodavsky I']","['Cancer and Vascular Biology Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,"['9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 4.2.2.7 (Heparin Lyase)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Heparin Lyase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis']",2006/09/15 09:00,2006/12/12 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['JTH2212 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02212.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2006 Nov;4(11):2443-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02212.x.

Several mechanisms of resistance have been described. Because of lack of simple assays for analysing these mechanisms, their relative impact on a given effector-target pair is mostly unknown. We here analysed the combination of the Granzyme B (GrB) enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) for the assessment of NK cell reactivity and cytotoxicity assays to estimate target cell escape mechanisms. Target cell recognition failure leads to negative GrB ELISPOT results, whereas target cell resistance shows positive GrB ELISPOT results in the absence of cytotoxicity. We confronted NK cells with the sensitive target cell line K562, and with the resistant cell lines ML2, SupB15 and Raji. ML2 cells sufficiently activated GrB-release whilst being resistant against cytotoxic granules of NK cells. Partial resistance of Raji results from the interaction of HLA class I with inhibitory killer immunglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on the NK cells. Failure of target recognition by HLA class I-KIR interaction, lacking ligands to stimulatory NK cell receptors and partial resistance to cytotoxic granules all contributed to resistance of SupB15. In conclusion, revealing the mechanisms of resistance against NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity may allow improving the results of NK-based immunotherapy.","['Hasenkamp, J', 'Borgerding, A', 'Wulf, G', 'Uhrberg, M', 'Jung, W', 'Dingeldein, S', 'Truemper, L', 'Glass, B']","['Hasenkamp J', 'Borgerding A', 'Wulf G', 'Uhrberg M', 'Jung W', 'Dingeldein S', 'Truemper L', 'Glass B']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Georg-August University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany. j.hasenkamp@med.uni-goettingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (HLA-A3 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Granzymes', 'HLA-A3 Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis']",2006/09/15 09:00,2006/11/01 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['SJI1803 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3083.2006.01803.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2006 Oct;64(4):444-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2006.01803.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important component of the rise in costs will be specialty pharmaceuticals, including a group of drugs that are self-administered and that cost at least 1,000 dollars/month. The rate of growth in expenditures on specialty pharmaceuticals has been 34% per year. Although all these drugs confer benefits, the degree of benefit varies from dramatic (e.g., imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia) to cost-effective (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers for rheumatoid arthritis) to more modest (e.g., disease-modifying drugs used in multiple sclerosis). Historically, when costs within the Medicare program have risen, Congress has enacted price controls, as it did with hospitalization, physician services, and outpatient care. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) currently prohibits such an approach. Resorting instead to competition from generic drugs will be of little utility, because there is currently no mechanism to allow biogeneric drugs and patents in the biopharmaceutical industry to limit competition. Controlling the cost of the Medicare Part D program, as dramatically illustrated by the case of specialty pharmaceuticals, will require patent reform, giving the Food and Drug Administration jurisdiction over biogenerics, and amending the MMA to allow the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to institute price controls.","['Gillick, Muriel R']",['Gillick MR'],"['Department of Ambulatory Care and Prevention, Harvard Medical School/Harvard Pilgrim, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA. mgillick@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Am Geriatr Soc,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,7503062,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cost Control', '*Drug Costs', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Pharmaceutical Services/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Medicare/*economics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States']",2006/09/15 09:00,2006/10/21 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['JGS845 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1532-5415.2006.00845.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Geriatr Soc. 2006 Sep;54(9):1442-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2006.00845.x.,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PBTDs are a new class of valid candidates for the treatment of CML.","['Silvestri, Romano', 'Marfe, Gabriella', 'Artico, Marino', 'La Regina, Giuseppe', 'Lavecchia, Antonio', 'Novellino, Ettore', 'Morgante, Emanuela', 'Di Stefano, Carla', 'Catalano, Gianfranco', 'Filomeni, Giuseppe', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Ciriolo, Maria Rosa', 'Russo, Matteo Antonio', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Cirilli, Roberto', 'La Torre, Francesco', 'Sinibaldi Salimei, Paola']","['Silvestri R', 'Marfe G', 'Artico M', 'La Regina G', 'Lavecchia A', 'Novellino E', 'Morgante E', 'Di Stefano C', 'Catalano G', 'Filomeni G', 'Abruzzese E', 'Ciriolo MR', 'Russo MA', 'Amadori S', 'Cirilli R', 'La Torre F', 'Sinibaldi Salimei P']","['Dipartimento di Studi Farmaceutici, Universita La Sapienza, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Roma, Italy. romano.silvestri@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Thiazepines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thiazepines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/09/15 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/09/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm0602716 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2006 Sep 21;49(19):5840-4. doi: 10.1021/jm0602716.,,,,,,"['J Med Chem. 2006 Nov 30;49(24):7252.
