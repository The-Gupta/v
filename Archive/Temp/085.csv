However, the mechanisms of action are not well understood, and whether they could have clinical impact on radiotherapy for leukemia is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) can increase radiosensitivity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through posttranslational modification of Rad51 protein responses and selective inhibition of the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. Our data also showed that AML cells with mutant, constitutively active FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) were more radiation sensitive, caused by compromised non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Furthermore, SAHA-induced radiosensitization were enhanced in AML cells with expression of these FLT3 mutants. The results of this study suggest that SAHA, a recently approved HDI in clinical trials, may act as a candidate component for novel conditioning regimens to improve efficacy for AML patients undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","['Chen, Xufeng', 'Radany, Eric H', 'Wong, Patty', 'Ma, Shenglin', 'Wu, Kan', 'Wang, Bing', 'Wong, Jeffrey Y C']","['Chen X', 'Radany EH', 'Wong P', 'Ma S', 'Wu K', 'Wang B', 'Wong JY']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, California, United States of America ; Department of Radiation Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical Group, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, California, United States of America.', ""Department of Radiation Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical Group, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Radiation Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical Group, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Radiation Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical Group, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131219,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Rad51 Recombinase/metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Vorinostat', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",PMC3868602,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/10/14 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0084515 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-32991 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 19;8(12):e84515. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084515. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We asked whether RNA-seq is suitable for the detection of driver mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). These leukemias are caused by a combination of gene fusions, over-expression of transcription factors and cooperative point mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We analyzed 31 T-ALL patient samples and 18 T-ALL cell lines by high-coverage paired-end RNA-seq. First, we optimized the detection of SNVs in RNA-seq data by comparing the results with exome re-sequencing data. We identified known driver genes with recurrent protein altering variations, as well as several new candidates including H3F3A, PTK2B, and STAT5B. Next, we determined accurate gene expression levels from the RNA-seq data through normalizations and batch effect removal, and used these to classify patients into T-ALL subtypes. Finally, we detected gene fusions, of which several can explain the over-expression of key driver genes such as TLX1, PLAG1, LMO1, or NKX2-1; and others result in novel fusion transcripts encoding activated kinases (SSBP2-FER and TPM3-JAK2) or involving MLLT10. In conclusion, we present novel analysis pipelines for variant calling, variant filtering, and expression normalization on RNA-seq data, and successfully applied these for the detection of translocations, point mutations, INDELs, exon-skipping events, and expression perturbations in T-ALL.","['Atak, Zeynep Kalender', 'Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Hulselmans, Gert', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Devasia, Arun George', 'Geerdens, Ellen', 'Mentens, Nicole', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Durinck, Kaat', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Wlodarska, Iwona', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Foa, Robin', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Cools, Jan', 'Aerts, Stein']","['Atak ZK', 'Gianfelici V', 'Hulselmans G', 'De Keersmaecker K', 'Devasia AG', 'Geerdens E', 'Mentens N', 'Chiaretti S', 'Durinck K', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Wlodarska I', 'Cloos J', 'Foa R', 'Speleman F', 'Cools J', 'Aerts S']","['Laboratory of Computational Biology, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium ; Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, 'Sapienza' University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Laboratory of Computational Biology, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Computational Biology, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium ; Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, 'Sapienza' University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Hematology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, 'Sapienza' University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Computational Biology, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exome/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Fusion', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'INDEL Mutation/genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",PMC3868543,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/08/21 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1003997 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-13-01641 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2013;9(12):e1003997. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003997.

Clinical outcome can be substantially improved by ERBB2-targeted therapy. Lapatinib is a potent, orally bioavailable small molecule that reversibly and selectively inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR1 or ERBB1) and ERBB2 tyrosine kinases. Lapatinib binds the adenosine triphosphate-binding site of the receptor's intracellular domain to inhibit tumor cell growth. This review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of lapatinib, and reviews both Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational uses of lapatinib in breast cancer therapy. The drug is generally well tolerated in patients, with diarrhea and rashes being the most common (usually mild or moderate) adverse effects. Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib has infrequent adverse effects on cardiac function. Lapatinib has substantial activity for advanced ERBB2-positive breast cancer, particularly in combination with capecitabine, following progression after anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. Lapatinib combined with capecitabine yielded significant improvements in time to progression and response rate compared with capecitabine alone. This drug can also be combined with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer, for whom hormonal therapy is indicated. Lapatinib has shown early promise in treatment of central nervous system metastasis and is being further evaluated in various clinical settings.","['Liao, Julia', 'Gallas, Michelle', 'Pegram, Mark', 'Slingerland, Joyce']","['Liao J', 'Gallas M', 'Pegram M', 'Slingerland J']","['Braman Family Breast Cancer institute, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA.', 'Braman Family Breast Cancer institute, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA.', 'Braman Family Breast Cancer institute, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA ; Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA ; Departments of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Braman Family Breast Cancer institute, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA ; Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA ; Departments of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA ; Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101115,New Zealand,Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press),Breast cancer (Dove Medical Press),101591856,,,,PMC3846530,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/BCTT.S5929 [doi]', 'bctt-2-079 [pii]']",epublish,Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press). 2010 Nov 15;2:79-91. doi: 10.2147/BCTT.S5929.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ERBB family', 'ERBB2', 'breast cancer', 'capecitabine', 'lapatinib', 'letrozole', 'trastuzumab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that Bach2 plays crucial roles in maintaining T cell quiescence and governing the differentiation, activation, and survival of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Bach2-deficient T cells display spontaneous activation and produce elevated levels of Th1/Th2-type cytokines. Without Bach2, Treg cells exhibit diminished Foxp3 expression, depleted numbers, hyperactivation, enhanced proliferation, and profound loss of competitive fitness in vivo. Mechanistically, reduced survival of Bach2-deficient Treg cells was associated with reduced Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels and elevated Bim/Bcl-2 ratio. Additionally, Bach2 deficiency induced selective loss of Helios(-)Foxp3(+) Treg cells and a Treg cell transcriptome skewed toward the Th1/Th2 effector program at the expense of the Treg program. In vitro experiments confirmed that Bach2: 1) is indispensable for TCR/TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 expression; and 2) mitigates aberrant differentiation of Treg cells by repression of the competing Gata3-driven Th2 effector program. Importantly, perturbations in the differentiation of induced Treg cells was linked to a fatal Th2-type chronic inflammatory lung disease in Bach2-deficient mice. Thus, Bach2 enforces T cell quiescence, promotes the development and survival of Treg lineage, restrains aberrant differentiation of Treg cells, and protects against immune-mediated diseases.","['Kim, Eui Ho', 'Gasper, David J', 'Lee, Song Hee', 'Plisch, Erin Hemmila', 'Svaren, John', 'Suresh, M']","['Kim EH', 'Gasper DJ', 'Lee SH', 'Plisch EH', 'Svaren J', 'Suresh M']","['Department of Pathobiological Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131223,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Bach2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Prdm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Homeostasis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphopoiesis/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pulmonary Eosinophilia/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3946995,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302378 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302378 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Feb 1;192(3):985-95. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302378.

These oncogenic fusion proteins are responsible for the initiation of a downstream transcriptional program leading to the expression of factors such as MEIS1 and HOXA9, which in turn can replace MLL-fusion proteins in overexpression experiments. To what extent MLL fusion proteins act on their own during tumor initiation, or if they collaborate with other transcriptional regulators, is unclear. Here, we have compared gene expression profiles from human MLL-rearranged AML to normal progenitors and identified the myeloid tumor suppressor C/EBPalpha as a putative collaborator in MLL-rearranged AML. Interestingly, we find that deletion of Cebpa rendered murine hematopoietic progenitors completely resistant to MLL-ENL-induced leukemic transformation, whereas C/EBPalpha was dispensable in already established AMLs. Furthermore, we show that Cebpa-deficient granulocytic-monocytic progenitors were equally resistant to transformation and that C/EBPalpha collaborates with MLL-ENL in the induction of a transcriptional program, which is also apparent in human AML. Thus, our studies demonstrate a key role of C/EBPalpha in MLL fusion-driven transformation and find that it sharply demarcates tumor initiation and maintenance.","['Ohlsson, Ewa', 'Hasemann, Marie Sigurd', 'Willer, Anton', 'Lauridsen, Felicia Kathrine Bratt', 'Rapin, Nicolas', 'Jendholm, Johan', 'Porse, Bo Torben']","['Ohlsson E', 'Hasemann MS', 'Willer A', 'Lauridsen FK', 'Rapin N', 'Jendholm J', 'Porse BT']","['The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences; 2 Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC); 3 Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem) Faculty of Health Sciences; 4 The Bioinformatic Centre, Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131223,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3892979,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20130932 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20130932 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2014 Jan 13;211(1):5-13. doi: 10.1084/jem.20130932.

Prolonged HD-CSP therapy was well tolerated. Drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia may pose a potential limitation for continued HD-CSP use in highly susceptible patients with hematologic neoplasms and stem cell transplantation.","['Safdar, Amar', 'Rodriguez, Gilhen', 'Zuniga, Jorge', 'Al Akhrass, Fadi', 'Pande, Anupam']","['Safdar A', 'Rodriguez G', 'Zuniga J', 'Al Akhrass F', 'Pande A']","['Department of Medicine, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA amar.safdar@nyumc.org.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, University of Texas M.

Conversely, nonadherence to imatinib and other TKIs undoubtedly results in disease progression and treatment resistance. We examined trends in imatinib expenditures from 2002 to 2011 and assessed the association between copayment requirements for imatinib and TKI adherence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used MarketScan health plan claims from 2002 to 2011 to identify adults (age 18 to 64 years) with CML who initiated imatinib therapy between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2011, and had insurance coverage for at least 3 months before through 6 months after initiation (N = 1,541). Primary outcomes were TKI discontinuation and nonadherence. The primary independent variable was out-of-pocket cost for a 30-day supply of imatinib. By using a propensity-score weighted sample, we estimated the risk of discontinuation and nonadherence for patients with higher (top quartile) versus lower copayments. RESULTS: Monthly copayments for imatinib averaged $108; median copayments were $30 (range, $0 to $4,792). Mean total monthly expenditures for imatinib nearly doubled between 2002 and 2011, from $2,798 to $4,892. Approximately 17% of patients with higher copayments and 10% with lower copayments discontinued TKIs during the first 180 days following initiation (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.22). Similarly, patients with higher copayments were 42% more likely to be nonadherent (aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.69). CONCLUSION: Patients with higher copayments are more likely to discontinue or be nonadherent to TKIs. Given the importance of these therapies for patients with CML, our data suggest a critical need to reduce patient costs for these therapies.","['Dusetzina, Stacie B', 'Winn, Aaron N', 'Abel, Gregory A', 'Huskamp, Haiden A', 'Keating, Nancy L']","['Dusetzina SB', 'Winn AN', 'Abel GA', 'Huskamp HA', 'Keating NL']","[""Stacie B.

Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT) might improve survival at the expense of increased toxicity. It remains unknown for which patients alloSCT is preferable. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the outcome of 185 matched pairs of a large multicenter clinical trial (AMLCG99). Patients younger than 60 years who underwent alloSCT in first remission (CR1) were matched to patients who received conventional postremission therapy. The main matching criteria were AML type, cytogenetic risk group, patient age, and time in first CR. RESULTS: In the overall pairwise compared AML population, the projected 7-year overall survival (OS) rate was 58% for the alloSCT and 46% for the conventional postremission treatment group (P = .037; log-rank test). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was 52% in the alloSCT group compared with 33% in the control group (P < .001). OS was significantly better for alloSCT in patient subgroups with nonfavorable chromosomal aberrations, patients older than 45 years, and patients with secondary AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. For the entire patient cohort, postremission therapy was an independent factor for OS (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89 for alloSCT v conventional chemotherapy), among age, cytogenetics, and bone marrow blasts after the first induction cycle. CONCLUSION: AlloSCT is the most potent postremission therapy for AML and is particularly active for patients 45 to 59 years of age and/or those with high-risk cytogenetics.","['Stelljes, Matthias', 'Krug, Utz', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Braess, Jan', 'Sauerland, Maria C', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Ligges, Sandra', 'Sauer, Tim', 'Tschanter, Petra', 'Thoennissen, Gabriela B', 'Berning, Bjorna', 'Kolb, Hans J', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Scheid, Christoph', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Woermann, Bernhard J', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Buchner, Thomas']","['Stelljes M', 'Krug U', 'Beelen DW', 'Braess J', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A', 'Ligges S', 'Sauer T', 'Tschanter P', 'Thoennissen GB', 'Berning B', 'Kolb HJ', 'Reichle A', 'Holler E', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Arnold R', 'Scheid C', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Woermann BJ', 'Hiddemann W', 'Berdel WE', 'Buchner T']","['Matthias Stelljes, Utz Krug, Maria C.

Recent studies following widespread FeLV vaccination in the UK are lacking. The aim of this retrospective multi-institutional study was to re-evaluate the signalment, retroviral status, response to chemotherapy, survival and prognostic indicators in feline mediastinal lymphoma cases in the post-vaccination era. Records of cats with clinical signs associated with a mediastinal mass and cytologically/histologically confirmed lymphoma were reviewed from five UK referral centres (1998-2010). Treatment response, survival and prognostic indicators were assessed in treated cats with follow-up data. Fifty-five cases were reviewed. The median age was 3 years (range, 0.5-12 years); 12 cats (21.8%) were Siamese; and the male to female ratio was 3.2:1.0. Five cats were FeLV-positive and two were feline immunodeficiency-positive. Chemotherapy response and survival was evaluated in 38 cats. Overall response was 94.7%; complete (CR) and partial response (PR) rates did not differ significantly between protocols: COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) (n = 26, CR 61.5%, PR 34.0%); Madison-Wisconsin (MW) (n = 12, CR 66.7%, PR 25.0%). Overall median survival was 373 days (range, 20-2015 days) (COP 484 days [range, 20-980 days]; MW 211 days [range, 24-2015 days] [P = 0.892]). Cats achieving CR survived longer (980 days vs 42 days for PR; P = 0.032). Age, breed, sex, location (mediastinal vs mediastinal plus other sites), retroviral status and glucocorticoid pretreatment did not affect response or survival. Feline mediastinal lymphoma cases frequently responded to chemotherapy with durable survival times, particularly in cats achieving CR. The prevalence of FeLV-antigenaemic cats was low; males and young Siamese cats appeared to be over-represented.","['Fabrizio, Francesca', 'Calam, Amy E', 'Dobson, Jane M', 'Middleton, Stephanie A', 'Murphy, Sue', 'Taylor, Samantha S', 'Schwartz, Anita', 'Stell, Anneliese J']","['Fabrizio F', 'Calam AE', 'Dobson JM', 'Middleton SA', 'Murphy S', 'Taylor SS', 'Schwartz A', 'Stell AJ']","['North Downs Specialist Referrals, Bletchingley, UK fabriziofrancesca@hotmail.com.', 'The Veterinary Centre, Henley-on-Thames, UK.', 'University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Royal Veterinary College, North Mymms, Hatfield, UK.', 'AHT, Lanwades Park, Kentford, UK.', 'University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Royal Veterinary College, North Mymms, Hatfield, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131223,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cat Diseases/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2013/12/25 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1098612X13516621 [pii]', '10.1177/1098612X13516621 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2014 Aug;16(8):637-44. doi: 10.1177/1098612X13516621.

Here we identified the biochemical basis for its remarkable in vivo activity. Allo-aca decomposed within 30 min in pooled human serum and was undetectable beyond the same time period from mouse plasma during pharmacokinetic measurements. The C max of 8.9 mug/mL at 5 min corresponds to approximately 22% injected peptide present in the circulation. The half-life was extended to over 2 h in bovine vitreous fluid and 10 h in human tears suggesting potential efficacy in ophthalmic diseases. The peptide retained picomolar anti-proliferation activity against a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line; addition of a C-terminal biotin label increased the IC50 value by approximately 200-fold. In surface plasmon resonance assays with the biotin-labeled peptide immobilized to a NeutrAvidin-coated chip, Allo-aca exhibited exceptionally tight binding to the binding domain of the human leptin receptor with ka = 5 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) and kdiss = 1.5 x 10(-4) s(-1) values.

Outcomes associated with intensive care support have not been studied in a large pediatric acute myeloid leukemia population. Our objective was to determine hospital mortality of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients requiring intensive care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of children hospitalized between 1999 and 2010. Use of intensive care was defined by utilization of specific procedures and resources. The primary endpoint was hospital mortality. SETTING: Forty-three children's hospitals contributing data to the Pediatric Health Information System database. PATIENTS: Patients who are newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and who are 28 days through 18 years old (n = 1,673) hospitalized any time from initial diagnosis through 9 months following diagnosis or until stem cell transplant. A reference cohort of all nononcology pediatric admissions using the same intensive care resources in the same time period (n = 242,192 admissions) was also studied. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One-third of pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (553 of 1,673) required intensive care during a hospitalization within 9 months of diagnosis. Among intensive care admissions, mortality was higher in the acute myeloid leukemia cohort compared with the nononcology cohort (18.6% vs 6.5%; odds ratio, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.64-3.94). However, when sepsis was present, mortality was not significantly different between cohorts (21.9% vs 19.5%; odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.89-1.53). Mortality was consistently higher for each type of organ failure in the acute myeloid leukemia cohort versus the nononcology cohort; however, mortality did not exceed 40% unless there were four or more organ failures in the admission. Mortality for admissions requiring intensive care decreased over time for both cohorts (23.7% in 1999-2003 vs 16.4% in 2004-2010 in the acute myeloid leukemia cohort, p = 0.0367; and 7.5% in 1999-2003 vs 6.5% in 2004-2010 in the nononcology cohort, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia frequently required intensive care resources, with mortality rates substantially lower than previously reported.

The prognostic value of IKZF1 deletions was evaluated in 2 cohorts of BCR-ABL1-positive BCP-ALL patients, before tyrosine kinase inhibitors (pre-TKI) and after introduction of imatinib (in the European Study for Philadelphia-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia [EsPhALL]). In 126/191 (66%) cases an IKZF1 deletion was detected. In the pre-TKI cohort, IKZF1-deleted patients had an unfavorable outcome compared with wild-type patients (4-year disease-free survival [DFS] of 30.0 +/- 6.8% vs 57.5 +/- 9.4%; P = .01). In the EsPhALL cohort, the IKZF1 deletions were associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients stratified in the good-risk arm based on early clinical response (4-year DFS of 51.9 +/- 8.8% for IKZF1-deleted vs 78.6 +/- 13.9% for IKZF1 wild-type; P = .03), even when treated with imatinib (4-year DFS of 55.5 +/- 9.5% for IKZF1-deleted vs 75.0 +/- 21.7% for IKZF1 wild-type; P = .05). In conclusion, the highly unfavorable outcome for childhood BCR-ABL1-positive BCP-ALL with IKZF1 deletions, irrespective of imatinib exposure, underscores the need for alternative therapies. In contrast, good-risk patients with IKZF1 wild-type responded remarkably well to imatinib-containing regimens, providing a rationale to potentially avoid hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in this subset of patients.","['van der Veer, Arian', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Mottadelli, Federica', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Te Kronnie, Gertruuy', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Cave, Helene', 'Trka, Jan', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['van der Veer A', 'Zaliova M', 'Mottadelli F', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Harrison CJ', 'Cave H', 'Trka J', 'Saha V', 'Schrappe M', 'Pieters R', 'Biondi A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Stanulla M', 'den Boer ML', 'Cazzaniga G']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131223,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Rate']",,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35892-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-06-509794 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Mar 13;123(11):1691-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-06-509794.

Frequent clinical consequences of these diseases include not only an increased risk of thrombosis but also leukemic transformation, which carries a particularly poor prognosis. Here, we discuss the recent identification of risk factors for leukemic transformation, elucidate mechanisms contributing to leukemic transformation, as well as highlight the development of new treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Significant progress in the understanding of the biology of MPNs has been made in recent years, particularly with the discovery that mutations in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway cause unregulated activation. These genetic insights have been extended to leukemic transformation and have revealed a host of genetic alterations that occur at the time of transformation, and that may identify patients at risk for leukemic transformation. Such studies have demonstrated that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolved from a chronic phase MPN is distinct from de-novo AML both genetically and clinically given its resistance to conventional antileukemic therapy. SUMMARY: Leukemic transformation of an MPN remains a significant clinical challenge. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular events that contribute to the development of leukemic transformation will need to be utilized in order to produce rational therapeutic approaches for this largely fatal disease.","['Rampal, Raajit', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Rampal R', 'Mascarenhas J']","['aLeukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center bTisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Risk Factors']",,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000017 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Mar;21(2):65-71. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to investigate its antiproliferative, antimigratory and pro-apoptotic effects in colorectal cancer cell lines, SW480 and CC531. The antiproliferative effect was determined by (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) dye reduction assay following exposure to erufosine (3.1-100 microM) for 24-72 h. The antimigratory effect of erufosine (1.6-6 microM) was investigated by a wound healing assay for 12-48 h. Caspase-3/-7 activity was measured to detect apoptotic cell death. Erufosine inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50 values following 72 h of incubation were 3.4 and 25.4 microM for SW480 and CC531 cells, respectively. erufosine at concentrations of 50 and 100 microM induced caspase-3/-7 activity concentration-dependently in SW480 cells, but only at 100 microM in CC531 cells. Incubation of SW480 cells with erufosine (1.56 microM) for 48 h inhibited migration into the scratched area by 54% as compared to the untreated cells; whereas in CC531 cells, the wound width in the erufosine-treated (1.56-6.25 microM) cells following 48 h was closed 2-fold slower than the rate in the untreated group. Erufosine (25 microM) attenuated osteonectin expression and abolished COL1A1 expression in CC531 cells. Erufosine appears to be a promising treatment agent for colorectal cancer. Rat CC531 cells are less sensitive to erufosine than human SW480 cells.","['Kaleagasioglu, Ferda', 'Berger, Martin R']","['Kaleagasioglu F', 'Berger MR']","['Toxicology and Chemotherapy Unit, German Cancer Research Center, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Toxicology and Chemotherapy Unit, German Cancer Research Center, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131220,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Osteonectin)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (erucylphospho-N,N,N-trimethylpropylammonium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Collagen Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Osteonectin/genetics/metabolism', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2942 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2014 Mar;31(3):1407-16. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2942.

Rotenone, a complex I-specific inhibitor, dose-dependently increased the mitochondrial level of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), decreased clonogenic survival, and induced apoptosis. A strong correlation was found between the mitochondrial levels of NADH and oxidized flavin mononucleotide (FMNox) in rotenone-, menadione- and quercetin-treated cells. Rotenone enhanced DL dose-dependently, whereas quercetin and menadione inhibited DL as well as NADH or FMNox. Collectively, the data suggest that DL of Jurkat cells originates mainly from mitochondrial complex I, which functions predominantly as a dimer and less frequently as a tetramer. In individual monomers, both pairs of pyridine nucleotide (NADH/reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) sites and flavin (FMN-a/FMN-b) sites appear to bind cooperatively their specific ligands. Enhancement of delayed red-light emission by rotenone suggests that the mean time for one-electron reduction of ubiquinone or FMN-a by the terminal Fe/S center (N2) is 20 or 284 mus, respectively. All these findings suggest that DL spectroscopy could be used as a reliable, sensitive, and robust technique to probe electron flow within complex I in situ.","['Baran, Irina', 'Ionescu, Diana', 'Privitera, Simona', 'Scordino, Agata', 'Mocanu, Maria Magdalena', 'Musumeci, Francesco', 'Grasso, Rosaria', 'Gulino, Marisa', 'Iftime, Adrian', 'Tofolean, Ioana Teodora', 'Garaiman, Alexandru', 'Goicea, Alexandru', 'Irimia, Ruxandra', 'Dimancea, Alexandru', 'Ganea, Constanta']","['Baran I', 'Ionescu D', 'Privitera S', 'Scordino A', 'Mocanu MM', 'Musumeci F', 'Grasso R', 'Gulino M', 'Iftime A', 'Tofolean IT', 'Garaiman A', 'Goicea A', 'Irimia R', 'Dimancea A', 'Ganea C']","['""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Biophysics, 8 Eroii Sanitari, 050474 Bucharest, Romania.', '""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Biophysics, 8 Eroii Sanitari, 050474 Bucharest, Romania.', 'Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare-Laboratori Nazionali del Sud, 62 via S.

METHODS: Using an objective observational method (electronic monitoring), adherence was examined for 139 patients aged 7-19 years diagnosed with ALL or LBL across 6 centers. RESULTS: The mean adherence percentage was 86.2%. Adherence rates declined over the 1-month of follow-up to 83%. 3 linear trajectories of 6-mercaptopurine adherence were identified: (1) exemplary adherence (n = 99): Averaging nearly 100%; (2) deteriorating (n = 23): Adherence decreased from 100 to 60%; and (3) chronically poor adherence (n = 9): Averaging 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence promotion interventions might be tailored to subgroups of patients who demonstrated problematic patterns of treatment adherence that could place them at risk for relapse. This research demonstrates the importance of using objective real-time measures of medication adherence for measuring and documenting adherence patterns.","['Rohan, Jennifer M', 'Drotar, Dennis',

In recent years, we have begun to understand the complex crosstalk between the neoplastic cells and other immune cells, such as T and NK cells, and stromal cells, as well as the signaling pathways that become aberrantly activated through this dialogue (e.g. B-cell receptor, Toll-like receptor and NF-?B signaling). In this series of reviews, the intricate interplay between lymphoma cells and 'by-stander' cells will be illustrated in representative lymphoma entities, namely Hodgkin lymphomas, follicular lymphomas, marginal-zone lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and T-cell lymphomas, where the crucial role played by the microenvironment has become particularly evident. Furthermore, important clues to the pathobiology of lymphomas have emerged from (i) the recognition of pre-malignant conditions, such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis or in situ lymphomas, (ii) the identification of microbial and/or auto-antigens that are linked to particular entities, as well as (iii) the established increased risk of lymphomas in certain autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, all critical aspects that will be further elaborated in this thematic issue. Our increasing knowledge of these interactions and associations has finally allowed us to design targeted or immune-mediated strategies to interfere with the lymphoma microenvironment, thereby opening promising therapeutic avenues on the road to cure for these yet incurable diseases.","['Rosenquist, Richard', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Rosenquist R', 'Davi F', 'Ghia P']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

Since most B-cell leukaemias and lymphomas retain CD19 expression, it represents an excellent target for immunotherapy of these malignant disorders. Over the past 10 years, compelling pre-clinical evidence has accrued to indicate that expression of a CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in peripheral blood T-cells exerts therapeutic efficacy in diverse models of B-cell malignancy. Building on this, clinical studies are ongoing in several centres in which autologous CD19-specific CAR T-cells are undergoing evaluation in patients with acute and chronic B-cell leukaemia and refractory lymphoma. Early data have generated considerable excitement, providing grounds to speculate that CAR-based immunotherapy will radically alter existing management paradigms in B-cell malignancy.

Rapid and sensitive detection of leukaemic subclones carrying such changes, referred to as compound mutations, is therefore of increasing clinical relevance. However, current diagnostic methods including next generation sequencing (NGS) of short fragments do not optimally meet these requirements. We have therefore established a long-range (LR) NGS approach permitting massively parallel sequencing of the entire TKD length of 933bp in a single read using 454 sequencing with the GS FLX+ instrument (454 Life Sciences). By testing a series of individual and consecutive specimens derived from six patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, we demonstrate that long-range NGS analysis permits sensitive identification of mutations and their assignment to the same or to separate subclones. This approach also facilitates readily interpretable documentation of insertions and deletions in the entire BCR-ABL1 TKD. The long-range NGS findings were reevaluated by an independent technical approach in select cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons of the BCR-ABL1 TKD derived from individual specimens were subcloned into pGEM(R)-T plasmids, and >100 individual clones were subjected to analysis by Sanger sequencing. The NGS results were confirmed, thus documenting the reliability of the new technology. Long-range NGS analysis therefore provides an economic approach to the identification of compound mutations and other genetic alterations in the entire BCR-ABL1 TKD, and represents an important advancement of the diagnostic armamentarium for rapid assessment of impending resistant disease.","['Kastner, R', 'Zopf, A', 'Preuner, S', 'Proll, J', 'Niklas, N', 'Foskett, P', 'Valent, P', 'Lion, T', 'Gabriel, C']","['Kastner R', 'Zopf A', 'Preuner S', 'Proll J', 'Niklas N', 'Foskett P', 'Valent P', 'Lion T', 'Gabriel C']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria; Labdia Labordiagnostik GmbH, Vienna, Austria."", 'Red Cross Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Linz, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria; Labdia Labordiagnostik GmbH, Vienna, Austria."", 'Red Cross Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Linz, Austria.', 'Red Cross Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Linz, Austria.', 'Imperial Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria; Labdia Labordiagnostik GmbH, Vienna, Austria; Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

The prevalence rate was higher in those with myelopathy vs. non-myelopathy. We have now extended our observations to a cohort restricted to North America in whom the diagnosis of HTLV myelopathy was rigorously confirmed to also test for reactivity to another HERV-K10 peptide homologous to the HTLV p24 Gag protein. METHODS: Sera from 100 volunteer blood donors (VBD), 53 patients with large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL), 74 subjects with HTLV-1 or 2 infection (58 non-myelopathy and 16 myelopathy) and 83 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were evaluated in ELISA assays using the above peptides. RESULTS: The HTLV myelopathy patients had a statistically significant increased prevalence of antibodies to both HERV-K10 peptides (87.5%) vs. the VBD (0%), LGLL patients (0%), MS patients (4.8%), and the HTLV positive non-myelopathy subjects (5.2%). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that immuno-cross-reactivity to HERV-K10 peptides and/or transactivation of HERV-K10 expression by the HTLV Tax protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and spastic ataxia.","['Perzova, Raisa', 'Graziano, Elliot', 'Sanghi, Swathi', 'Welch, Caitlin', 'Benz, Patricia', 'Abbott, Lynn', 'Lalone, Danielle', 'Glaser, Jordan', 'Loughran, Thomas', 'Sheremata, William', 'Poiesz, Bernard J']","['Perzova R', 'Graziano E', 'Sanghi S', 'Welch C', 'Benz P', 'Abbott L', 'Lalone D', 'Glaser J', 'Loughran T', 'Sheremata W', 'Poiesz BJ']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, State University of New York, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA. poieszb@upstate.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131223,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross Reactions', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/pathology', 'HTLV-II Infections/*complications/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/immunology', 'Humans', 'North America', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/*pathology']",PMC3878045,2013/12/25 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-360 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-360 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Dec 23;10:360. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although transplantation of cryopreserved-thawed ovarian tissue in cancer survivors has resulted in live births, there is evidence of malignancy involvement in ovarian tissue, especially in leukaemia. The objectives of this study were to investigate the involvement of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in ovaries by both pathological/immunohistochemical methods and PCR for the identification of the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL transcripts). The patient was a survivor of paediatric CML whose ovaries were cryopreserved. The patient became infertile and requested ovarian reimplantation in adulthood. Pathological examinations of ovarian tissue with immunohistochemical stainings, quantitative PCR and two-step nested PCR were applied to identify BCR-ABL transcripts. Despite the lack of positive pathological/immunohistochemical evidence, PCR and two-step nested PCR revealed that the ovary was contaminated by malignant minimal residual CML. Survivors of childhood CML may harbour minimal residual disease in the ovaries. This finding stresses the danger of reseeding cancer by ovarian grafting, especially in patients with leukaemia. If ovarian grafting is considered, reimplantation should be preceded by examination of ovarian samples both pathologically and by molecular techniques. On the basis of molecular findings, ovarian autografting was not recommended in this case report.","['Abir, Ronit', 'Aviram, Adina', 'Feinmesser, Meora', 'Stein, Jerry', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Parnes, Doris', 'Ben-Haroush, Avi', 'Meirow, Dror', 'Rabizadeh, Esther', 'Fisch, Benjamin']","['Abir R', 'Aviram A', 'Feinmesser M', 'Stein J', 'Yaniv I', 'Parnes D', 'Ben-Haroush A', 'Meirow D', 'Rabizadeh E', 'Fisch B']","['Infertility and IVF Unit, Beilinson Women Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

At present, much effort is focused on delivery carriers that can increase the intracellular retention and antileukemic impact of IM. We previously validated IM-loaded polyelectrolyte microcapsules as effective purging agents to eradicate BCR-ABL(+) cells from CML patient autografts. The aim is to develop controlled release carriers that can increase the intracellular retention and functionality of IM in leukemia cells. MATERIALS & METHODS: Herein, novel polyelectrolyte complexes were used as model carriers for IM in a CML cell line (KU812) and CD34(+) cells freshly isolated from patients. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Polyelectrolyte complexes promoted a long-acting BCR-ABL kinase inactivation that was necessary to promote apoptosis at approximately twofold lower intracellular IM dose compared with the microscale formulation polyelectrolyte microcapsules. CONCLUSION: IM-loaded polyelectrolyte complexes can be used as more efficient delivery devices for overcoming drug resistance of BCR-ABL(+) leukemic cells.","['Palama, Ilaria E', 'Coluccia, Addolorata M L', 'Gigli, Giuseppe']","['Palama IE', 'Coluccia AM', 'Gigli G']","['National Nanotechnology Laboratory, Institute of Nanoscience National Research Council, Via Arnesano, 73100 Lecce, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131223,England,Nanomedicine (Lond),"Nanomedicine (London, England)",101278111,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Electrolytes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electrolytes/*administration & dosage', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage']",,2013/12/25 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2013/12/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/nnm.13.147 [doi]'],ppublish,Nanomedicine (Lond). 2014 Jul;9(14):2087-98. doi: 10.2217/nnm.13.147.

Although the physiopathology of these diseases is multifactorial, a genetic factor seems to be at play. Several studies worldwide have shown association of ALL and AML with several alleles of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). OBJECTIVE: To determine gene frequencies of HLA-B alleles in Mexicans (individuals with Native American genetic background admixed with European descent) with ALL and AML. METHODS: We compared the HLA-B alleles in 213 patients with ALL and 85 patients with AML to those present in 731 umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples as a control group; this was done by means of the PCR-SSP technique. RESULTS: We found an increased frequency of the HLA-B*40 allele in ALL patients as compared to the control group (14.5% versus 9.84%, P = 0.003, OR = 1.67); this was particularly evident in a subgroup of young (less than 18 years old) ALL patients (P = 0.002, OR = 1.76); likewise, a decreased frequency of HLA-B*40 allele in AML patients was observed as compared to the control group (4.70% versus 9.84%, P = 0.02, OR = 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: These results might suggest opposing effects of the HLA-B*40 in the genetic susceptibility to develop ALL or AML and offer the possibility to study further the molecular mechanisms of cell differentiation within the bone marrow lineage.","['Fernandez-Torres, Javier', 'Flores-Jimenez, Denhi', 'Arroyo-Perez, Antonio', 'Granados, Julio', 'Lopez-Reyes, Alberto']","['Fernandez-Torres J', 'Flores-Jimenez D', 'Arroyo-Perez A', 'Granados J', 'Lopez-Reyes A']","['Laboratorio de Sinovio Analisis Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion, Secretaria de Salud (SSA), Calzada Mexico-Xochimilco Numero 289, Tlalpan, 14389 Mexico, DF, Mexico ; Departamento de Biologia, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Circuito Interior, Ciudad Universitaria, Coyoacan, 04510 Mexico, DF, Mexico.', 'Centro Nacional de la Transfusion Sanguinea, SSA.

It is a well-known fact that CLL is associated with autoimmune cytopenias. CLL cells are CD5(+) B lymphocytes, and usually are not the ""guilty"" cells which produce autoantibodies. T cell defect is another characteristic of CLL and the total number of T cells is increased, and there is inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is the most common autoimmune complication of CLL and has been reported in 10-25% of CLL patients. However, the stage-adjusted estimated rate of AIHA in CLL is about 5%. Conversely, CLL is three times more common in patients who present with AIHA. Direct agglutinin test (DAT) is positive in 7-14% of CLL patients but AIHA may also occur in DAT negative patients. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AIT) is the second most common complication of CLL and has been reported in 2-3% of patients. DAT is positive in AIT but presence of antiplatelet antibodies is neither diagnostic nor reliable. Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) are very rare complications of CLL and like other autoimmune complications of CLL may occur at any clinical stage. It is believed that most case reports of AIN and PRCA in CLL actually belong to large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL). Non-hematologic autoimmune complications of CLL including cold agglutinin disease (CAD), paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), acquired angioedema, and anti-myelin associated globulin are rare. Before starting any treatment, clinicians should distinguish between autoimmune cytopenias and massive bone marrow infiltration since autoimmune complications of CLL are not necessarily equal to advanced disease with poor prognosis. According to IWCLL guideline, steroids are the mainstay of treatment of simple autoimmunity.

However, previous results from different studies were inconsistent. Consequently, we performed a meta-analysis in order to accurately evaluate the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln, Arg194Trp, and Arg280His polymorphisms and leukemia risk. METHODS: Through computerized searching of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane, EBSCO, and OpenGrey databases, and manually searching relevant references, a total of 19 studies with 3387 cases and 6168 controls for Arg399Gln (G>A) polymorphism, 12 studies with 2043 cases and 4550 controls for Arg194Trp (C>T), and 6 studies with 1445 cases and 1905 controls for Arg280His (G>A) were collected to perform meta-analysis and stratified analysis to explore the associations between these variants and leukemia susceptibility. Based on three genetic models, the codominant model, dominant model and recessive model, odds ratios (ORs) as well as their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the association strength between XRCC1 genotypes and leukemia risk. RESULTS: With respect to overall leukemia susceptibility, no association was detected. In stratified analyses by tumor type, Arg399Gln was associated with higher acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk (AA vs. GG, OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.11-2.02; AA+GA vs. GG, OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.02-1.78). Additionally, Arg399Gln, Arg194Trp, and Arg280His may influence the susceptibilities of some leukemia type and race populations. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates these three polymorphisms of XRCC1 do not associate with overall leukemia risks but could be associated with the risks for some specific subgroups.","['Zhang, Haijun', 'Liu, Hang', 'Jiang, Gaofeng']","['Zhang H', 'Liu H', 'Jiang G']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Columbia University School of Social Work, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'School of Public Health, Medical College, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1)', '0 (XRCC1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1']",PMC3868451,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0080687 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-24248 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 25;8(11):e80687. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080687. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This peptide was also presented on HLA-DRB1*15:02, recognized by CD4 T cells. Notably, HBZ-specific CD4 T cell responses were only observed in ATL patients after allogeneic HCT (4 of 9 patients) and not in nontransplanted ATL patients (0 of 10 patients) or in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (0 of 10 carriers). In addition, in one acute-type patient, HBZ-specific CD4 T cell responses were absent in complete remission before HCT, but they became detectable after allogeneic HCT. We surmise that HTLV-1 transmission from mothers to infants through breast milk in early life induces tolerance to HBZ and results in insufficient HBZ-specific T cell responses in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers or ATL patients. In contrast, after allogeneic HCT, the reconstituted immune system from donor-derived cells can recognize virus protein HBZ as foreign, and HBZ-specific immune responses are provoked that contribute to the graft-versus-HTLV-1 effect.","['Narita, Tomoko', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Suzuki, Susumu', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Mori, Fumiko', 'Yamada, Tomiko', 'Ri, Masaki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Miyazaki, Yasuhiko', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Niimi, Akio', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Narita T', 'Ishida T', 'Masaki A', 'Suzuki S', 'Ito A', 'Mori F', 'Yamada T', 'Ri M', 'Kusumoto S', 'Komatsu H', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Niimi A', 'Iida S', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya 467-8601, Japan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Allografts', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asymptomatic Diseases', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Carrier State/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/chemistry/immunology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'HLA-D Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*immunology']",,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1301952 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1301952 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Feb 1;192(3):940-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1301952.

We evaluated the expression of the interleukin 3 (IL-3) receptor alpha subunit (CD123), an established marker of acute myeloid leukemia stem cells, on CML LSPCs and the potential of targeting those cells with the humanized anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody CSL362. Compared with normal donors, CD123 expression was higher in CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells of both chronic phase and blast crisis CML patients, with levels increasing upon disease progression. CSL362 effectively targeted CML LSPCs by selective antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-facilitated lysis of CD123(+) cells and reduced leukemic engraftment in mice. Importantly, not only were healthy donor allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells able to mount an effective CSL362-mediated ADCC response, but so were CML patients' autologous NK cells. In addition, CSL362 also neutralized IL-3-mediated rescue of TKI-induced cell death. Notably, combination of TKI- and CSL362-induced ADCC caused even greater reduction of CML progenitors and further augmented their preferential elimination over normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Thus, our data support the further evaluation of CSL362 therapy in CML.","['Nievergall, Eva', 'Ramshaw, Hayley S', 'Yong, Agnes S M', 'Biondo, Mark', 'Busfield, Samantha J', 'Vairo, Gino', 'Lopez, Angel F', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'White, Deborah L', 'Hiwase, Devendra K']","['Nievergall E', 'Ramshaw HS', 'Yong AS', 'Biondo M', 'Busfield SJ', 'Vairo G', 'Lopez AF', 'Hughes TP', 'White DL', 'Hiwase DK']","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*immunology', 'Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35993-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-475194 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 20;123(8):1218-28. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-475194.

However, it has largely failed to identify transcriptional programs that differ between cancer and corresponding normal cells and has not been efficient in identifying expression changes fundamental to disease etiology. Here we present a method that facilitates the comparison of any cancer sample to its nearest normal cellular counterpart, using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a model. We first generated a gene expression-based landscape of the normal hematopoietic hierarchy, using expression profiles from normal stem/progenitor cells, and next mapped the AML patient samples to this landscape. This allowed us to identify the closest normal counterpart of individual AML samples and determine gene expression changes between cancer and normal. We find the cancer vs normal method (CvN method) to be superior to conventional methods in stratifying AML patients with aberrant karyotype and in identifying common aberrant transcriptional programs with potential importance for AML etiology. Moreover, the CvN method uncovered a novel poor-outcome subtype of normal-karyotype AML, which allowed for the generation of a highly prognostic survival signature. Collectively, our CvN method holds great potential as a tool for the analysis of gene expression profiles of cancer patients.","['Rapin, Nicolas', 'Bagger, Frederik Otzen', 'Jendholm, Johan', 'Mora-Jensen, Helena', 'Krogh, Anders', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Borregaard, Niels', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Winther, Ole', 'Theilgaard-Monch, Kim', 'Porse, Bo T']","['Rapin N', 'Bagger FO', 'Jendholm J', 'Mora-Jensen H', 'Krogh A', 'Kohlmann A', 'Thiede C', 'Borregaard N', 'Bullinger L', 'Winther O', 'Theilgaard-Monch K', 'Porse BT']","['The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/04/05 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36049-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-02-485771 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 6;123(6):894-904. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-02-485771.

AZD1208 inhibited the growth of 5 of 14 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines tested, and sensitivity correlates with Pim-1 expression and STAT5 activation. AZD1208 causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MOLM-16 cells, accompanied by a dose-dependent reduction in phosphorylation of Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death, 4EBP1, p70S6K, and S6, as well as increases in cleaved caspase 3 and p27.

Unlike Bcl2, Mcl1 turns over rapidly, but the physiological significance of its turnover has been unclear. We have gained insight into the roles of Mcl1 turnover in vivo by analyzing mice harboring a modified allele of Mcl1 that serendipitously proved to encode an abnormally stabilized form of Mcl1 due to a 13-aa N-terminal extension. Although the mice developed normally and appeared unremarkable, the homozygous males unexpectedly proved infertile due to defective spermatogenesis, which was evoked by enhanced Mcl1 prosurvival activity. Under unstressed conditions, the modified Mcl1 is present at levels comparable to the native protein, but it is markedly stabilized in cells subjected to stresses, such as protein synthesis inhibition or UV irradiation. Strikingly, the modified Mcl1 allele could genetically complement the loss of Bcl2, because introduction of even a single allele significantly ameliorated the severe polycystic kidney disease and consequent runting caused by Bcl2 loss. Significantly, the development of c-MYC-induced acute myeloid leukemia was also accelerated in mice harboring that Mcl1 allele. Our collective findings reveal that, under certain circumstances, the N terminus of Mcl1 regulates its degradation; that some cell types require degradation of Mcl1 to induce apoptosis; and, most importantly, that rapid turnover of Mcl1 can serve as a tumor-suppressive mechanism.","['Okamoto, Toru', 'Coultas, Leigh', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'van Delft, Mark F', 'Glaser, Stefan P', 'Takiguchi, Megumi', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Bouillet, Philippe', 'Adams, Jerry M', 'Huang, David C S']","['Okamoto T', 'Coultas L', 'Metcalf D', 'van Delft MF', 'Glaser SP', 'Takiguchi M', 'Strasser A', 'Bouillet P', 'Adams JM', 'Huang DC']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Testis/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",PMC3890801,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1321259110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1321259110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 7;111(1):261-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1321259110.

Thus, it is important to early predict leukemia relapse. Recent studies have demonstrated strong correlations of relapse with abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP). However, there is no related research on automated detection of ALIP so far. To this end, we have proposed an ALIP detection method to investigate the relevance with AML relapse. Kernelized fuzzy C-means clustering is applied first to separate the foreground (with cells) and background (without cells). Image repairing is then used to wipe out noises to mark region of interest. Then, image partition is introduced to separate the overlapping cells. After that, a set of features are extracted for the classification. Thereafter, support vector machine is applied to classify precursors. At last, filtering operations are applied to obtain the binary-precursor detection results. Thirty-seven patients with AML are examined. The results show that ALIP is efficiently detected in a high sensitivity and positive predictive value by our proposed method. The investigation also demonstrates the strong correlations of AML relapse with ALIP.","['Huang, Hai-Qing', 'Fang, Xiang-Zhong', 'Shi, Jun', 'Hu, Jie']","['Huang HQ', 'Fang XZ', 'Shi J', 'Hu J']","[""School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131221,United States,Med Biol Eng Comput,Medical & biological engineering & computing,7704869,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/07/11 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11517-013-1122-x [doi]'],ppublish,Med Biol Eng Comput. 2014 Feb;52(2):121-9. doi: 10.1007/s11517-013-1122-x.

A 14 base pair insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs66554220) in the 3'-untranslated region of HLA-G influences mRNA stability and protein expression. The analysis of a cohort of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia confirmed that del/del individuals are characterized by higher levels of surface and soluble HLA-G than subjects with the other two genotypes. In line with its role in immunomodulation, the percentage of regulatory T lymphocytes is higher in del/del patients than in patients with the other genotypes and correlates with the amounts of surface or soluble HLA-G. Furthermore, addition of sHLA-G-rich plasma from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia induces natural killer cell apoptosis and impairs natural killer cell lysis, with effects proportional to the amount of soluble HLA-G added. Lastly, the presence of an HLA-G 14 base pair polymorphism is of prognostic value, with del/del patients showing reduced overall survival, as compared to those with other genotypes. These results suggest that: (i) the HLA-G 14 base pair polymorphism influences the levels of surface and soluble HLA-G expression, and (ii) the over-expression of HLA-G molecules contributes to creating tolerogenic conditions.","['Rizzo, Roberta', 'Audrito, Valentina', 'Vacca, Paola', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Brusa, Davide', 'Stignani, Marina', 'Bortolotti, Daria', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Coscia, Marta', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Rizzo R', 'Audrito V', 'Vacca P', 'Rossi D', 'Brusa D', 'Stignani M', 'Bortolotti D', ""D'Arena G"", 'Coscia M', 'Laurenti L', 'Forconi F', 'Gaidano G', 'Mingari MC', 'Moretta L', 'Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S']",['silvia.deaglio@unito.it or roberta.rizzo@unife.it.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Female', 'Gene Expression', 'HLA-G Antigens/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Escape/*genetics/*immunology']",PMC4008099,2013/12/24 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.095281 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.095281 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 May;99(5):888-96. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.095281.

This article reports the findings of a phase II trial of triapine (105 mg/m(2)/day) followed by fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day) daily for 5 consecutive days in 37 patients with accelerated myeloproliferative neoplasms and secondary acute myeloid leukemia. The overall response rate was 49% (18/37), with a complete remission rate of 24% (9/37). Overall response rates and complete remissions were seen in all disease subsets, including secondary acute myeloid leukemia, in which the overall response rate and complete remission rate were 48% and 33%, respectively.

We here report that Tax is a determining factor for dysregulation of autophagy in HTLV-1-transformed T cells and Tax-immortalized CD4 memory T cells. Tax facilitated autophagic process by activating inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase (IKK) complex, which subsequently recruited an autophagy molecular complex containing Beclin1 and Bif-1 to the lipid raft microdomains. Tax engaged a crosstalk between IKK complex and autophagic molecule complex by directly interacting with both complexes, promoting assembly of LC3+ autophagosomes. Moreover, expression of lipid raft-targeted Bif-1 or Beclin1 was sufficient to induce formation of LC3+ autophagosomes, suggesting that Tax recruitment of autophagic molecules to lipid rafts is a dominant strategy to deregulate autophagy in the context of HTLV-1 transformation of T cells.

Here, effects of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor SCH727965 (dinaciclib) on the IRE1 arm of the UPR were examined in human leukemia and myeloma cells. Exposure of cells to extremely low (e.g., nmol/L) concentrations of SCH727965, a potent inhibitor of CDKs 1/2/5/9, diminished XBP-1s and Grp78 induction by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducers thapsigargin and tunicamycin, while sharply inducing cell death. SCH727965, in contrast to IRE1 RNase inhibitors, inhibited the UPR in association with attenuation of XBP-1s nuclear localization and accumulation rather than transcription, translation, or XBP-1 splicing. Notably, in human leukemia cells, CDK1 and 5 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown diminished Grp78 and XBP-1s upregulation while increasing thapsigargin lethality, arguing for a functional role for CDK1/5 in activation of the cytoprotective IRE1/XBP-1s arm of the UPR. In contrast, CDK9 or 2 inhibitors or shRNA knockdown failed to downregulate XBP-1s or Grp78. Furthermore, IRE1, XBP-1, or Grp78 knockdown significantly increased thapsigargin lethality, as observed with CDK1/5 inhibition/knockdown. Finally, SCH727965 diminished myeloma cell growth in vivo in association with XBP-1s downregulation. Together, these findings demonstrate that SCH727965 acts at extremely low concentrations to attenuate XBP-1s nuclear accumulation and Grp78 upregulation in response to ER stress inducers. They also highlight a link between specific components of the cell-cycle regulatory apparatus (e.g., CDK1/5) and the cytoprotective IRE1/XBP-1s/Grp78 arm of the UPR that may be exploited therapeutically in UPR-driven malignancies.","['Nguyen, Tri K', 'Grant, Steven']","['Nguyen TK', 'Grant S']","['Corresponding Author: Steven Grant, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Room 234, 401 College Street, P.O.

However, to date, TRAIL-receptor agonists have only shown limited therapeutic benefit in clinical trials. This can, most likely, be attributed to the fact that 50% of all cancer cell lines and most primary human cancers are TRAIL resistant. Consequently, future TRAIL-based therapies will require the addition of sensitizing agents that remove crucial blocks in the TRAIL apoptosis pathway. Here, we identify PIK-75, a small molecule inhibitor of the p110alpha isoform of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), as an exceptionally potent TRAIL apoptosis sensitizer. Surprisingly, PI3K inhibition was not responsible for this activity. A kinome-wide in vitro screen revealed that PIK-75 strongly inhibits a panel of 27 kinases in addition to p110alpha. Within this panel, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as responsible for TRAIL resistance of cancer cells. Combination of CDK9 inhibition with TRAIL effectively induced apoptosis even in highly TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. Mechanistically, CDK9 inhibition resulted in downregulation of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFlip) and Mcl-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Concomitant cFlip and Mcl-1 downregulation was required and sufficient for TRAIL sensitization by CDK9 inhibition. When evaluating cancer selectivity of TRAIL combined with SNS-032, the most selective and clinically used inhibitor of CDK9, we found that a panel of mostly TRAIL-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cell lines was readily killed, even at low concentrations of TRAIL. Primary human hepatocytes did not succumb to the same treatment regime, defining a therapeutic window. Importantly, TRAIL in combination with SNS-032 eradicated established, orthotopic lung cancer xenografts in vivo. Based on the high potency of CDK9 inhibition as a cancer cell-selective TRAIL-sensitizing strategy, we envisage the development of new, highly effective cancer therapies.","['Lemke, J', 'von Karstedt, S', 'Abd El Hay, M', 'Conti, A', 'Arce, F', 'Montinaro, A', 'Papenfuss, K', 'El-Bahrawy, M A', 'Walczak, H']","['Lemke J', 'von Karstedt S', 'Abd El Hay M', 'Conti A', 'Arce F', 'Montinaro A', 'Papenfuss K', 'El-Bahrawy MA', 'Walczak H']","['1] Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK [2] Clinic of General and Visceral Surgery, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.', '1] Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK [2] Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, 20133 Milan, Italy.', 'Cancer Immunology Unit, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3921597,2013/12/24 06:00,2015/01/16 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2013179 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.179 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2014 Mar;21(3):491-502. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.179.

These therapies result in a significant degree of immune activation in the patient, which has correlated with greatly increased efficacy but also with notable toxicity. These therapies produce nonphysiologic T-cell activation, which is the hallmark of these new, highly active treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: We and others have noted cytokine activation profiles that correlate with both toxicity and efficacy in patients receiving T-cell engaging therapies. Effector cytokines such as interferon-gamma are elevated, but so are cytokines that are associated with macrophage activation syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6. Although corticosteroids can control some of these toxicities, a targeted approach may produce superior toxicity control without interfering with efficacy. One approach we have developed targets IL-6, a key cytokine in the toxicity response, using the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. SUMMARY: Detailed studies of the T-cell activation produced by these novel therapies has led to more targeted approaches that have the potential to control toxicity while maintaining efficacy.","['Barrett, David M', 'Teachey, David T', 'Grupp, Stephan A']","['Barrett DM', 'Teachey DT', 'Grupp SA']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Child', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC4198063,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/08/26 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000043 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2014 Feb;26(1):43-9. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000043.,,,,,"['P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS607686'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the molecular basis of oncogene addiction remains elusive. Through unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses of CML cells transiently exposed to BCR-ABL TKI, we identified persistent downregulation of growth factor receptor (GF-R) signaling pathways. We then established and validated a tissue-relevant isogenic model of BCR-ABL-mediated addiction, and found evidence for myeloid GF-R signaling pathway rewiring that profoundly and persistently dampens physiologic pathway activation. We demonstrate that eventual restoration of ligand-mediated GF-R pathway activation is insufficient to fully rescue cells from a competing apoptotic fate. In contrast to previous work with BRAF(V600E) in melanoma cells, feedback inhibition following BCR-ABL TKI treatment is markedly prolonged, extending beyond the time required to initiate apoptosis. Mechanistically, BCR-ABL-mediated oncogene addiction is facilitated by persistent high levels of MAP-ERK kinase (MEK)-dependent negative feedback. SIGNIFICANCE: We found that BCR-ABL can confer addiction in vitro by rewiring myeloid GF-R signaling through establishment of MEK-dependent negative feedback. Our findings predict that deeper, more durable responses to targeted agents across a range of malignancies may be facilitated by maintaining negative feedback concurrently with oncoprotein inhibition.","['Asmussen, Jennifer', 'Lasater, Elisabeth A', 'Tajon, Cheryl', 'Oses-Prieto, Juan', 'Jun, Young-Wook', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Burlingame, Alma', 'Craik, Charles S', 'Shah, Neil P']","['Asmussen J', 'Lasater EA', 'Tajon C', 'Oses-Prieto J', 'Jun YW', 'Taylor BS', 'Burlingame A', 'Craik CS', 'Shah NP']","['Departments of 1Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics, 2Chemistry and Chemical Biology, 3Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 4Otolaryngology, and 5Epidemiology and Biostatistics; 6Division of Hematology/Oncology; and 7Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",PMC4248023,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-13-0235 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0235 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2014 Feb;4(2):200-15. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0235.

The role of miR-155 as both a promoter of inflammation and an oncogenic agent provides a clear need for miR-155 itself to be stringently regulated. We therefore investigated the transcriptional regulation of miR-155 in response to the respective pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators LPS and IL-10. Bioinformatic analysis revealed Ets binding sites on the miR-155 promoter, and we found that Ets2 is critical for miR-155 induction by LPS. Truncation and mutational analysis of the miR-155 promoter confirmed the role of the Ets2 binding site proximal to the transcription start site for LPS responsiveness. We observed increased binding of Ets2 to the miR-155 promoter and Ets2 deficient mice displayed decreased induction of miR-155 in response to LPS. IL-10 inhibited the induction of Ets2 mRNA and protein by LPS, thereby decreasing Ets2 function on the pri-155 promoter. We have thus identified Ets2 as a key novel regulator in both the positive and negative control of miR-155 in the inflammatory response.","['Quinn, Susan R', 'Mangan, Niamh E', 'Caffrey, Brian E', 'Gantier, Michael P', 'Williams, Bryan R G', 'Hertzog, Paul J', 'McCoy, Claire E', ""O'Neill, Luke A J""]","['Quinn SR', 'Mangan NE', 'Caffrey BE', 'Gantier MP', 'Williams BR', 'Hertzog PJ', 'McCoy CE', ""O'Neill LA""]","['From the School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (Ets2 protein, mouse)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (IL10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn155 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Response Elements']",PMC3924294,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/04/29 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)44213-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.522730 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Feb 14;289(7):4316-25. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.522730.

Comprehensive characterization of host and viral miRNA will help uncover the molecular mechanisms that underlie the progression of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) latent infection. To investigate the miRNA expression profile of HCMV and host cells during latent infection, we performed deep-sequencing analysis of the small RNAs isolated from HCMV-infected and mock-infected human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. RESULTS: We established a HCMV latent infection cell model using the THP-1 cells. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to sequence small RNA libraries of the HCMV-infected and mock-infected THP-1 and to investigate their small RNA transcriptomes. We found eight miRNAs including miR-US25-1, miR-US25-2-5p and miR-UL112 that were expressed by HCMV during latent infection. The expressions of the host miRNAs were also affected by HCMV latent infection. At least 49 cellular miRNAs were differentially expressed: 39 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated upon HCMV latent infection. The expression of the human miRNA hsa-miR-124-3p was significantly up-regulated in the HCMV latent infection library. In addition, we found 14 cellular novel miRNAs in the HCMV-infected and mock-infected THP-1 libraries. Functional annotation of the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs suggested that the majority of the genes are involved in melanogenesis, pathways in cancer, endocytosis and wnt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The small RNA transcriptomes obtained in this study demonstrate the usefulness of the deep-sequencing combined with bioinformatics approach in understanding of the expression and function of host and viral small RNAs in HCMV latent infection. This approach can also be applied to the study of other kinds of viruses.","['Fu, Miao', 'Gao, Yan', 'Zhou, Qiuju', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Peng, Ying', 'Tian, Kegang', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Zheng, Xiaoqun']","['Fu M', 'Gao Y', 'Zhou Q', 'Zhang Q', 'Peng Y', 'Tian K', 'Wang J', 'Zheng X']","['Department of the Laboratory Medicine, The Second Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Jinhua, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of the Laboratory Medicine, The Second Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of the Laboratory Medicine, The Second Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of the Laboratory Medicine, The Second Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Science, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education, China.', 'Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao, Shandong, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Jinhua, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of the Laboratory Medicine, The Second Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Science, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education, China.

To explore the structure of the antigen-recognition site of a monoclonal antibody against LTC4 (mAbLTC), we previously isolated full-length cDNAs for heavy and light chains of the antibody and prepared a single-chain antibody comprising variable regions of these two chains (scFvLTC). METHODS: We examined whether mAbLTC and scFvLTC neutralized the biological activities of LTC4 and LTD4 by competing their binding to their receptors. RESULTS: mAbLTC and scFvLTC inhibited their binding of LTC4 or LTD4 to CysLT1 receptor (CysLT1R) and CysLT2 receptor (CysLT2R) overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The induction by LTD4 of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 mRNAs in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells expressing CysLT1R was dose-dependently suppressed not only by mAbLTC but also by scFvLTC. LTC4- and LTD4-induced aggregation of mouse platelets expressing CysLT2R was dose-dependently suppressed by either mAbLTC or scFvLTC. Administration of mAbLTC reduced pulmonary eosinophil infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia observed in a murine model of asthma. Furthermore, mAbLTC bound to CysLT2R antagonists but not to CysLT1R antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that mAbLTC and scFvLTC neutralize the biological activities of LTs by competing their binding to CysLT1R and CysLT2R. Furthermore, the binding of cysteinyl LT receptor antagonists to mAbLTC suggests the structural resemblance of the LT-recognition site of the antibody to that of these receptors.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether PJA modulates the allergic inflammatory reaction and to study its possible mechanisms of action using mast cell-based in vitro and in vivo models. The study was performed in anaphylaxis mouse model and cultured mast cells. PJA inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in immunoglobulin E-stimulated mast cells. PJA reduced this expression by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and nuclear factor of activated T cell. The oral administration of PJA reduced systemic and cutaneous anaphylaxis, the release of serum histamine, and the expression of the histamine H1 receptor. In addition, PJA attenuated the activation of mast cells. PJA inhibited the release of histamine from various types of mast cells by the suppression of intracellular calcium.

The algorithm minimizes the divergence between the actual image and the ideally thresholded image to search for the final threshold. A new divergence formula based on exponential intuitionistic fuzzy entropy has been proposed. Further, to increase its noise handling capacity, a neighborhood-based membership function for the image pixels has been designed. The proposed scheme has been applied on 110 normal and 54 leukemia (chronic myelogenous leukemia) affected blood samples. The nucleus segmentation results have been validated by three expert hematologists. The algorithm achieves an average segmentation accuracy of 98.52% in noise-free environment. It beats the competitor algorithms in terms of several other metrics. The proposed scheme with neighborhood based membership function outperforms the competitor algorithms in terms of segmentation accuracy under noisy environment. It achieves 93.90% and 94.93% accuracies for Speckle and Gaussian noises, respectively. The average area under the ROC curves comes out to be 0.9514 in noisy conditions, which proves the robustness of the proposed algorithm.","['Jati, Arindam', 'Singh, Garima', 'Mukherjee, Rashmi', 'Ghosh, Madhumala', 'Konar, Amit', 'Chakraborty, Chandan', 'Nagar, Atulya K']","['Jati A', 'Singh G', 'Mukherjee R', 'Ghosh M', 'Konar A', 'Chakraborty C', 'Nagar AK']","['Department of Electronics &Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Electronics &Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India.', 'School of Medical Science & Technology, IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal, India.', 'School of Medical Science & Technology, IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Electronics &Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India.', 'School of Medical Science & Technology, IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal, India.

METHODS: Glioblastoma cell line GL261 and brain micro-vessel endothelial cell line b.END3 were used. Transwell co-culture system, limit dilution assay, xenograft, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, fluorescence activating cell sorter (FACS) and gene knock-down assay were used to determine the GSC-like phenotype and Bmi1 gene expression in glioma cells. RESULTS: Compared with the control of GL261 cell alone, (1) more and larger tumor spheres formed after co-culturing with endothelial cells (62.5% +/- 1.5% vs 25.0% +/- 4.6% at 40 cells/well, P = 0.000).

As is true of all lymphocytes, natural killer cell malignancies can develop, however natural killer cell leukemias can be very difficult to treat due to their intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. With the recent understanding that statin drugs may have anti-cancer properties, our investigations have focused on the ability of statins to inhibit the growth and cytotoxicity of the YT-INDY natural killer cell leukemia cell line. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that several statin compounds can inhibit YT-INDY proliferation disrupt cell cycle progression and abrogate natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Since natural killer cell leukemia cytotoxicity may play a role in the pulmonary damage seen in these patients, this is an important finding. Cytotoxicity, proliferation and cell cycle progression could be restored by the addition of mevalonate, signifying that the statin effects are brought about through HMG CoA reductase inhibition. The mevalonate pathway intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not other intermediates in the mevalonate pathway, partially reversed statin-induced inhibition of YT-INDY proliferation and cytotoxicity. These results suggest that blockage of products made in the latter part of the mevalonate pathway may account for the observed inhibitory effects on YT-INDY proliferation and cytotoxicity. However, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate could not reverse the statin-induced inhibition of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the statin drugs should be investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for human natural killer cell leukemias possibly in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.","['Crosbie, Jon', 'Magnussen, Marc', 'Dornbier, Ryan', 'Iannone, Alexandra', 'Steele, Timothy A']","['Crosbie J', 'Magnussen M', 'Dornbier R', 'Iannone A', 'Steele TA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Des Moines University, 3200 Grand Ave,, 50312 Des Moines, Iowa, USA. timothy.steele@dmu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131220,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC3878130,2013/12/24 06:00,2013/12/24 06:01,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:01 [medline]']","['2050-7771-1-33 [pii]', '10.1186/2050-7771-1-33 [doi]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2013 Dec 20;1(1):33. doi: 10.1186/2050-7771-1-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate novel mechanisms of Znf179 regulation and function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Znf179-interacting proteins. RESULTS: Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf) as a specific interacting protein of Znf179. Further analysis showed that the region containing the first two zinc fingers of Plzf is critical for its interaction with Znf179. Although the transcriptional regulatory activity of Plzf was not affected by Znf179 in the Gal4-dependent transcription assay system, the cellular localization of Znf179 was changed from cytoplasm to nucleus when Plzf was co-expressed. We also found that Znf179 interacted with Plzf and regulated Plzf protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that Znf179 interacted with Plzf, resulting in its translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus and increase of Plzf protein abundance. Although the precise nature and role of the Znf179-Plzf interaction remain to be elucidated, both of these two genes are involved in the regulation of neurogenesis. Our finding provides further research direction for studying the molecular functions of Znf179.","['Lin, Ding-Yen', 'Huang, Chi-Chen', 'Hsieh, Ya-Ting', 'Lin, Hsin-Chuan', 'Pao, Ping-Chieh', 'Tsou, Jen-Hui', 'Lai, Chien-Ying', 'Hung, Liang-Yi', 'Wang, Ju-Ming', 'Chang, Wen-Chang', 'Lee, Yi-Chao']","['Lin DY', 'Huang CC', 'Hsieh YT', 'Lin HC', 'Pao PC', 'Tsou JH', 'Lai CY', 'Hung LY', 'Wang JM', 'Chang WC', 'Lee YC']","['Ph,D, Program for Neural Regenerative Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan. yclee@tmu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131220,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RING finger protein 112, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC3878200,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/07/10 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-20-98 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-20-98 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2013 Dec 20;20:98. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-20-98.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is encoded by minus strand of provirus, is expressed in all ATL cases and supports the proliferation of ATL cells. However, the precise mechanism of growth promoting activity of HBZ is poorly understood. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that HBZ suppressed C/EBPalpha signaling activation induced by either Tax or C/EBPalpha. As mechanisms of HBZ-mediated C/EBPalpha inhibition, we found that HBZ physically interacted with C/EBPalpha and diminished its DNA binding capacity. Luciferase and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HBZ repressed C/EBPalpha activation in a Smad3-dependent manner. In addition, C/EBPalpha was overexpressed in HTLV-1 infected cell lines and fresh ATL cases. HBZ was able to induce C/EBPalpha transcription by enhancing its promoter activity. Finally, HBZ selectively modulated the expression of C/EBPalpha target genes, leading to the impairment of C/EBPalpha-mediated cell growth suppression. CONCLUSION: HBZ, by suppressing C/EBPalpha signaling, supports the proliferation of HTLV-1 infected cells, which is thought to be critical for oncogenesis.","['Zhao, Tiejun', 'Coutts, Aaron', 'Xu, Lingling', 'Yu, Juntao', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Zhao T', 'Coutts A', 'Xu L', 'Yu J', 'Ohshima K', 'Matsuoka M']","['College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, Zhejiang 321004, China. tjzhao@zjnu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131221,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Female', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3880043,2013/12/24 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-159 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-159 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Dec 21;10:159. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In U937 cells, AICAR alone induces the expression of cell surface markers associated with mature monocytes and macrophages. In both cell lines, AICAR increases the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the presence of a MAPK inhibitor reduces the expression of differentiation markers.

After osteogenic differentiation, expression levels of the transcription factor zinc factor and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) were significantly increased. ZBTB16 is associated with the process of osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and crucial for the expression of the osteogenic transcription factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). It is proposed that ZBTB16 plays also a crucial role for the differentiation of DFCs into osteoblasts. METHODS: In this study, the differentiation of DFCs by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity measurement, alizarin red staining, and electron-dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX) analysis is investigated. The expression of ZBTB16 during osteogenic differentiation and the expression of osteogenic differentiation markers were assessed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Glucocorticoid stimulation was inhibited using RU486 (11beta-[p-(Dimethylamino)phenyl]-17beta-hydroxy-17-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3- one), and ZBTB16 was overexpressed via transient transfection of an expression vector. RESULTS: After the initiation of osteogenic differentiation, ZBTB16 levels were increased highly in DFCs, whereas RUNX2 was expressed constitutively only. An EDX analysis verified the differentiation of DFCs into osteoblast-like cells because clusters of mineralization consisted of hydroxyapatite. ZBTB16 induced the expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3; osteocalcin; and stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) but not of RUNX2 and ALP in DFCs. STC1 was upregulated in DFCs downstream of ZBTB16 and after the osteogenic differentiation. The overexpression of STC1 in DFCs increased the expression of ZBTB16 and specific markers for biomineralization. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that ZBTB16 induced the expression of osteogenic differentiation markers independently of RUNX2. Moreover, STC1 is a new candidate for the evaluation of late mechanisms of osteogenic differentiation downstream of ZBTB16.","['Felthaus, Oliver', 'Gosau, Martin', 'Morsczeck, Christian']","['Felthaus O', 'Gosau M', 'Morsczeck C']","['Department of Cranio- and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131222,United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NR4A3 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RUNX2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '60MEW57T9G (alizarin)', '76687-96-2 (teleocalcin)', '91D9GV0Z28 (Durapatite)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Anthraquinones', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Calcification, Physiologic/genetics', 'Calcium/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Coloring Agents', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dental Sac/*cytology/metabolism', 'Durapatite/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Hormone Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/*physiology', 'Osteocalcin/genetics', 'Osteogenesis/*genetics', 'Phosphorus/analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Transfection']",,2013/12/24 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2013/12/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1902/jop.2013.130445 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontol. 2014 May;85(5):e144-51. doi: 10.1902/jop.2013.130445.

Progressive shortness of breath for two weeks, cough, clear sputum and weight loss were the initial complaints. Serum dyscrasia suggested a hematologic abnormality. A chest x-ray performed demonstrated a buildup of fluid with layering in the left pleural cavity. Diagnostic thoracentesis suggested an exudative etiology with cytology remarkable for 62% leukemic myeloblast. The diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy with expression of the antigens CD 34+ and CD13+, with unfavorable cytogenetic prognosis and a trisomy 21 chromosomal defect.

Thus these applications in biomedical research and clinical medicine create a high demand for bioactive hLIF. However, production of active hLIF is problematic since eukaryotic cells demonstrate limited expression and prokaryotic cells produce insoluble protein. Here, we have adopted a hybrid protein disulfide isomerase design to increase the solubility of hLIF in Escherichia coli. Low temperature expression of hLIF fused to the b'a' domain of protein disulfide isomerase (PDIb'a') increased the soluble expression in comparison to controls. A simple purification protocol for bioactive hLIF was established that includes removal of the PDIb'a' domain by cleavage by TEV protease. The resulting hLIF, which contains one extra glycine residue at the N-terminus, was highly pure and demonstrated endotoxin levels below 0.05 EU/mug. The presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond was identified using mass spectroscopy. This purified hLIF effectively maintained the pluripotency of a murine embryonic stem cell line. Thus we have developed an effective method to produce a pure bioactive version of hLIF in E. coli for use in biomedical research.","['Song, Jung-A', 'Koo, Bon-Kyung', 'Chong, Seon-Ha', 'Kim, Kyunhoo', 'Choi, Dong Kyu', 'Thi Vu, Thu Trang', 'Nguyen, Minh Tan', 'Jeong, Boram', 'Ryu, Han-Bong', 'Kim, Injune', 'Jang, Yeon Jin', 'Robinson, Robert Charles', 'Choe, Han']","['Song JA', 'Koo BK', 'Chong SH', 'Kim K', 'Choi DK', 'Thi Vu TT', 'Nguyen MT', 'Jeong B', 'Ryu HB', 'Kim I', 'Jang YJ', 'Robinson RC', 'Choe H']","['Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Biopolis, Singapore, Singapore ; Department of Biochemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Physiology and Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131216,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Solubility']",PMC3865251,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/09/17 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0083781 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-25620 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 16;8(12):e83781. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0083781. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,"['PLoS One. 2014;9(1). doi:10.1371/annotation/4b2acdb5-5bab-4bca-8fbc-f9f293b38ee0.', 'Jung, A Song [corrected to Song, Jung-A]']",,,,,,

In this study, we have shown that selenite can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NB4 cells. Selenite treatment of these cells also inhibited the JNK/ATF2 axis. Further experiments demonstrated that selenite-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) worked as an upstream of the JNK/ATF2 axis, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Inactivation of ATF2 resulted in decreased affinity of this transcription factor for the promoters of cyclin A, cyclin D3 and CDK4, which led to the arrest of the NB4 cells in the G0/G1 phase.

Three petroleum case-control studies identified 60 cases (241 matched controls) for AML and 80 cases (345 matched controls) for chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL). METHODS: Cases were classified and scored regarding uncertainty by two haematologists using available diagnostic information. Blinded quantitative benzene exposure assessment used work histories and exposure measurements adjusted for era-specific circumstances. Statistical analyses included conditional logistic regression and penalised smoothing splines. RESULTS: Benzene exposures were much lower than previous studies. Categorical analyses showed increased ORs for AML with several exposure metrics, although patterns were unclear; neither continuous exposure metrics nor spline analyses gave increased risks. ORs were highest in terminal workers, particularly for Tanker Drivers. No relationship was found between benzene exposure and risk of CLL, although the Australian study showed increased risks in refinery workers. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study does not persuasively demonstrate a risk between benzene and AML. A previously reported strong relationship between myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (potentially previously reported as AML) at our study's low benzene levels suggests that MDS may be the more relevant health risk for lower exposure. Higher CLL risks in refinery workers may be due to more diverse exposures than benzene alone.","['Rushton, L', 'Schnatter, A R', 'Tang, G', 'Glass, D C']","['Rushton L', 'Schnatter AR', 'Tang G', 'Glass DC']","[""Imperial College London, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, St Mary's Campus, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK."", 'ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Occupational and Public Health Division, 1545 US Highway 22 East, Annandale, NJ 08801 3059, USA.', 'University of Pittsburgh, Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, 130 DeSoto Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.', 'Monash University, Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing & Health Sciences, The Alfred Hospital, 89 Commercial Road, Melbourne Victoria 3004, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Australia', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Logistic Models', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Petroleum/toxicity', 'Risk Factors']",PMC3915135,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013780 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.780 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2014 Feb 4;110(3):783-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.780.

We hypothesized that marrow-infiltrating immune populations play a critical role in response to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), an established and potentially curative immune therapy whose precise mechanism remains unknown. We therefore analyzed marrow-infiltrating immune populations in 29 patients (22 responders, 7 nonresponders) with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia who received CD4(+) DLI in the pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor era. Immunohistochemical analysis of pretreatment marrow revealed that the presence of >4% marrow-infiltrating CD8(+) (but not CD4(+)) T cells predicted DLI response, even in the setting of high leukemia burden. Furthermore, mRNA expression profiling of marrow-infiltrating T cells of a subset of responders compared with nonresponders revealed enrichment of T-cell exhaustion-specific genes in pretreatment T cells of DLI responders and significant downregulation of gene components in the same pathway in responders in conjunction with clinical response. Our data demonstrate that response to DLI is associated with quantity of preexisting marrow CD8(+) T cells and local reversal of T-cell exhaustion. Our studies implicate T-cell exhaustion as a therapeutic target of DLI and support the potential use of novel anti-PD1/PDL1 agents in lieu of DLI.","['Bachireddy, Pavan', 'Hainz, Ursula', 'Rooney, Michael', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Aldridge, Julie', 'Zhang, Wandi', 'Liao, Xiaoyun', 'Hodi, F Stephen', ""O'Connell, Karyn"", 'Haining, W Nicholas', 'Goldstein, Natalie R', 'Canning, Christine M', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Alyea, Edwin P 3rd', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Bachireddy P', 'Hainz U', 'Rooney M', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Aldridge J', 'Zhang W', 'Liao X', 'Hodi FS', ""O'Connell K"", 'Haining WN', 'Goldstein NR', 'Canning CM', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ritz J', 'Hacohen N', 'Alyea EP 3rd', 'Kim HT', 'Wu CJ']",['Department of Medical Oncology and.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Blood Donors', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Transcriptome', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden']",PMC3938152,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35965-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-08-523001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 27;123(9):1412-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-08-523001.

Genetic BTK deletion causes B-cell immunodeficiency in humans and mice, making this kinase an attractive therapeutic target for B-cell disorders. The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (PCI-32765, brand name: Imbruvica) demonstrated high clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, especially in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Therefore, ibrutinib was granted a 'breakthrough therapy' designation for these indications and was recently approved for the treatment of relapsed MCL by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Other BTK inhibitors in earlier clinical development include CC-292 (AVL-292), and ONO-4059. In CLL and MCL, ibrutinib characteristically induces redistribution of malignant B cells from tissue sites into the peripheral blood, along with rapid resolution of enlarged lymph nodes and a surge in lymphocytosis. With continuous ibrutinib therapy, growth- and survival-inhibitory activities of ibrutinib result in the normalization of lymphocyte counts and remissions in a majority of patients.

MDS had been an intractable disease for which the mainstream of therapeutic approach was best supportive care. Recently, however, treatment of hematological malignancies has benefited from advances in molecular targeted drug discovery such as the revolutionary drug imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia, and from the reappraisal of forgotten drugs such as thalidomide for multiple myeloma. Two azanucleotide drugs, azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine, were created as anti-neoplastic drugs in the 1960s with little success. In the 1980s, they were reassessed as hypomethylating agents (HMAs), and the introduction of low-dose schedules of them has shown dramatic effects in the delay of leukemic evolution for high-risk MDS. AZA was approved in Japan in March 2011 and has become a standard drug of choice in the treatment of high-risk MDS. Its position as a treatment for low-risk MDS remains to be established. Only half of patients with high-risk MDS can gain benefit from AZA. For example, those with complex karyotypes experience only a limited extension in survival. In addition, AZA resistance develops sooner or later. To achieve a more sustained disease control of high-risk MDS, the combined use of HMAs with other therapeutic approaches will be inevitable. Clinical trials of histone deacetylase inhibitors, lenalidomide, thrombopoietin agonists, or anticancer drugs in combination with HMAs are ongoing. In addition, HMAs are being used as a bridging therapy prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) and the salvage therapy of relapsed disease after AHSCT. Thus, HMAs will continue to be key drugs for the management of MDS.","['Ishikawa, Takayuki']",['Ishikawa T'],"['Department of Hematology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, 2-1-1 Minatojima-Minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan, ishikawa@kcho.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131220,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Lenalidomide', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/10/16 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10147-013-0651-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2014 Feb;19(1):10-5. doi: 10.1007/s10147-013-0651-5.

Particularly, digital gene expression (DGE) technologies produce a large dynamic range of expression data by generating short tag signatures for each cell transcript. These tags can be mapped back to a reference genome to identify new transcribed regions that can be further covered by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) reads. Here, we applied an integrated bioinformatics approach that combines DGE tags, RNA-Seq, tiling array expression data and species-comparison to explore new transcriptional regions and their specific biological features, particularly tissue expression or conservation. We analysed tags from a large DGE data set (designated as 'TranscriRef'). We then annotated 750,000 tags that were uniquely mapped to the human genome according to Ensembl. We retained transcripts originating from both DNA strands and categorized tags corresponding to protein-coding genes, antisense, intronic- or intergenic-transcribed regions and computed their overlap with annotated non-coding transcripts. Using this bioinformatics approach, we identified approximately 34,000 novel transcribed regions located outside the boundaries of known protein-coding genes. As demonstrated using sequencing data from human pluripotent stem cells for biological validation, the method could be easily applied for the selection of tissue-specific candidate transcripts.

Our results demonstrate that etv7 regulates the expression of the zebrafish lanosterol synthase (lss) gene, an essential gene in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Furthermore, morpholino knockdown of etv7 leads to loss of hemoglobin-containing red blood cells, a phenotype that can be rescued by injection of exogenous cholesterol. We conclude that etv7 is essential for normal red blood cell development through regulation of the lss gene and the cholesterol synthesis pathway.","['Quintana, Anita M', 'Picchione, Fabrizio', 'Klein Geltink, Ramon I', 'Taylor, Michael R', 'Grosveld, Gerard C']","['Quintana AM', 'Picchione F', 'Klein Geltink RI', 'Taylor MR', 'Grosveld GC']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Genetics, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,"['0 (ETV7 protein, human)', '0 (ETV7 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Morpholinos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Biosynthetic Pathways/drug effects/genetics', 'Cholesterol/*biosynthesis', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Morpholinos/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta-Globins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3917247,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['dmm.012526 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.012526 [doi]']",ppublish,Dis Model Mech. 2014 Feb;7(2):265-70. doi: 10.1242/dmm.012526.

The present study aimed at evaluating the current need of exercise interventions in pediatric cancer patients undergoing acute treatment and identifying risk factors for inactivity. PROCEDURE: Data about self-reported physical activity before and during treatment was collected in a cross-sectional design with the physical activity questionnaire from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) in a modified cancer specific version. RESULTS: One hundred thirty pediatric cancer patients with various entities were questioned 3.0 +/- 1.6 months since diagnosis. Patients' activity levels before diagnosis mainly matched reference values for healthy children in Germany. Reductions during treatment affected all dimensions of daily physical activities and minutes of exercise per week decreased significantly (P < 0.001). Largest reductions of physical activities during treatment were identified for bone tumor patients and in-patient stays. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the well known importance of physical activity during childhood and the identified risk of inactivity during cancer treatment, supervised exercise interventions should be implemented into acute treatment phase to enhance activity levels and ensure a continuously support by qualified exercise professionals.","['Gotte, Miriam', 'Kesting, Sabine', 'Winter, Corinna', 'Rosenbaum, Dieter', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Gotte M', 'Kesting S', 'Winter C', 'Rosenbaum D', 'Boos J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Behavior', 'Bone Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Child', '*Child Behavior', 'Child, Hospitalized', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', '*Leisure Activities', 'Leukemia/prevention & control/therapy', 'Male', '*Motor Activity', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', 'Physical Fitness', 'Play and Playthings', 'Sedentary Behavior', 'Self Report', 'Sports', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Walking']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24898 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jun;61(6):1023-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24898.

During this time, our institution substituted mitoxantrone 6.25 mg/m(2) for daunorubicin 25 mg/m(2) on induction Days 1, 8, 15, and 22. While mitoxantrone has been shown to be effective for relapsed ALL, it has not been studied in de novo pediatric ALL/LLy. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with ALL or LLy at our institution 1/2009-4/2013 to compare induction toxicity and response of patients treated with mitoxantrone versus daunorubicin. RESULTS: Eleven patients received mitoxantrone, 121 patients received daunorubicin. Induction toxicities including deaths, intensive care unit admissions, fever, bacteremia, and invasive fungal disease were similar for the two groups. Mean number of days hospitalized during induction was also similar (mitoxantrone 9.7 days vs. daunorubicin 11.2 days, P = 0.60). Minimal residual disease prevalence at the end of induction was not significantly different (mitoxantrone 33.3% vs. daunorubicin 23.0%, P = 0.44). The only significant difference between the groups was that a higher proportion of patients who received mitoxantrone had consolidation delayed due to myelosuppression (mitoxantrone 30.0% vs. daunorubicin 6.0%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Induction toxicity and response for new ALL/LLy patients treated with mitoxantrone in place of daunorubicin were similar to the toxicity and response seen with conventional daunorubicin. Mitoxantrone is a reasonable replacement for daunorubicin in times of drug shortage.","['Nickel, Robert S', 'Keller, Frank', 'Bergsagel, John', 'Cooper, Todd', 'Daves, Marla', 'Sabnis, Himalee', 'Lew, Glen']","['Nickel RS', 'Keller F', 'Bergsagel J', 'Cooper T', 'Daves M', 'Sabnis H', 'Lew G']","[""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131219,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Drug Substitution', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",PMC4317248,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24892 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):810-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24892.

Population-based comparisons and time trends are complicated by inconsistent definitions and classifications. In the course of the European HAEMACARE project, a consensus grouping system was created based on the morphology codes of the ICD-O-3 (International Classification of Diseases-Oncology, third revision), consistent with the WHO classification published in 2008 and useful for epidemiologic and public health purposes. For the first time leukemia incidence and survival in Germany are presented according to this system on the basis of cancer registry data.. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A set of leukemia cases diagnosed during 2001-2010 was extracted from the data submitted by German population-based cancer registries to the Robert Koch Institute in early 2013 and grouped according to the HAEMACARE system. Direct age-standardized incidence rates were calculated. To estimate the prognosis of adult leukemia patients diagnosed during 2008-2010, the 5-year relative survival was computed using the period approach. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Based on 23,328 predominantly leukemic malignancies ascertained for six federal states over a 10-year period, the age-standardized incidence rates were 4.1 (per 100,000) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 3.1 for acute myeloid leukemia, and 2.4 for myeloproliferative neoplasms, similar to other European regions. The 5-year relative survival of leukemia in Germany currently ranges between 8 and 95% according to sex, age, and category, and is thus considerably better compared with results derived from a European data pool referring to 2000-2002.","['Nennecke, A', 'Wienecke, A', 'Kraywinkel, K']","['Nennecke A', 'Wienecke A', 'Kraywinkel K']","['Hamburgisches Krebsregister, Behorde fur Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz (BGV), Billstr. 80, 20539, Hamburg, Deutschland, Alice.Nennecke@bgv.hamburg.de.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz",101181368,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'International Classification of Diseases/*standards', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*standards', 'Middle Aged', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', '*Proportional Hazards Models', '*Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00103-013-1869-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz. 2014 Jan;57(1):93-102. doi: 10.1007/s00103-013-1869-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Inzidenz und Uberleben bei Leukamien in Deutschland nach aktuellen standardisierten Kategorien.,,,,,

In 2010, the Cancer Registry of Lower Saxony reported on a spatial leukemia accumulation in the community of Asse. As a result, the Cancer Registry was engaged in developing an approach for a regional cancer monitoring program by the federal government. The modular approach involves a two-stage process. First, all regional monitoring areas are under surveillance, and in the second phase, noticeable areas only are observed further. A positive confirmation test is regarded as an initial concern and may lead to further investigations. METHODS: The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) is used in the first stage. For confirmation, the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is applied in the second stage. All new observations are tested at a given time. The SPRT tests the null hypothesis (no increase) and an alternative hypothesis (increase) leading to three possible conclusions: warning, all-clear, or further surveillance necessary. RESULTS: A high false alarm rate due to clustering by chance is to be considered with multiple statistical testing. The number of false alarms depends on the number of tested areas, diagnoses, subgroup analyses, and time periods. Preliminary considerations comprise 400 spatial areas, three diagnosis groups, no subgroup analyses, and a biannual first-stage testing. Guidelines for the level of significance and for detecting an increase in incidence will be necessary for the assessment of the monitoring parameters. DISCUSSION: Before running the monitoring program, a number of questions have to handled politically; e.g., how many false alarms can be handled, the impact on the population involved, and existing risk communication structures.","['Kieschke, J', 'Hoopmann, M']","['Kieschke J', 'Hoopmann M']","['Epidemiologisches Krebsregister Niedersachsen, Registerstelle, Industriestr. 9, 26121, Oldenburg, Deutschland, kieschke@krebsregister-niedersachsen.de.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz",101181368,,IM,"['Cluster Analysis', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Spatio-Temporal Analysis']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00103-013-1872-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz. 2014 Jan;57(1):33-40. doi: 10.1007/s00103-013-1872-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aktives Monitoring kleinraumiger Krebshaufungen : Vorstellung eines neuen Monitoringkonzeptes fur das Epidemiologische Krebsregister Niedersachsen.,,,,,

The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serine/threonine kinases involved in the regulation of various cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a key role in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the differentiation of the HL-60 human leukemic cells induced by N. chinensis extract. Treatment with N. chinensis extract resulted in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes. The activation of p38 MAPK was also observed 24 h after treatment; however, the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was unaffected. Treatment with an inhibitor of ERK (PD98059) blocked the nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) reducing activity and CD11b expression in the N. chinensis-treated HL-60 cells, whereas treatment with an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580) had no significant effect on NBT reducing activity and CD11b expression. In addition, N. chinensis extract increased PKC activity and the protein levels of PKCalpha, PKCbetaI and PKCbetaII isoforms, without a significant change in the protein levels of the PKCgamma isoform. PKC inhibitors (GF 109203X, chelerythrine and H-7) inhibited the differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes, as well as ERK activation in the N. chinensis-treated HL-60 cells. These results indicate that the PKC and ERK signaling pathways may be involved in the induction, by N. chinensis extract, of the differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes.","['Ju, Sung-Min', 'Kang, Jun-Gue', 'Pae, Hyun-Ock', 'Lee, Guem-San', 'Kim, Won-Sin', 'Lyu, Yeoung-Su', 'Jeon, Byung-Hun']","['Ju SM', 'Kang JG', 'Pae HO', 'Lee GS', 'Kim WS', 'Lyu YS', 'Jeon BH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 570-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 570-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 570-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Herbology, College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 570-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science, College of Natural Sciences, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 570-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 570-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 570-749, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Nardostachys/chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C/*biosynthesis']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2013.1596 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2014 Mar;33(3):573-80. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2013.1596.

However, mechanisms underlying the UVB-induced anti-survival and pro-apoptotic effects on human skin cells remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of UVB radiation on survival and apoptosis of HaCaT human keratinocytes and determined possible molecular, cellular and signaling mechanisms including cross-regulation, which are responsible for the UVB's anti-survival and/or pro-apoptotic effects. The results showed that UVB radiation at 400 mJ/cm(2) for 8 h largely decreased cell survival and induced DNA fragmentation, an index of apoptosis, in HaCaT human keratinocytes. On a mechanistic level, UVB radiation triggered the activation of caspase-9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), human inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (HIAP-1), X-linked IAP (XIAP), and protein kinase B (PKB), but did not affect the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 in HaCaT cells. UVB radiation also upregulated the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker, in HaCaT cells. Of note, results of pharmacological inhibition studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor strongly attenuated UVB-induced apoptosis, the activation of caspase-9, downregulation of Mcl-1, XIAP and PKB (but not HIAP-1), and upregulation of GRP78, while pretreatment with GF109203 or GO6983, pan-PKC inhibitors, substantially blocked the UVB-induced reduction of cell survival, activation of caspase-9, downregulation of HIAP-1, XIAP, and PKB (but not Mcl-1), and GRP78 upregulation in HaCaT cells. Collectively, these results demonstrated that UVB has strong anti-survival and pro-apoptotic effects on HaCaT cells and the effects were largely mediated via the activation of caspase-9 and protein kinase Cs, which subsequently downregulated PKB, XIAP, HIAP-1 and Mcl-1, and triggered ER stress.","['Park, Yu-Kyoung', 'Jang, Byeong-Churl']","['Park YK', 'Jang BC']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131219,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspase 9/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Keratinocytes/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2013.1595 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2014 Mar;33(3):695-702. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2013.1595.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with CLL who were referred for evaluation of alloSCT within a 7-year time frame and had a donor search indication according to the EBMT criteria or because of Richter's transformation were included. Patients for whom a matched donor could be found within 3 months (matches) were compared with patients without such a donor (controls). Primary end point was overall survival measured from the 3-month landmark after search initiation. RESULTS: Of 105 patients with donor search, 97 (matches 83; controls 14) were assessable at the 3-month landmark. Matches and controls were comparable for age, gender, time from diagnosis, number of previous regimens, and remission status. Disregarding if alloSCT was actually carried out or not, survival from the 3-month landmark was significantly better in matches versus controls [hazard ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.85; P = 0.014]. The survival benefit of matches remained significant on multivariate analysis.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the role of demethylation of miR-9-3 and miR-193a genes in regulating proliferation and apoptosis in NSCLCs, and to decipher the potential mechanisms underlying the properties. METHODS: MTT and population doubling time by flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and caspase-3 activity assay were employed to evaluate apoptosis. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot were used to quantify gene expression at mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Methylation-specific PCR was utilized to assess methylation status. RESULTS: We found that demethylation agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzaC) reduced cell numbers and prolonged population doubling time (PDT), and promoted doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in seven NSCLC cell lines with different methylation statuses on miR-9-3 and miR-193a promoter regions: NCI-H1993/NCI-H1915 (miR-9-3(+)/miR-193a(+)), NCI-H1975/NCI-H200 (miR-9-3(+)/miR-193a(-)), A427/NCI-H2073 (miR-9-3(-)/miR-193a(+)), and NCI-H1703 (miR-9-3(-)/miR-193a(-)). Treatment with 5-AzaC concomitantly upregulated expression of miR-9-3 and miR-193a, and downregulated their respective target genes NF-kappaB and Mcl-1. The effects of 5-AzaC were abolished by concomitant knockdown of miR-9-3 and miR-193a using the complex antisense technique, whereas forced ectopic expression of miR-9-3 and miR-193a mimicked the effects of 5-AzaC. We further observed that the strength of proliferation inhibition and apoptosis promotion elicited by 5-AzaC was in the order of NCI-H1993/NCI-H1915 > A427/NCI-H2073 > NCI-H1975/NCI-H200 > NCI-H1703. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation-silencing of miR-9-3 and miR-193a may be an important epigenetic mechanisms favoring NSCLC cell growth and survival for carcinogenesis and cancer progression, and demethylation to reactivate expression of miR-9-3 and miR-193a genes contributes, at least partially, to the anti-cancer properties of 5-AzaC and thereby may be worthy of future studies for the possibility of being a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human NSCLCs.","['Wang, Jinliang', 'Yang, Bo', 'Han, Lu', 'Li, Xiaoyan', 'Tao, Haitao', 'Zhang, Sujie', 'Hu, Yi']","['Wang J', 'Yang B', 'Han L', 'Li X', 'Tao H', 'Zhang S', 'Hu Y']","['Department of General Oncology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131213,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN193 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Up-Regulation']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/08/30 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['000356605 [pii]', '10.1159/000356605 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2013;32(6):1707-19. doi: 10.1159/000356605.

We used 450k arrays and next-generation sequencing to evaluate intratumor heterogeneity and evolution of DNA methylation and genetic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL cases exhibit vast interpatient differences in intratumor methylation heterogeneity, with genetically clonal cases maintaining low methylation heterogeneity and up to 10% of total CpGs in a monoallelically methylated state. Increasing methylation heterogeneity correlates with advanced genetic subclonal complexity. Selection of novel DNA methylation patterns is observed only in cases that undergo genetic evolution, and independent genetic evolution is uncommon and is restricted to low-risk alterations.

In patients lacking a pCR, NAC selects a subpopulation of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells. To understand the molecular underpinnings driving treatment-resistant TNBCs, we performed comprehensive molecular analyses on the residual disease of 74 clinically defined TNBCs after NAC, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 20 matched pretreatment biopsies. Combined NGS and digital RNA expression analysis identified diverse molecular lesions and pathway activation in drug-resistant tumor cells. Ninety percent of the tumors contained a genetic alteration potentially treatable with a currently available targeted therapy. Thus, profiling residual TNBCs after NAC identifies targetable molecular lesions in the chemotherapy-resistant component of the tumor, which may mirror micrometastases destined to recur clinically. These data can guide biomarker-driven adjuvant studies targeting these micrometastases to improve the outcome of patients with TNBC who do not respond completely to NAC. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the spectrum of genomic alterations present in residual TNBC after NAC. Because TNBCs that do not achieve a CR after NAC are likely to recur as metastatic disease at variable times after surgery, these alterations may guide the selection of targeted therapies immediately after mastectomy before these metastases become evident.","['Balko, Justin M', 'Giltnane, Jennifer M', 'Wang, Kai', 'Schwarz, Luis J', 'Young, Christian D', 'Cook, Rebecca S', 'Owens, Phillip', 'Sanders, Melinda E', 'Kuba, Maria G', 'Sanchez, Violeta', 'Kurupi, Richard', 'Moore, Preston D', 'Pinto, Joseph A', 'Doimi, Franco D', 'Gomez, Henry', 'Horiuchi, Dai', 'Goga, Andrei', 'Lehmann, Brian D', 'Bauer, Joshua A', 'Pietenpol, Jennifer A', 'Ross, Jeffrey S', 'Palmer, Gary A', 'Yelensky, Roman', 'Cronin, Maureen', 'Miller, Vincent A', 'Stephens, Phillip J', 'Arteaga, Carlos L']","['Balko JM', 'Giltnane JM', 'Wang K', 'Schwarz LJ', 'Young CD', 'Cook RS', 'Owens P', 'Sanders ME', 'Kuba MG', 'Sanchez V', 'Kurupi R', 'Moore PD', 'Pinto JA', 'Doimi FD', 'Gomez H', 'Horiuchi D', 'Goga A', 'Lehmann BD', 'Bauer JA', 'Pietenpol JA', 'Ross JS', 'Palmer GA', 'Yelensky R', 'Cronin M', 'Miller VA', 'Stephens PJ', 'Arteaga CL']","['Departments of 1Medicine, 2Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, 3Cancer Biology, and 4Biochemistry; 5Breast Cancer Research Program, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee; Departments of 6Cell & Tissue Biology and 7Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; 8Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, Massachusetts; 9Oncosalud; and 10Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN), Lima, Peru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20131219,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/*pathology']",PMC3946308,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-13-0286 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0286 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2014 Feb;4(2):232-45. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0286.

Recently, it has been reported that IL-15-activated CIK cells are superior to cells generated according to the standard protocol; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we found that in IL-15-stimulated CIK cells, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression was upregulated. Upon knockdown of TLR4, the cytolytic activity was considerably compromised. Re-expression of TLR4 in CIK cells restored their function, confirming the essential role of TLR4 in CIK cell cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study demonstrated that TLR4 was essential for the cytotoxicity of CIK cells against tumor cells, which might provide a novel approach to promote the therapeutic efficacy of CIK cells against hematologic malignancy.","['Cai, Chunyuan', 'Chen, Weibo', 'Miao, Daoyi', 'Cheng, Li', 'Yang, Guojing', 'Zhang, Linzhou', 'Li, Yongjiang', 'Zhang, Lei']","['Cai C', 'Chen W', 'Miao D', 'Cheng L', 'Yang G', 'Zhang L', 'Li Y', 'Zhang L']","[""Department of Orthopedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Rui'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131213,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['000355190 [pii]', '10.1159/000355190 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2014;132(1):5-9. doi: 10.1159/000355190.

METHODS: MTT assay was used to detect the cell viability. Flow Cytometry analysis and caspase-3 activity assay were used to measure apoptosis of APL cells. Caspase-3 and Bax levels were analyzed by western blot and let-7d and miR-766 levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: As2O3 significantly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in APL cells. Several microRNAs, including let-7d and miR-766, were dysregulated in APL cells treated with As2O3. The expression of caspase-3 and Bax, which are targets of let-7d and miR-766, respectively, were up-regulated in As2O3 treated cells. Transfection of let-7d and miR-766 into NB4 cells decreased the expression of caspase-3 and Bax, respectively. Correspondingly, transfection of these microRNAs increased NB4 cell viability. As2O3 induced degradation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML), and then induced the down-regulation of both let-7d and miR-766 in NB4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We construct a dysregulated microRNA network involved in As2O3-induced apoptosis in APL. Targeting this network may be a new strategy for the prevention of side effects associated with APL treatment with As2O3.","['Liang, Haihai', 'Li, Xuelian', 'Wang, Lu', 'Yu, Shaonan', 'Xu, Zhidan', 'Gu, Yunyan', 'Pan, Zhenwei', 'Li, Tianyu', 'Hu, Meiyu', 'Cui, Hairong', 'Liu, Xue', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Xu, Chaoqian', 'Guo, Rui', 'Lu, Yanjie', 'Yang, Baofeng', 'Shan, Hongli']","['Liang H', 'Li X', 'Wang L', 'Yu S', 'Xu Z', 'Gu Y', 'Pan Z', 'Li T', 'Hu M', 'Cui H', 'Liu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu C', 'Guo R', 'Lu Y', 'Yang B', 'Shan H']","['Department of Pharmacology (the State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine-Pharmaceutics of China, Harbin, P.

Other endpoints included pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: AT9283 was administered as a continuous 72-hour infusion every 21 days. Doses were escalated by a standard 3 + 3 design. After the MTD for the 72-hour infusion was identified, infusion duration was increased incrementally to 96 hours and 120 hours. In total, 48 patients received >/= 1 cycle of AT9283. Median age was 61 years (range, 22-86 years); 56% were men; 75% were diagnosed with AML; and 89% had received >/= 3 (up to 16) prior lines of therapy. RESULTS: 324 mg/m(2)/72 h AT9283 was determined to be the MTD. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were myocardial infarction, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, tumor lysis syndrome, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. Other AT9283-related toxicities (non-DLT) included myelosuppression, predominantly leukopenia and mucositis. Bone marrow blasts decreased >/= 38% after AT9283 treatment in approximately one-third of patients with relapsed/refractory AML; however, this effect was transient and no objective responses were achieved, despite evidence of Aurora kinase B inhibition. Two patients with accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia showed evidence of benefit, manifested as a cytogenetic response in 1 case; 1 patient completed 6 cycles of treatment. Exposure to AT9283 was generally dose proportional. CONCLUSION: AT9283 tolerability was strongly dose-dependent, with reversible myelosuppression predominating at lower doses and events such as cardiovascular toxicities manifesting at higher doses. Clinical trials with AT9283 are ongoing in alternative patient populations.","['Foran, James', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Wierda, William', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Burger, Jan', 'Yule, Murray', 'Langford, Gillian', 'Lyons, John', 'Ayrton, John', 'Lock, Victoria', 'Borthakur, Gautham', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Foran J', 'Ravandi F', 'Wierda W', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Kadia T', 'Burger J', 'Yule M', 'Langford G', 'Lyons J', 'Ayrton J', 'Lock V', 'Borthakur G', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, AL.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

METHOD: Among 651 BD patients sequentially hospitalized in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1995 to 2012, 41 patients developed malignancies. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without malignancies, as well as between patients with hematological and solid malignancies. RESULTS: The numbers of patients with various types of malignancies were listed as follows: (i) 29 cases developed hematologic malignancies which included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as the most common diagnosis in 20 cases, leukemia in seven cases, anaplastic anemia in two cases and lymphoma in one case; (ii) 13 cases developed malignant solid neoplasms which included colorectal cancer in three cases, urothelial carcinoma of bladder in two cases, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, renal cell carcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary in one case each. Female gender, older age and gastrointestinal tract involvement were more frequently observed among patients with malignancy than those without. Older age, longer disease duration were more commonly seen in BD patients with solid neoplasms than in those with hematologic malignancies. Exacerbation of BD manifestations during the emergence of malignancy was more frequently observed among patients with hematologic malignancies than among those with malignant solid neoplasms. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that MDS and colorectal cancer were the most common hematologic malignancy and malignant solid neoplasm associated with BD, respectively. Gastrointestinal involvement is likely to be a risk factor for BD patients to develop malignancy. Further studies will be required to ascertain the pathogenic link between these two entities.","['Lin, Yi', 'Li, Guohua', 'Zheng, Wenjie', 'Tian, Xinping', 'Zhang, Fengchun']","['Lin Y', 'Li G', 'Zheng W', 'Tian X', 'Zhang F']","['Department of Oncology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131220,England,Int J Rheum Dis,International journal of rheumatic diseases,101474930,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Behcet Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'China', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/1756-185X.12269 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Rheum Dis. 2014 May;17(4):459-65. doi: 10.1111/1756-185X.12269.

The frequency and suppressing activity of Treg cells in general are high in different malignancies. We wanted to identify the role and regulation of CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) Treg cells in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). We have included patients at diagnosis (n = 54), patients in clinical remission (n = 32) and normal healthy individuals (n = 35). These diagnosed patients demonstrated a lower number of CD4(+) CD25(+) cells co-expressing a higher level of FoxP3, interleukin-10, transforming growth factor-beta and CD152/CTLA-4 than the normal population. Treg cells from patients showed a higher suppressive capability on CD4(+) CD25(-) responder T (Tresp) cells than normal. The frequency and immunosuppressive potential of CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) Treg cells became high with the progression of malignancy in B-ALL. Relative distribution of Tresp and Treg cells was only ~5 : 1 in B-ALL but ~35 : 1 in normal healthy individuals, further confirming the elevated immunosuppression in patients. A co-culture study at these definite ex vivo ratios, indicated that Treg cells from B-ALL patients exhibited higher immunosuppression than Treg cells from normal healthy individuals. After chemotherapy using the MCP841 protocol, the frequency of CD4(+) CD25(+) cells was gradually enhanced with the reduction of FoxP3, interleukin-10 positivity corresponded with disease presentation, indicating reduced immunosuppression. Taken together, our study indicated that the CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) Treg cells played an important role in immunosuppression, resulting in a positive disease-correlation in these patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on the frequency, regulation and functionality of Treg cells in B-ALL.","['Bhattacharya, Kaushik', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Bhattacharya K', 'Chandra S', 'Mandal C']","['Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Jadavpur, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3992054,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/05/31 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imm.12237 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2014 May;142(1):124-39. doi: 10.1111/imm.12237.,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'FoxP3', 'immunosuppression', 'regulatory T cells', 'responder T cells']",,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term outcomes depend on the age of the patient and the biological characteristics of the leukemic cells. While pediatric patients achieve cure more often than adults, therapy can continue to be improved for all patients with this disease. AREAS COVERED: The current management strategy for ALL is reviewed. Recently, targeted therapies have been shown to improve survival in subsets of patients, most notably in those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL or with leukemic cells that express the surface antigen CD20. Several innovative compounds are under investigation, and the most promising ones to date will be discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The incorporation of monoclonal antibody therapy represents a targeted and powerful approach to the management of ALL. Bispecific T-cell engaging agents, such as blinatumomab, are able to facilitate immune-mediated killing of leukemia cells. Immunoconjugates (i.e., monoclonal antibodies linked to various cytotoxins) allow small doses of very potent chemotherapy to be delivered directly to a leukemia cell with hope of sparing normal tissue. As the genetic and molecular characterization of ALL is more completely understood, patients will receive treatment plans that are more individualized than previously possible.","['Mathisen, Michael S', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Jabbour, Elias J']","['Mathisen MS', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Jabbour EJ']","['M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Departments of Pharmacy and Leukemia , 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131220,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2013/12/21 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2013/12/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728214.2014.872629 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2014 Mar;19(1):37-50. doi: 10.1517/14728214.2014.872629.

Our 36-year old proband presented with incidentally detected thrombocytopenia and a family history suggestive of FPDMM. Contrary to previously described families, affected members of our kindred express an eczematous phenotype, reportedly most severe in members who develop leukemia. Pedigree analysis shows that the L472X mutation tracks with thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia, and eczema. The L472X mutation produces a stably expressed RUNX1 protein product with a corresponding decrease in wild type RUNX1 expression. Our data supports the inclusion of eczema in the FPDMM phenotype and suggests the possibility that the RUNX1 L472X mutant causes the type of dominant negative affect that is associated with an elevated risk of leukemia in FPDMM families.","['Sorrell, A', 'Espenschied, C', 'Wang, W', 'Weitzel, J', 'Chu, S', 'Parker, P', 'Saldivar, S', 'Bhatia, R']","['Sorrell A', 'Espenschied C', 'Wang W', 'Weitzel J', 'Chu S', 'Parker P', 'Saldivar S', 'Bhatia R']","['Department of Pediatrics, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA ; Division of Clinical Cancer Genetics, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte; CA.', 'Division of Clinical Cancer Genetics, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte; CA.', 'Division of Population Sciences, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Clinical Cancer Genetics, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte; CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplantation, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplantation, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplantation, City Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Clin Med,International journal of clinical medicine,101571689,,,,PMC3864030,2013/12/20 06:00,2013/12/20 06:01,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4236/ijcm.2012.37110 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Med. 2012 Dec 1;3(7). doi: 10.4236/ijcm.2012.37110.,,['NOTNLM'],"['FPDMM', 'L472X', 'RUNX1c isoform', 'eczema', 'hereditary leukemia']",,['R25 CA085771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS459174'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, immune tolerance mechanisms that normally protect healthy tissues from autoimmune damage pose a formidable barrier to the development of effective anti-tumor immunity. Because malignant cells are derived from self-tissues, the majority of defined tumor antigens are either shared or aberrantly expressed self-proteins. Eliciting productive T cell responses against such proteins is challenging, as most high-affinity, self-reactive T cells are purged during thymic selection. Some T cells capable of tumor antigen recognition escape thymic deletion, but are functionally inhibited by peripheral tolerance mechanisms which limit their ability to attack a developing malignancy. Alternatively, some tumors express antigens derived from mutated self-proteins, viral proteins or self proteins expressed only during embryonic development. These antigens are recognized by the immune system as foreign and could be recognized by a relatively large number of peripheral T cells. Even in this scenario, tumors evade otherwise effective T cell responses by employing potent immunosuppressive mechanisms within their local environment. In the setting for solid malignancies, such as melanoma, a growing number of putative immune evasion mechanisms have been characterized. However, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a systemic disease, and the pathways it exploits to subvert the host immune response may be quite different than those of a solid tumor. Much remains unknown regarding the immune escape mechanisms promoted by AML, and whether efforts to thwart tolerance may influence the progression of this disease.

Transfer of genes encoding target antigen-specific receptors enables polyclonal T cells to redirect toward cancer cells and virally infected cells expressing those defined antigens. Using this technology, a large population of redirected T cells displaying uniform therapeutic properties has been produced, powerfully advancing their clinical application as ""cellular drugs"" for adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. Clinically, anticancer adoptive immunotherapy using these genetically engineered T cells has an impressive and proven track record. Notable examples include the dramatic benefit of chimeric antigen receptor gene-modified T cells redirected towards B-cell lineage antigen CD19 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the impressive outcomes in the use of TCR gene-modified T cells redirected towards NY-ESO-1, a representative cancer-testis antigen, in patients with advanced melanoma and synovial cell sarcoma.

By using biochemical and bioinformatics tools, we identified procaspase-8 (procasp8), the caspase-8 zymogen, as a cytosolic target for Lyn in B-CLL cells, the phosphorylation of which at Tyr380 promotes the formation of an inactive procasp8 homodimer. This complex remains segregated in the cytosol and appears to be crucial in mediating the antiapoptotic function of Lyn in this disease. The significance of the Lyn-procasp8 axis in impairing apoptosis in B-CLL cells was further confirmed by pharmacological and genetic inhibition of procasp8, which drastically reduced the apoptosis induced by the SFK inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib. Our data highlight that Lyn's dysregulated expression, activity, and localization in B-CLLs support resistance to cell demise by inhibiting an early player of apoptotic signaling, and potentially broaden the perspectives of developing new strategies for the treatment of this disease.","['Zonta, Francesca', 'Pagano, Mario Angelo', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Tibaldi, Elena', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Gattazzo, Cristina', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Mazzorana, Marco', 'Bordin, Luciana', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Brunati, Anna Maria']","['Zonta F', 'Pagano MA', 'Trentin L', 'Tibaldi E', 'Frezzato F', 'Gattazzo C', 'Martini V', 'Trimarco V', 'Mazzorana M', 'Bordin L', 'Semenzato G', 'Brunati AM']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131218,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proteome)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proteome/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/04/05 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36047-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-02-485540 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 6;123(6):875-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-02-485540.

MLN8237 (alisertib) is a novel inhibitor of AAK that is being developed for the treatment of advanced malignancies. The objectives of this phase I study were to establish the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles of escalating doses of MLN8237 in patients with relapsed or refractory heme-lymphatic malignancies. METHODS: Sequential cohorts of patients received MLN8237 orally as either a powder-in-capsule (PIC) or enteric-coated tablet (ECT) formulation. Patients received MLN8237 PIC 25-90 mg for 14 or 21 consecutive days plus 14 or 7 days' rest, respectively, or MLN8237 ECT, at a starting dose of 40 mg/day once-daily (QD) for 14 days plus 14 days' rest, all in 28-day cycles. Subsequent cohorts received MLN8237 ECT 30-50 mg twice-daily (BID) for 7 days plus 14 days' rest in 21-day cycles. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were enrolled (PIC n = 28, ECT n = 30). The most frequent grade >/=3 drug-related toxicities were neutropenia (45 %), thrombocytopenia (28 %), anemia (19 %), and leukopenia (19 %). The maximum tolerated dose on the ECT 7-day schedule was 50 mg BID. The terminal half-life of MLN8237 was approximately 19 h. Six (13 %) patients achieved partial responses and 13 (28 %) stable disease.

As data are conflicting as to whether OCT1 transports imatinib and may serve as a clinical biomarker, we used a combination of different approaches including animal experiments to elucidate comprehensively the impact of OCT1 on cellular imatinib uptake. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Transport of imatinib was studied using OCT1-expressing Xenopus oocytes, mammalian cell lines (HEK293, MDCK, V79) stably expressing OCT1, human leukemic cells, and Oct1-knockout mice. OCT1 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed in leukemic cells from patients with imatinib-naive CML as well as in cell lines. RESULTS: Transport and inhibition studies showed that overexpression of functional OCT1 protein in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell lines did not lead to an increased cellular accumulation of imatinib. The CML cell lines (K562, Meg-01, LAMA84) and leukemic cells from patients expressed neither OCT1 mRNA nor protein as demonstrated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy, yet they showed a considerable imatinib uptake. Oct1 deficiency in mice had no influence on plasma and hepatic imatinib concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: These data clearly demonstrate that cellular uptake of imatinib is independent of OCT1, and therefore OCT1 is apparently not a valid biomarker for imatinib resistance.","['Nies, Anne T', 'Schaeffeler, Elke', 'van der Kuip, Heiko', 'Cascorbi, Ingolf', 'Bruhn, Oliver', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Hofmann, Ute', 'Volk, Christopher', 'Hu, Shuiying', 'Baker, Sharyn D', 'Sparreboom, Alex', 'Ruth, Peter', 'Koepsell, Hermann', 'Schwab, Matthias']","['Nies AT', 'Schaeffeler E', 'van der Kuip H', 'Cascorbi I', 'Bruhn O', 'Kneba M', 'Pott C', 'Hofmann U', 'Volk C', 'Hu S', 'Baker SD', 'Sparreboom A', 'Ruth P', 'Koepsell H', 'Schwab M']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, and University of Tubingen; Institute of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, University of Tubingen; Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen; Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel; Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131218,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Xenopus laevis']",PMC3932302,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1999 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1999 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Feb 15;20(4):985-94. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1999.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which the PTEN/Tcl1 axis regulates the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We compared levels of PTEN and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) mRNA in human HCC and healthy liver tissue. We measured PPP flux, glucose consumption, lactate production, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels and lipid accumulation. We investigated the PTEN/Tcl1 axis using molecular biology, biochemistry and mass spectrometry analysis. We assessed proliferation, apoptosis and senescence in cultured cells, and tumour formation in mice. RESULTS: We showed that PTEN inhibited the PPP pathway in human liver tumours. Through the PPP, PTEN suppressed glucose consumption and biosynthesis. Mechanistically, the PTEN protein bound to G6PD, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP and prevented the formation of the active G6PD dimer. Tcl1, a coactivator for Akt, reversed the effects of PTEN on biosynthesis. Tcl1 promoted G6PD activity and also increased G6PD pre-mRNA splicing and protein expression in a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNPK)-dependent manner. PTEN also formed a complex with hnRNPK, which inhibited G6PD pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, PTEN inactivated Tcl1 via glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta)-mediated phosphorylation. Importantly, Tcl1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of HCC to sorafenib, whereas G6PD knockdown inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish the counteraction between PTEN and Tcl1 as a key mechanism that regulates the PPP and suggest that targeting the PTEN/Tcl1/hnRNPK/G6PD axis could open up possibilities for therapeutic intervention and improve the prognosis of patients with HCC.","['Hong, Xuehui', 'Song, Ruipeng', 'Song, Huiwen', 'Zheng, Tongsen', 'Wang, Jiabei', 'Liang, Yingjian', 'Qi, Shuyi', 'Lu, Zhaoyang', 'Song, Xuan', 'Jiang, Hongchi', 'Liu, Lianxin', 'Zhang, Zhiyong']","['Hong X', 'Song R', 'Song H', 'Zheng T', 'Wang J', 'Liang Y', 'Qi S', 'Lu Z', 'Song X', 'Jiang H', 'Liu L', 'Zhang Z']","['Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine and Department of Emergence, Baoan Hospital, Southern Medical University, ShenZhen, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Gerontology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Robert-Wood-Johnson Medical School University Hospital, University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131218,England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,"['0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '146410-60-8 (HNRNPK protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.4.1.11 (Glycogen Synthase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase/metabolism', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*physiology', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism']",,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/11/08 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gutjnl-2013-305302 [pii]', '10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305302 [doi]']",ppublish,Gut. 2014 Oct;63(10):1635-47. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305302.

This activity is essential for its functions in stimulating efficient lytic infection and productive reactivation from latency. ICP0 targets a number of proteins that are modified by the small ubiquitin-like SUMO family of proteins, and it includes a number of short sequences that are related to SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs). Therefore, ICP0 has characteristics that are related to those of cellular SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase enzymes. Here, we analyze the impact of mutation of a number of SIM-like sequences (SLSs) within ICP0 on HSV-1 replication and gene expression and their requirement for ICP0-mediated degradation of both sumoylated and unmodified promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and other sumoylated cellular proteins. One SLS in the central portion of the ICP0 sequence (SLS4) was found to be absolutely required for targeting cellular sumoylated species in general and sumoylated forms of PML other than those of PML isoform I. Mutation of a group of SLSs in the C-terminal quarter of ICP0 also reduced ICP0-mediated degradation of sumoylated PML in a cooperative manner. Although mutation of individual SLSs caused only modest decreases in viral replication, combined mutation of SLS4 with SLS sequences in the C-terminal quarter of the protein reduced plaque formation efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. These results provide further evidence that the biological activities of ICP0 are connected with host cell sumoylation events. IMPORTANCE: Herpes simplex virus type 1 protein ICP0 plays important roles in regulating the initial stages of lytic infection and productive reactivation from latency. ICP0 mediates its effects through inducing the degradation of cellular proteins that have repressive effects on viral gene expression. An increasing number of cellular proteins are known to be sensitive to ICP0-mediated degradation; therefore, it is important to understand how ICP0 selects its substrates for degradation. This study identifies sequence motifs within ICP0 that are involved in targeting cellular proteins that are modified by the SUMO family of ubiquitin-like proteins and describes how mutation of combinations of these motifs causes a 100-fold defect in viral infectivity.","['Everett, Roger D', 'Boutell, Chris', 'Pheasant, Kathleen', 'Cuchet-Lourenco, Delphine', 'Orr, Anne']","['Everett RD', 'Boutell C', 'Pheasant K', 'Cuchet-Lourenco D', 'Orr A']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131218,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteolysis', 'RING Finger Domains', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virus Replication']",PMC3958091,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03417-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03417-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Mar;88(5):2763-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03417-13.

HTLV-1 Tax-expressing cells show resistance to apoptosis induced by Fas ligand (FasL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The regulation of Tax on the autophagy pathway in HeLa cells and peripheral T cells was recently reported, but the function and underlying molecular mechanism of the Tax-regulated autophagy are not yet well defined. Here, we report that HTLV-1 Tax deregulates the autophagy pathway, which plays a protective role during the death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis of human U251 astroglioma cells. The cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), which is upregulated by Tax, also contributes to the resistance against DR-mediated apoptosis. Both Tax-induced autophagy and Tax-induced c-FLIP expression require Tax-induced activation of IkappaB kinases (IKK). Furthermore, Tax-induced c-FLIP expression is regulated through the Tax-IKK-NF-kappaB signaling pathway, whereas Tax-triggered autophagy depends on the activation of IKK but not the activation of NF-kappaB. In addition, DR-mediated apoptosis is correlated with the degradation of Tax, which can be facilitated by the inhibitors of autophagy. IMPORTANCE: Our study reveals that Tax-deregulated autophagy is a protective mechanism for DR-mediated apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of Tax-induced autophagy is also illuminated, which is different from Tax-increased c-FLIP. Tax can be degraded via manipulation of autophagy and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results outline a complex regulatory network between and among apoptosis, autophagy, and Tax and also present evidence that autophagy represents a new possible target for therapeutic intervention for the HTVL-1 related diseases.","['Wang, Weimin', 'Zhou, Jiansuo', 'Shi, Juan', 'Zhang, Yaxi', 'Liu, Shilian', 'Liu, Yanxin', 'Zheng, Dexian']","['Wang W', 'Zhou J', 'Shi J', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu S', 'Liu Y', 'Zheng D']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131218,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', '*Autophagy/drug effects/genetics', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Phagosomes/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Receptors, Death Domain/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC3958099,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03025-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03025-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Mar;88(5):2786-98. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03025-13.

In some immunocompromised hosts, the reversed halo sign (RHS) has been described on the pulmonary computed tomographic (CT) scan of patients with mucormycosis. METHODS: This study reports a single-center experience with PM exclusively in patients with acute leukemia. Clinical records, laboratory results, and CT scans were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the RHS for the early identification and treatment of PM, with regard to outcomes in these patients. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2012, 16 cases of proven PM were diagnosed among 752 consecutive patients receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloblastic or lymphoblastic leukemia. At the time PM was diagnosed, all patients but one were neutropenic. The study of sequential thoracic CT scans showed that during the first week of the disease, the RHS was observed in 15 of 16 patients (94%). Initially, other radiologic findings (multiple nodules and pleural effusion) were less frequent, but appeared later in the course of the disease (6% and 12% before vs 64% and 55% after the first week). After the diagnosis of PM, median overall survival was 25 weeks (range, 3-193 weeks), and 6 patients (38%) died before day 90. CONCLUSIONS: In the particular setting of neutropenic leukemia patients with pulmonary infection, the presence of the RHS on CT was a strong indicator of PM. It could allow the early initiation of appropriate therapy and thus improve the outcome.","['Legouge, C', 'Caillot, D', 'Chretien, M L', 'Lafon, I', 'Ferrant, E', 'Audia, S', 'Pages, P B', 'Roques, M', 'Estivalet, L', 'Martin, L', 'Maitre, T', 'Bastie, J N', 'Dalle, F']","['Legouge C', 'Caillot D', 'Chretien ML', 'Lafon I', 'Ferrant E', 'Audia S', 'Pages PB', 'Roques M', 'Estivalet L', 'Martin L', 'Maitre T', 'Bastie JN', 'Dalle F']",['Department of Clinical Hematology.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131218,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucormycosis/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2013/12/20 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cit929 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/cit929 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2014 Mar;58(5):672-8. doi: 10.1093/cid/cit929.

CD34+ donor cell chimerism (DCC) analysis in peripheral blood samples from CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myleodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients proved to be a highly sensitive diagnostic tool that is useful to detect imminent relapse significantly earlier compared to total white blood cell donor cell chimerism monitoring. However, flow-cytometric enrichment of CD34+ cells requires high efforts to human resources and equipment. We present a novel semi-automated CD34+ DCC analysis procedure-employing a magnetic cell-enrichment device, DNA extraction, and short tandem repeat profiling-without the need for flow-cytometric cell sorting. Monitoring 85 patients with AML and MDS over a period of 4 years 24 relapses were detected. Semi-automated peripheral blood CD34+ DCC was diminished below 80 % in all cases of systemic relapse. Significant decrease of the CD34+ DCC value was detected 29-42 days before overt cytological relapse. Our method provides a rapid and sensitive tool for monitoring AML and MDS patients after allogeneic SCT with regard to engraftment and early detection of relapse. Here, we propose a novel semi-automated procedure for CD34+ DCC analysis after allogeneic SCT that is simple, reliable, and therefore applicable in all hematologic laboratories.","['Hoffmann, Joerg Christian', 'Stabla, Kathleen', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Volkmann, Thorsten', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Brendel, Cornelia']","['Hoffmann JC', 'Stabla K', 'Burchert A', 'Volkmann T', 'Bornhauser M', 'Thiede C', 'Neubauer A', 'Brendel C']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Baldingerstrasse, 35043, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131219,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Chimera/*blood']",,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1961-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Feb;93(2):279-85. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1961-4.

Special focus is on which one of the three red cell parameters (hemoglobin-HB, hematocrit-HCT and red cell mass-RCM) should be used as the diagnostic hallmark of PV. The revised BCSH employed a persistently raised HCT level as the first diagnostic criterion in combination with the presence of a JAK2V617F mutation. On the other hand, the WHO classification used a raised HB value as a surrogate for increased RCM in association with molecular markers and for the first time, the bone marrow (BM) morphology was included as a minor criterion. Ongoing controversy and discussion regards the use of certain threshold values for HCT and HB as surrogates for RCM as well as the existence of prodromal-latent disease, so-called masked PV (mPV). It has been shown that mPV can be recognized in patients not meeting the required HB or HCT threshold levels by both the WHO and BCSH criteria. These cases present with the same baseline clinical features as overt PV but present worsened survival. A critical reappraisal of the WHO criteria may suggest either to reduce the thresholds for HB or to consider HCT values as major diagnostic criterion, as in the BCSH, in association with JAK2V617F mutation. The clinical utility of using HCT as reference variable is supported also by results of clinical trials which explicitly recommend to use the HCT threshold for monitoring treatment. In questionable cases as in mPV, BM biopsy examinations should be mandated together with mutation analysis.","['Barbui, T', 'Thiele, J', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Tefferi, A']","['Barbui T', 'Thiele J', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Tefferi A']","['Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Research Foundation, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20131219,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis', 'World Health Organization']",,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013380 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.380 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1191-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.380.

Overall, Ph-positive HeH patients did not have an inferior overall survival compared with Ph-negative patients (P=0.2: 50 vs 57% at 5 years). Trisomy of chromosome 4 was associated with a superior outcome in Ph-negative patients, whereas +5 and +20 were associated with an inferior outcome in Ph-positive and Ph-negative patients, respectively.

We explored the spatial incidence patterns of common cancers in Saudi Arabia using spatial autocorrelation analyses, employing the global Moran's I and Anselin's local Moran's I statistics to detect nonrandom incidence patterns. Global ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and local geographically-weighted regression (GWR) were applied to examine the spatial correlation of cancer incidences at the city level. Population-based records of cancers diagnosed between 1998 and 2004 were used. Male lung cancer and female breast cancer exhibited positive statistically significant global Moran's I index values, indicating a tendency toward clustering. The Anselin's local Moran's I analyses revealed small significant clusters of lung cancer, prostate cancer and Hodgkin's disease among males in the Eastern region and significant clusters of thyroid cancers in females in the Eastern and Riyadh regions. Additionally, both regression methods found significant associations among various cancers. For example, OLS and GWR revealed significant spatial associations among NHL, leukemia and Hodgkin's disease (r(2) = 0.49-0.67 using OLS and r(2) = 0.52-0.68 using GWR) and between breast and prostate cancer (r(2) = 0.53 OLS and 0.57 GWR) in Saudi Arabian cities.

Stable repression is crucial for preventing inappropriate DNA synthesis and the maintenance of a prolonged senescent state. Many of these genes are targets for E2F transcription factors. The pRB pathway plays a major role in senescence by directly repressing E2Fs and also by regulating chromatin at the promoters of E2F target genes using its LXCXE cleft-dependent interactions. In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanisms by which pRB stably silences E2F target gene transcription during cellular senescence. We report that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, endogenous promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) associates with E2F target genes in a pRB LXCXE-dependent manner during HrasV12-induced senescence. Furthermore, using a PML-IV-induced senescence model, we show that the pRB LXCXE binding cleft is essential for PML association with gene promoters, silencing of E2F target genes, and stable cell cycle exit. Binding assays show that pRB can interact with PML specifically during senescence, suggesting that signaling events in senescence regulate assembly of PML and pRB to establish heterochromatin and create a permanent cell cycle arrest.","['Talluri, Srikanth', 'Dick, Frederick A']","['Talluri S', 'Dick FA']","['London Regional Cancer Program; Western University; London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Biochemistry; Western University; London, Ontario, Canada.', ""London Regional Cancer Program; Western University; London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Biochemistry; Western University; London, Ontario, Canada; Children's Health Research Institute; Western University; London, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131218,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'E2F Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Heterochromatin/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",,2013/12/20 06:00,2015/04/17 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['27527 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.27527 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(4):641-51. doi: 10.4161/cc.27527.

We investigated mutations in the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene in Asian cohorts of T-LGL L and CLPD-NK (n = 42 and 11, respectively). Two mutations, Y640F and D661Y, were identified using direct sequencing or allele-specific (AS) PCR. Y640F and D661Y mutations were found in seven and 18 patients, respectively. Two patients were positive for both mutations. Frequencies of STAT3 mutations in T-LGL L and CLPD-NK were 47.6% and 27.2%, respectively. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was associated with the mutations (P = 0.005). The mutations were persistently found at stable levels in some patients after more than 5 years using AS-quantitative PCR. The results of the present study indicate that the SH2 domain of the STAT3 gene is frequently mutated in Asian T-LGL L and CLPD-NK, and that PRCA is closely correlated with the mutations.","['Ishida, Fumihiro', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Sekiguchi, Nodoka', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Taira, Chiaki', 'Momose, Kayoko', 'Nishina, Sayaka', 'Senoo, Noriko', 'Sakai, Hitoshi', 'Ito, Toshiro', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam']","['Ishida F', 'Matsuda K', 'Sekiguchi N', 'Makishima H', 'Taira C', 'Momose K', 'Nishina S', 'Senoo N', 'Sakai H', 'Ito T', 'Kwong YL']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan; Department of Biomedical Laboratory Sciences, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140122,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC4317942,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12341 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2014 Mar;105(3):342-6. doi: 10.1111/cas.12341.

These observations are clinically relevant; an increase in levels of DNMT3A in association with downregulation of miR-217 were noted in leukemia cells isolated from individuals with BCR/ABL TKI-resistant Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) and CML. Further studies with TKI-resistant K562 cells found that forced expression of miR-217 inhibited expression of DNMT3A through a miR-217-binding site within the 3'-untranslated region of DNMT3A and sensitized these cells to growth inhibition mediated by the TKI. Of note, long-term exposure of K562 cells to dasatinib (10 nM) together with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) (0.1 muM) potently inhibited proliferation of these cells in association with upregulation of miR-217 and downregulation of DNMT3A in vitro. In addition, a decrease in levels of DNMT3A and an increase in levels of miR-217 were noted in K562 tumors growing in immune-deficient mice that were treated with the combination of 5-AzadC and dasatinib. Taken together, Ph(+) leukemia cells acquire TKI resistance via downregulation of miR-217 and upregulation of DNMT3A. Inhibition of DNMT3A by forced expression of miR-217 or 5-AzadC may be useful to prevent drug resistance in individuals who receive TKI.","['Nishioka, Chie', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Jing', 'Nobumoto, Atsuya', 'Tsuda, Masayuki', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Nobumoto A', 'Tsuda M', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140130,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (MIRN217 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Dasatinib', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4317938,2013/12/20 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2013/12/20 06:00'],"['2013/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12339 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2014 Mar;105(3):297-307. doi: 10.1111/cas.12339.

Most oxazaphosphorines are prodrugs that require hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes to generate active alkylating moieties before manifesting their chemotherapeutic effects. Meanwhile, oxazaphosphorines can also be transformed into non-therapeutic byproducts by various drug-metabolizing enzymes. Clinically, oxazaphosphorines are often administered in combination with other chemotherapeutics in adjuvant treatments. As such, the therapeutic efficacy, off-target toxicity, and unintentional drug-drug interactions of oxazaphosphorines have been long-lasting clinical concerns and heightened focuses of scientific literatures. Recent evidence suggests that xenobiotic receptors may play important roles in regulating the metabolism and clearance of oxazaphosphorines. Drugs as modulators of xenobiotic receptors can affect the therapeutic efficacy, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics of coadministered oxazaphosphorines, providing a new molecular mechanism of drug-drug interactions. Here, we review current advances regarding the influence of xenobiotic receptors, particularly, the constitutive androstane receptor, the pregnane X receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, on the bioactivation and detoxification of oxazaphosphorines, with a focus on cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.","['Wang, Duan', 'Wang, Hongbing']","['Wang D', 'Wang H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, 20 Penn Street, Baltimore MD 21201, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, 20 Penn Street, Baltimore MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Acta Pharm Sin B,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as imatinib and nilotinib, have emerged as leading compounds with which to treat CML. t(9;22) is not restricted to CML, 20-30% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases also carry the Ph. However, TKIs are not as effective in the treatment of Ph+ ALL as in CML. In this study, the Ph+ cell lines JURL-MK2 and SUP-B15 were used to investigate TKI resistance mechanisms and the sensitization of Ph+ tumor cells to TKI treatment. The annexin V/PI (propidium iodide) assay revealed that nilotinib induced apoptosis in JURL-MK2 cells, but not in SUP-B15 cells. Since there was no mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 in cell line SUP-B15, the cells were not generally unresponsive to TKI, as evidenced by dephosphorylation of the BCR-ABL1 downstream targets, Crk-like protein (CrkL) and Grb-associated binder-2 (GAB2). Resistance to apoptosis after nilotinib treatment was accompanied by the constitutive and nilotinib unresponsive activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Treatment of SUP-B15 cells with the dual PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ235 alone induced apoptosis in a low percentage of cells, while combining nilotinib and BEZ235 led to a synergistic effect. The main role of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and the reason for apoptosis in the nilotinib-resistant cells was the block of the translational machinery, leading to the rapid downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MDM2 (human homolog of the murine double minute-2). These findings highlight MDM2 as a potential therapeutic target to increase TKI-mediated apoptosis and imply that the combination of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and TKI might form a novel strategy to combat TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 positive leukemia.","['Ding, Jie', 'Romani, Julia', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Nagel, Stefan', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar']","['Ding J', 'Romani J', 'Zaborski M', 'MacLeod RA', 'Nagel S', 'Drexler HG', 'Quentmeier H']","['Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131211,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3859659,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0083510 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-32538 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 11;8(12):e83510. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0083510. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its role as a stable heterodimer with BRCA1, increasing evidence indicates that BARD1 also has BRCA1-independent oncogenic functions. Here, we investigate BARD1 expression and function in human acute myeloid leukemias and its modulation by epigenetic mechanism(s) and microRNAs. We show that the HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor) Vorinostat reduces BARD1 mRNA levels by increasing miR-19a and miR-19b expression levels. Moreover, we identify a specific BARD1 isoform, which might act as tumor diagnostic and prognostic markers.","['Lepore, Ilaria', ""Dell'Aversana, Carmela"", 'Pilyugin, Maxim', 'Conte, Mariarosaria', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'De Bellis, Floriana', 'Tambaro, Francesco P', 'Izzo, Tiziana', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Irminger-Finger, Irmgard', 'Altucci, Lucia']","['Lepore I', ""Dell'Aversana C"", 'Pilyugin M', 'Conte M', 'Nebbioso A', 'De Bellis F', 'Tambaro FP', 'Izzo T', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrara F', 'Irminger-Finger I', 'Altucci L']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy ; Institute of Genetics and Biophysics (IGB), Naples, Italy.', 'Molecular Gynecology and Obstetrics Laboratory, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics and Department of Genetic and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva, HUG, Geneve, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy ; Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.', 'Molecular Gynecology and Obstetrics Laboratory, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics and Department of Genetic and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva, HUG, Geneve, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy ; Institute of Genetics and Biophysics (IGB), Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131211,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MIRN19 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BARD1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vorinostat']",PMC3859623,2013/12/19 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0083018 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-28975 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 11;8(12):e83018. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0083018. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies, however, are focused on the protein components, and relatively little is known of how the microenvironmental metabolome might influence tumor survival. In this study, we examined the metabolic profiles of paired bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from 10 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). BM and PB samples from the same patient were collected at the time of diagnosis and after 29 days of induction therapy, at which point all patients were in remission. We employed two analytical platforms, high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to identify and quantify 102 metabolites in the BM and PB. Standard ALL therapy, which includes l-asparaginase, completely removed circulating asparagine, but not glutamine. Statistical analyses of metabolite correlations and network reconstructions showed that the untreated BM microenvironment was characterized by a significant network-level signature: a cluster of highly correlated lipids and metabolites involved in lipid metabolism (p<0.006). In contrast, the strongest correlations in the BM upon remission were observed among amino acid metabolites and derivatives (p<9.2 x 10(-10)). This study provides evidence that metabolic characterization of the cancer niche could generate new hypotheses for the development of cancer therapies.","['Tiziani, Stefano', 'Kang, Yunyi', 'Harjanto, Ricky', 'Axelrod, Joshua', 'Piermarocchi, Carlo', 'Roberts, William', 'Paternostro, Giovanni']","['Tiziani S', 'Kang Y', 'Harjanto R', 'Axelrod J', 'Piermarocchi C', 'Roberts W', 'Paternostro G']","['Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America ; Department of Nutritional Sciences, Dell Pediatric Research Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States of America.', 'Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, United States of America.', ""Rady Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California, United States of America."", 'Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20131213,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', '*Metabolome', '*Metabolomics/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC3862732,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0082859 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-30395 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 13;8(12):e82859. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082859. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have chosen interleukins which are involved in the enhancement of TH2 responses and B cell functions to analyze their potential to improve a prophylactic adenovirus-based anti-retroviral vaccine with regard to antibody and virus-specific CD4(+) T cell responses. Mice were vaccinated with an adenoviral vector which encodes and displays the Friend Virus (FV) surface envelope protein gp70 (Ad.pIXgp70) in combination with adenoviral vectors encoding the interleukins IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7 or IL23. Co-application of Ad.pIXgp70 with Ad.IL5, Ad.IL6 or Ad.IL23 resulted in improved protection with high control over FV-induced splenomegaly and reduced viral loads. Mice co-immunized with adenoviral vectors encoding IL5 or IL23 showed increased neutralizing antibody responses while mice co-immunized with Ad.IL6 or Ad.IL23 showed improved FV-specific CD4(+) T cell responses compared to mice immunized with Ad.pIXgp70 alone. We show that the co-application of adenoviral vectors encoding specific interleukins is suitable to improve the vaccination efficacy of an anti-retroviral vaccine. Improved protection correlated with improved CD4(+) T cell responses and especially with higher neutralizing antibody titers. The co-application of selected interleukin-encoding adenoviral vectors is a valuable tool for vaccination with regard to enhancement of antibody mediated immunity.","['Ohs, Inga', 'Windmann, Sonja', 'Wildner, Oliver', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Bayer, Wibke']","['Ohs I', 'Windmann S', 'Wildner O', 'Dittmer U', 'Bayer W']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of Pharmacovigilance, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/*immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Splenomegaly', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Vaccination', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",PMC3857891,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0082528 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-31435 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 4;8(12):e82528. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082528. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, statistical tests have often been applied to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by the employment of the state-of-the-art learning machines including the Support Vector Machines (SVM) in particular. The SVM is a typical sample-based classifier whose performance comes down to how discriminant samples are. However, DEGs identified by statistical tests are not guaranteed to result in a training dataset composed of discriminant samples. To tackle this problem, a novel gene ranking method namely the Kernel Matrix Gene Selection (KMGS) is proposed. The rationale of the method, which roots in the fundamental ideas of the SVM algorithm, is described. The notion of ''the separability of a sample'' which is estimated by performing [Formula: see text]-like statistics on each column of the kernel matrix, is first introduced. The separability of a classification problem is then measured, from which the significance of a specific gene is deduced. Also described is a method of Kernel Matrix Sequential Forward Selection (KMSFS) which shares the KMGS method's essential ideas but proceeds in a greedy manner. On three public microarray datasets, our proposed algorithms achieved noticeably competitive performance in terms of the B.632+ error rate.","['Xia, Xiao-Lei', 'Xing, Huanlai', 'Liu, Xueqin']","['Xia XL', 'Xing H', 'Liu X']","['School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, P.R.

Treatment outcomes in relapsed patients with APL previously treated with combined ATRA + arsenic compound therapy were investigated. A retrospective, observational study was conducted of 25 patients with APL (male to female ratio, 17:8; mean age, 36.4+/-10.3 years) exhibiting first-time relapse following combined ATRA + arsenic compound therapy. These patients were subsequently treated with secondary ATRA + arsenic compound therapy, salvage chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy or intrathecal chemotherapy, between January 1994 and December 2010. The overall remission rate, duration of remission and toxic effects were assessed. Patient outcomes included mortality during secondary induction therapy (6/25, 24.0%); complete recovery from central nervous system (CNS) relapse following intrathecal chemotherapy (1/25, 4.0%); complete remission following ATRA + arsenic compound therapy (10/25, 40.0%), chemotherapy (3/25, 12.0%) and targeted therapy (1/25, 4.0%); and non-remission (NR) following ATRA + arsenic compound therapy (4/25, 16%). Four (16.0%) patients were subsequently treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), two of which remained disease-free at the end of the study period and two of which succumbed to the disease. Secondary bone marrow and CNS relapse occurred in 14 (56.0%) patients and one (4.0%) patient, respectively. ATRA + arsenic compound-based combination therapy was effective in re-inducing morphological remission in relapsed patients with APL with previous exposure to ATRA + arsenic compounds, producing low molecular remission rates and high risk of secondary relapse. Furthermore, investigation of early allo-HSCT is required to determine its potential as a therapeutic option for re-inducing morphological remission in relapsed patients with APL with previous exposure to ATRA + arsenic compounds.","['Lu, Jin', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Bao, Li', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Zhu, Honghu', 'Jiang, Bin']","['Lu J', 'Huang X', 'Bao L', 'Jiang H', 'Zhu H', 'Jiang B']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, P.R.

Two weeks after the last vaccine dose, the animals were challenged with syngeneic bcr-abl-transformed 12B1 cells which form solid tumors after subcutaneous administration. At the time of challenge, animals were treated with antibodies against the CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells. The efficacy of the depletion was monitored and found highly effective.

Furthermore, we analyzed PLZF in the normal colonic mucosa (NM) according to anthropometric parameters of the subject. NM exhibited strong CD56 fluorescent staining. This infiltration was lost in both ACF and colorectal carcinoma (CRC), while PLZF presence increased from NM to ACF and CRC. Strong association was found between CD56+ colonic mucosa cell infiltration and body mass index. Interestingly, an increased stromal PLZF-reactivity was present in NM of obese subjects. This study shows that overexpression of PLZF and exclusion of NK cells in dysplastic microenvironment are very early events in the stepwise sequence leading to CRC and that lower levels of CD56+ cells in NM, together with increased levels of PLZF+ cells, can be a reflection of colon cancer risk due to obesity.","['Mariani, Francesco', 'Sena, Paola', 'Magnani, Giulia', 'Mancini, Stefano', 'Palumbo, Carla', 'Ponz de Leon, Maurizio', 'Roncucci, Luca']","['Mariani F', 'Sena P', 'Magnani G', 'Mancini S', 'Palumbo C', 'Ponz de Leon M', 'Roncucci L']","['Department of Diagnostic, Clinical and Public Health Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostic, Clinical and Public Health Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostic, Clinical and Public Health Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostic, Clinical and Public Health Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostic, Clinical and Public Health Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131114,United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', '*Body Size', 'CD2 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Colon/*metabolism', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism/pathology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Middle Aged', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Risk']",PMC3848341,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/09/13 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/630869 [doi]'],epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2013 Nov 14;2013:630869. doi: 10.1155/2013/630869. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MTT(3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was performed to determine the effect of DMAG on doxorubicin sensitivity to K562/DOX cells. Propidium iodide /Hoechst 33342 double staining assay was used to investigate the effect of DMAG on doxorubicin-induced cellular apoptosis. Intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 assay were performed to evaluate the effect of DMAG on drugs efflux activity of P-glycoprotein. RESULTS: DMAG significantly enhanced the doxorubicin cytotoxicity to K562/DOX cells. In the presence of 1.0 muM of DMAG, the IC50 of doxorubicin decreased from 34.93 +/- 1.37 muM to 12.51 +/- 1.28 muM. DMAG of 1.0 muM significantly enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell apoptosis in K562/DOX cells and the enhancement was time-dependent. A significant increase in accumulation of doxorubicin in the presence of DMAG was observed. After treatment of the K562/DOX cells for 1 h with 15.0 muM doxorubicin alone, the fluorescence intensity was 33093.12. With the addition of 1.0 muM of DMAG, the fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin was 2.3-fold higher. A significant increase of accumulation of rhodamine 123 in the presence of DMAG was also observed. With the addition of 1.0 muM of DMAG, the fluorescence intensity was increased by 49.11% compared with rhodamine 123 alone. CONCLUSION: DMAG was shown to effectively enhance chemosensitivity of resistant cells, which makes it might be a suitable candidate for potential MDR-reversing agents.","['Wang, Tian-Xiao', 'Shi, Xiao-Yan', 'Cong, Yue', 'Wang, Shi-Guang', 'Wang, Ying-Ying', 'Zhang, Zhong-Qin']","['Wang TX', 'Shi XY', 'Cong Y', 'Wang SG', 'Wang YY', 'Zhang ZQ']","['Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan Province, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan Province, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan Province, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan Province, China ; College of Huaxin, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan Province, China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Indian J Pharmacol,Indian journal of pharmacology,7902477,"[""0 (5,5'-dimethoxylariciresinol-4-O-glucoside)"", '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Lignans)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Glucosides/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lignans/*therapeutic use']",PMC3847250,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4103/0253-7613.121371 [doi]', 'IJPharm-45-597 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Pharmacol. 2013 Nov-Dec;45(6):597-602. doi: 10.4103/0253-7613.121371.,,['NOTNLM'],"[""5,5'-dimethoxylariciresinol-4'-O-beta-D-glucoside"", 'doxorubicin', 'leukemia', 'multidrug resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 1381 patients from 2 prospective phase 3 trials (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 90206 and AVOREN) of interferon-alpha with or without bevacizumab were analyzed. Both trials recruited previously untreated patients with clear cell mRCC with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2; adequate bone marrow, hepatic, cardiac, and renal function; and controlled blood pressure. The CALGB study served as the training data set, and the AVOREN study served as the testing data set. The dependence between PFS and OS was investigated using the Kendall tau for bivariate time-to-event endpoints. RESULTS: In the training data set, the median OS times among patients who experienced progressive disease at 3 months or 6 months were 6 months and 8 months, respectively, compared with 25 months and 30 months, respectively, (P < .001) in patients who did not develop disease progress. The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were 2.6 (P < .0001) and 2.8 (P < .0001), respectively, for patients who did and did not progress at 3 months or 6 months. The dependence between PFS and OS was 0.53. These associations were confirmed in the testing data set. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mRCC who were treated with interferon-alpha with or without bevacizumab, the PFS at 3 months and 6 months was found to be predictive of OS. A high dependence between PFS and OS was observed, suggesting that PFS may be used as a surrogate endpoint for OS. Although this is a novel observation for RCC, these findings require validation in patients with mRCC who are treated with other targeted agents.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Rini, Brian', 'Escudier, Bernard', 'Stadler, Walter M', 'Small, Eric J']","['Halabi S', 'Rini B', 'Escudier B', 'Stadler WM', 'Small EJ']","['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; Alliance Statistical and Data Center, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131008,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bevacizumab', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Endpoint Determination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC3869105,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/05/14 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28221 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Jan 1;120(1):52-60. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28221.

Although a significant amount of research has been conducted to elucidate the role of PKR signaling in the cytosol, only recently has attention been paid to the role of PKR in the nuclear compartment. Previously our group reported that phosphorylated forms of PKR are present in the nucleus of acute leukemic cell lines, representing a reservoir of active kinase that responds to stress. Using the CCRF-CEM acute T-cell leukemia cell line, a PKR-specific inhibitor, co-immunoprecipitation and a proteomics approach, which included affinity purified mass spectrometry analysis (AP/MS), we identified the proteins present in active and inactive PKR nuclear complexes. Of the proteins identified in the PKR complexes, sixty-nine (69) were specific to the active complex, while thirty-eight (38) were specific to the inactive complex. An additional thirteen (13) proteins associated specifically with both complexes. The majority of the proteins identified are involved in, ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, mRNA stability, gene expression, cell cycle, or chromatin organization, including several with known significance to normal hematopoiesis and/or hematological disease. In agreement with the AP/MS data, basal- or over-expression of PKR under normal growth conditions favored cell proliferation in the tested cell lines, whereas pharmacological inhibition of PKR or shRNA-mediated knock-down did not. PKR was also found to influence the isoform and the level of expression of the proto-oncogene MYC.","['Blalock, William L', 'Piazzi, Manuela', 'Bavelloni, Alberto', 'Raffini, Mirco', 'Faenza, Irene', ""D'Angelo, Antonietta"", 'Cocco, Lucio']","['Blalock WL', 'Piazzi M', 'Bavelloni A', 'Raffini M', 'Faenza I', ""D'Angelo A"", 'Cocco L']","['CNR-NationalResearch Council of Italy, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Bologna, Italy; SC Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'eIF-2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24529 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2014 Aug;229(8):1047-60. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24529.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We found that depletion of Dido1 in mouse ES cells led to differentiation, and ectopic expression of Dido1 inhibited differentiation induced by leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal. We further demonstrated that whereas Nanog and Oct4 could occupy the Dido1 locus and promote its transcription, Dido1 could also target to the loci of pluripotency factors such as Nanog and Oct4 and positively regulate their expression.

Although stomach cancer patients have the highest incidence of cachexia, few experimental models for the study of stomach CC have been established. Herein, we developed stomach CC animal models using nude rats subcutaneously implanted with two novel cell lines, i.e., MKN45c185, established from the human stomach cancer cell line MKN-45, and 85As2, derived from peritoneal dissemination of orthotopically implanted MKN45c185 cells in mice. Both CC models showed marked weight loss, anorexia, reduced musculature and muscle strength, increased inflammatory markers, and low plasma albumin levels; however, CC developed earlier and was more severe in rats implanted with 85As2 than in those implanted with MKN45cl85. Moreover, human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a known cachectic factor, and hypothalamic orexigenic peptide mRNA levels increased in the models, whereas hypothalamic anorexigenic peptide mRNA levels decreased. Surgical removal of the tumor not only abolished cachexia symptoms but also reduced plasma LIF levels to below detectable limits. Importantly, oral administration of rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, substantially ameliorated CC-related anorexia and body composition changes. In summary, our novel peritoneal dissemination-derived 85As2 rat model developed severe cachexia, possibly caused by LIF from cancer cells, that was ameliorated by rikkunshito. This model should provide a useful tool for further study into the mechanisms and treatment of stomach CC.","['Terawaki, Kiyoshi', 'Sawada, Yumi', 'Kashiwase, Yohei', 'Hashimoto, Hirofumi', 'Yoshimura, Mitsuhiro', 'Suzuki, Masami', 'Miyano, Kanako', 'Sudo, Yuka', 'Shiraishi, Seiji', 'Higami, Yoshikazu', 'Yanagihara, Kazuyoshi', 'Kase, Yoshio', 'Ueta, Yoichi', 'Uezono, Yasuhito']","['Terawaki K', 'Sawada Y', 'Kashiwase Y', 'Hashimoto H', 'Yoshimura M', 'Suzuki M', 'Miyano K', 'Sudo Y', 'Shiraishi S', 'Higami Y', 'Yanagihara K', 'Kase Y', 'Ueta Y', 'Uezono Y']","['Division of Cancer Pathophysiology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131217,United States,Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,American journal of physiology.

In this study, the global promoter methylation profile was determined in highly purified B-cells from 37 (Binet stage A) CLL patients, using high-resolution methylation microarrays (27,578 CpG). Overall, the methylation pattern correlated with the major biological (ZAP-70 and CD38), and molecular (IGHV mutation) markers, distinguishing CLL cases according to IGHV mutational status. Cell adhesion molecules were enriched in the signature of unmutated (UM) versus mutated (M-) CLL. Moreover, in M-CLL CpG hyper-methylation in three genes, including SPG20, was significantly anti-correlated with the corresponding gene expression level. Finally, the correlation between the methylation pattern and clinical parameters was investigated. Notably, out of 42 methyl-probes that were significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS), hyper-methylation of SPG20 was also positively associated with PFS. These data support the notion that epigenetic changes have clinical impact in CLL and may contribute to the identification of novel candidate disease-associated genes potentially useful to predict the clinical outcome of early stage CLL patients.","['Ronchetti, Domenica', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Matis, Serena', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Kwee, Ivo', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Ronchetti D', 'Tuana G', 'Rinaldi A', 'Agnelli L', 'Cutrona G', 'Mosca L', 'Fabris S', 'Matis S', 'Colombo M', 'Gentile M', 'Recchia AG', 'Kwee I', 'Bertoni F', 'Morabito F', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","['Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131218,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Aged', 'CpG Islands', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Prognosis', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transcriptome']",,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/10/03 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22139 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Mar;53(3):264-73. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22139.

Membrane organization influences many of the unique cellular functions and is strongly correlated, among other factors, to the membrane lipid composition; it may be evaluated by following up the membrane fluidity and aggregation properties of the platelet. In this study, we evaluated the platelet aggregation, the expression of platelet surface receptors, the membrane fluidity (as evaluated by fluorescence anisotropy) and its correlation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). It was found that the patients in accelerated and blastic phase of CML present an altered platelet aggregation response to all reagents except for ristocetin as compared with chronic phase group, which shows only epinephrine-altered response. We also found that BCR/ABL transcript leads to higher levels of ROS in accelerated and blastic CML phases. Patients without molecular remission have lower platelet membrane fluidity. We obtained a positive correlation between ROS level and membrane fluorescence anisotropy changes. The CD41 expression was decreased in CML patients and P selectin expression was found to be higher in these patients than in healthy volunteers. Platelets of CML patients have altered aggregation parameters in accelerated and blastic phases, in which BCR/ABL transcript level is increased. The increased level of ROS in CML patients without molecular remission is associated with a decrease in fluidity of platelet membrane and expression of CD41/CD61 receptors. These findings may contribute to understanding the mechanism of the altered platelet response reported in CML patients.","['Popov, Viola M', 'Vladareanu, Ana M', 'Bumbea, Horia', 'Kovacs, Eugenia', 'Moisescu, Mihaela-Georgeta', 'Onisai, Minodora', 'Iordache, Maria-Minodora', 'Savopol, Tudor']","['Popov VM', 'Vladareanu AM', 'Bumbea H', 'Kovacs E', 'Moisescu MG', 'Onisai M', 'Iordache MM', 'Savopol T']","['aDepartment of Hematology, Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest bDepartment of Hematology, County Emergency Hospital Arges, Pitesti cDepartment of Biophysics and Cell Biotechnology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Platelet Aggregation/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MBC.0b013e328365776f [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2014 Mar;25(2):142-50. doi: 10.1097/MBC.0b013e328365776f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, primary patient samples, and murine primary xenografts are very sensitive to treatment with the selective BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199. In primary patient cells, the median IC50 was approximately 10 nmol/L, and cell death occurred within 2 hours. Our ex vivo sensitivity results compare favorably with those observed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease for which ABT-199 has demonstrated consistent activity in clinical trials. Moreover, mitochondrial studies using BH3 profiling demonstrate activity at the mitochondrion that correlates well with cytotoxicity, supporting an on-target mitochondrial mechanism of action. Our protein and BH3 profiling studies provide promising tools that can be tested as predictive biomarkers in any clinical trial of ABT-199 in AML.","['Pan, Rongqing', 'Hogdal, Leah J', 'Benito, Juliana M', 'Bucci, Donna', 'Han, Lina', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Debose, Lakeisha', 'Mu, Hong', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Golfman, Leonard S', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Harutyunyan, Karine G', 'Hu, Jianhua', 'Leverson, Joel D', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Newman, Rachel', 'Park, Eugene', 'Ruvolo, Peter P', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Ryan, Jeremy', 'Schindela, Sonja', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Letai, Anthony G']","['Pan R', 'Hogdal LJ', 'Benito JM', 'Bucci D', 'Han L', 'Borthakur G', 'Cortes J', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Debose L', 'Mu H', 'Dohner H', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Galinsky I', 'Golfman LS', 'Haferlach T', 'Harutyunyan KG', 'Hu J', 'Leverson JD', 'Marcucci G', 'Muschen M', 'Newman R', 'Park E', 'Ruvolo PP', 'Ruvolo V', 'Ryan J', 'Schindela S', 'Zweidler-McKay P', 'Stone RM', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M', 'Letai AG']","['Departments of 1Leukemia, 2Pediatrics, and 3Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; 4Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School; 5Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts; 6The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; 7AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois; and 8Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California; 9Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm; 10MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131217,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3975047,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-13-0609 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0609 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2014 Mar;4(3):362-75. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0609.

In this study, neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of leukoencephalopathy were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy (P9605) versus those receiving fewer CNS-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation (P9201). A total of 66 children from 16 Pediatric Oncology Group institutions with ""standard-risk"" acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, without evidence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis were enrolled on ACCL0131: 28 from P9201 and 38 from P9605. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed >/=2.6 years after the end of treatment. Significantly more P9605 patients developed leukoencephalopathy compared with P9201 patients (68%, 95% confidence interval 49%-83% vs. 22%, 95% confidence interval 5%-44%; P=0.001) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment. Overall, 40% of patients scored <85 on either Verbal or Performance IQ. Children on both studies had significant attention problems, but P9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on P9201 (82%, 14/17 measures vs. 24%, 4/17 measures). This supports ongoing concerns about intensive MTX exposure as a major contributor to CNS late effects.","['Duffner, Patricia K', 'Armstrong, Floyd Daniel', 'Chen, Lu', 'Helton, Kathleen J', 'Brecher, Martin L', 'Bell, Beverly', 'Chauvenet, Allen R']","['Duffner PK', 'Armstrong FD', 'Chen L', 'Helton KJ', 'Brecher ML', 'Bell B', 'Chauvenet AR']","[""*Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo School of Medicine parallelDepartment of Pediatrics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and Holtz Children's Hospital, Miami, FL double daggerStatistics and Data Center, Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA section signDepartment of Radiological Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN paragraph signDepartment of Pediatrics, Georgia Health Science Center, Augusta, GA #Department of Pediatrics, West Virginia University Health Science Center, Charleston, WV.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Leukoencephalopathies/*chemically induced/epidemiology/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4465396,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000000 [doi]', '00043426-201401000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jan;36(1):8-15. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000000.,,,,,"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98543-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS694088'],,,"['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Aug;36(6):501.

Although uncommon among pediatric hematologic malignancies, both de novo and secondary MDS occur in children and may be the first presentation of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. Unlike its adult counterpart, pediatric MDS is more frequently associated with hypocellular bone marrow and monosomy 7. Refractory cytopenia is more typical than refractory anemia, as seen in the elderly.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the immunotherapeutic concepts underlying allo-SCT as well as the traditional dissection of the immune system into innate and adaptive arms need substantial refinement. More and more cell types migrate into the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, creating new terms such as innate-like lymphocytes. These innate-like cells, which include natural killer (NK) cells and gammadeltaT cells, could provide unique advantages to therapeutic interventions aimed at treating hematological malignancies, including protection against tumor relapse and viral infections without causing harmful graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Recent molecular and conceptual insights into these subpopulations have opened new avenues to exploit their exciting features for the development of new compounds and to revisit current therapeutic standards in the treatment of hematological cancers. This review therefore aims to discuss the rapid progress in the understanding of molecular mechanisms by which NK cells and gammadeltaT cells recognize malignancies and viral infections, and the value of this increasing knowledge to complement the battle against life-threatening complications of current strategies to treat cancer.","['Scheper, W', 'Grunder, C', 'Straetemans, T', 'Sebestyen, Z', 'Kuball, J']","['Scheper W', 'Grunder C', 'Straetemans T', 'Sebestyen Z', 'Kuball J']","['Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20131218,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology/metabolism']",,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013378 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.378 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1181-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.378.

In this study, we describe a cross-sectional analysis of 24 patients and 6 relatives with 14 different frameshift or substitution mutations of GATA2. A pattern of dendritic cell, monocyte, B, and natural killer (NK) lymphoid deficiency (DCML deficiency) with elevated Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) was observed in all 20 patients phenotyped, including patients with Emberger syndrome, monocytopenia with Mycobacterium avium complex (MonoMAC), and MDS. Four unaffected relatives had a normal phenotype indicating that cellular deficiency may evolve over time or is incompletely penetrant, while 2 developed subclinical cytopenias or elevated Flt3L. Patients with GATA2 mutation maintained higher hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets and were younger than controls with acquired MDS and wild-type GATA2. Frameshift mutations were associated with earlier age of clinical presentation than substitution mutations. Elevated Flt3L, loss of bone marrow progenitors, and clonal myelopoiesis were early signs of disease evolution. Clinical progression was associated with increasingly elevated Flt3L, depletion of transitional B cells, CD56(bright) NK cells, naive T cells, and accumulation of terminally differentiated NK and CD8(+) memory T cells.

BM-MSCs were successfully loaded with MV ex vivo, and MV was amplified intracellularly, without toxicity. Live cell confocal imaging demonstrated a viral hand-off between BM-MSCs and ALL targets in the presence of antibody. In a murine model of disseminated ALL, successful MV treatment (judged by bioluminescence quantification and survival) was completely abrogated by passive immunization with high-titer human anti-MV antibody.

The overall response rate was 17 of 43 patients (40%) at 3 to 4 months, including tri- and bilineage responses. The majority of patients who remained on eltrombopag in an extension study (14/17) continued to show improvement, and 7 eventually had significant increases in neutrophil, red cell, and platelet lineages. Five patients with robust near-normalization of blood counts had drug discontinued at a median of 28.5 months after entry (range, 9-37 months), and all maintained stable counts a median of 13 months (range, 1-15 months) off eltrombopag.

MBL has also been identified in donated blood, but no systematic study of blood donors has been reported. Using sensitive and specific laboratory methods, we detected MBL in 149 (7.1%; 95% confidence interval, 6.0% to 8.3%) of 2098 unique donors ages 45 years or older in a Midwestern US regional blood center between 2010 and 2011. Most of the 149 donors had low-count MBL, including 99 chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like (66.4%), 22 atypical (14.8%), and 19 CD5(-) (12.8%) immunophenotypes. However, 5 donors (3.4%) had B-cell clonal counts above 500 cells per microL, including 3 with 1693 to 2887 cells per microL; the clone accounted for nearly all their circulating B cells. Four donors (2.7%) had 2 distinct MBL clones. Of 51 MBL samples in which immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH)V-D-J genotypes could be determined, 71% and 29% used IGHV3- and IGHV4-family genes, respectively.

One possibility is that differences in the abundance of proteins change signaling outputs because these proteins compete for binding to hub proteins at critical network branch points. Focusing on the ErbB signaling, we created a protein interaction network that included information about protein domains and analyzed the role of competing protein interactions. By leveraging three-dimensional protein structures to infer steric interactions among binding partners for a common binding domain or linear motif (node) and including information about protein abundance and interaction affinities, we identified a large number of competitive, mutually exclusive (XOR) protein interactions. Modeling changes in protein abundance with different patterns of partner proteins and XOR nodes (XOR motifs) revealed that each motif conferred a different response. We experimentally investigated the XOR motif containing the hub protein Ras and its binding partners RIN1 (Ras and Rab interactor 1) and CRAF (v-raf-leukemia viral oncogene 1). Consistent with the computational prediction, overexpression of RIN1 in cultured cells decreased the phosphorylation of CRAF and its downstream targets. Thus, our analyses provide evidence that variation in the abundance of proteins that compete for binding to XOR nodes could contribute to context-specific signaling plasticity.","['Kiel, Christina', 'Verschueren, Erik', 'Yang, Jae-Seong', 'Serrano, Luis']","['Kiel C', 'Verschueren E', 'Yang JS', 'Serrano L']","['1European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Centre for Genomic Regulation Systems Biology Research Unit, Dr. Aiguader Street 88, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131217,United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbB)'],IM,"['Models, Molecular', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbB/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', '*Signal Transduction']",,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['6/306/ra109 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.2004560 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2013 Dec 17;6(306):ra109. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2004560.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: AMH levels are already compromised in girls at the time of cancer diagnosis compared with healthy girls. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In women diagnosed with cancer, evidence of reduced ovarian function has been described even before treatment has started. In girls with newly diagnosed cancer, no data are available. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed an age-matched case-control study in girls with newly diagnosed cancer. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We determined serum AMH levels in a cohort of 208 girls with newly diagnosed cancer, up to 18 years of age at diagnosis, and compared them with AMH levels of 250 age-matched healthy girls. The diagnoses included were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, nephroblastoma, sarcoma and neuroblastoma. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median age was 6.6 years (range 0.0-17.4), comparable with that in the control group (median 6.3 years, range 0.3-18.0). Girls with childhood cancer presented with significantly lower serum AMH levels compared with healthy age-matched controls (standard deviation scores (SDS) -0.8, P < 0.001). Median AMH level in patients was 1.4 mug/l (0.1-10.2) versus 3.0 mug/l (0.1-18.3) in controls. Specifically, 84% of all patients had AMH levels below the 50th percentile of normal AMH levels, and 19% below the 10th percentile. Surrogate markers of general health status (temperature, C-reactive protein and haemoglobin levels at diagnosis) were significantly correlated with AMH SDS. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Some caution is warranted because AMH levels increase with age in healthy children but the cases and controls were age-matched in our study. Although our sample size was large, additional studies are still required in an independent cohort. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study shows that AMH levels are reduced in girls with newly diagnosed cancer even before the cancer treatment has started. AMH levels correlate with impairment of general health status in girls. Therefore, besides (pre) antral follicle number, other factors may influence serum AMH levels. Longitudinal studies during and after childhood cancer are currently being performed in order to evaluate possible ovarian recovery after discontinuation of treatment.

Case studies].,61-70,,"INTRODUCTION: Gingival enlargement is a common form of periodontal tissue reaction to several irritating factors. The most common form is the drug related gingival hyperplasia--nevertheless the heredity gingival fibromatosis and hematological cases can also occur and might impose a challenge to periodontists. After a short literature summary three Case reports are presented. The first case is a drug related gingival overgrowth in a young kidney transplant women who took Cyclosporin-A. The excessive mass of fibrotic tissue was removed by a series of internal beveled incision and the oral and buccal gingival flaps were united with sutures. The healing was uneventful and during the follow up patient's compliance and oral hygiene was superb. The second case is a very severe antihypertensive drug related gingival overgrowth in a 62 years old man interfering with the closure of his lip and corrected with a combination of conventional gingivectomy and internal reverse beveled incision both and Ca-channel blockers. The third case is a 42 years old woman with chronic idiopathic hemolytic anemia who presented a sudden onset acute excessive generalized gingival enlargement accompanied with severe pain and fever. At admission she was suspect for leukemia. After obtaining biopsy samples and having negative histology the soft tissue mass was removed under general anesthesia with conventional gingivectomy technique, but after a couple of days the severe pain and gingival swelling recurred. With administering systemic corticosteroid therapy (32 mg Medrol), the gingiva healed in five days and the one year follow-up showed a stable hematological and periodontal status. Today the more conservative internal beveled incision is preferred over the conventional gingivectomy in the most cases because it provides a more predictable healing and better esthetics. The recurrence of the drug related gingival hyperplasia can be anticipated by meticulous postoperative individual oral hygiene and regular supportive therapy. CONCLUSION: The combined conservative and surgical therapy leads to predictable postoperative result even in very severe systematically motivated gingival enlargements, nevertheless the successful patients management needs good cooperation with medical doctors and with the patients themselves.","['Csifo-Nagy, Boroka', 'Hulik, Emese', 'Zsoldos, Geza Marton', 'Gera, Istvan']","['Csifo-Nagy B', 'Hulik E', 'Zsoldos GM', 'Gera I']","['Semmelweis Egyetem, Parodontologiai Klinika, Budapest.', 'Semmelweis Egyetem, Parodontologiai Klinika, Budapest.', 'Semmelweis Egyetem, Parodontologiai Klinika, Budapest.', 'Semmelweis Egyetem, Parodontologiai Klinika, Budapest.']",['hun'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Hungary,Fogorv Sz,Fogorvosi szemle,0374613,"['0 (Antihypertensive Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/complications', 'Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Gingival Hyperplasia/chemically induced/complications/*etiology/*surgery', 'Gingival Hypertrophy/chemically induced/complications/*etiology/*surgery', '*Gingivectomy/methods', 'Granuloma/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Pain/etiology', 'Suppuration', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/12/19 06:00,2014/01/16 06:00,['2013/12/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Fogorv Sz. 2013 Jun;106(2):61-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Extrem meretu iatrogen eredetu inyhiperplaziak sebeszi korrekcioja.

However, detection of such epitopes is hampered by self-tolerance and limitations in the sensitivity of mass spectrometry. Here, we used T cells from HLA-A2-negative donors as tools to detect HLA-A2-bound peptides from two leukemia-associated differentiation antigens; CD20 and the previously undescribed cancer target myeloperoxidase. A high-throughput platform for epitope discovery was designed using dendritic cells cotransfected with full-length transcripts of self-TAA and HLA-A2 to allow presentation of all naturally processed peptides from a predefined self-protein on foreign HLA. Antigen-reactive T cells were directly detected using panels of color-coded peptide-HLA multimers containing epitopes predicted by a computer algorithm. Strikingly, cytotoxic T cells were generated against 37 out of 50 peptides predicted to bind HLA-A2. Among these, 36 epitopes were previously undescribed. The allorestricted T cells were exquisitely peptide- and HLA-specific and responded strongly to HLA-A2-positive leukemic cells with endogenous expression of CD20 or myeloperoxidase. These results indicate that the repertoire of self-peptides presented on HLA class I has been underestimated and that a wealth of self-TAA can be targeted by T cells when using nontolerized T-cell repertoires.","['Kumari, Shraddha', 'Walchli, Sebastien', 'Fallang, Lars-Egil', 'Yang, Weiwen', 'Lund-Johansen, Fridtjof', 'Schumacher, Ton N', 'Olweus, Johanna']","['Kumari S', 'Walchli S', 'Fallang LE', 'Yang W', 'Lund-Johansen F', 'Schumacher TN', 'Olweus J']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, N-0310 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131216,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Autoantigens/chemistry', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Immunotherapy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Peroxidase/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology']",PMC3890872,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1306549111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1306549111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 7;111(1):403-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1306549111.

Mechanistically, PML-RARa acts as a transcriptional repressor of RARa and non-RARa target genes and antagonizes the formation and function of PML nuclear bodies that regulate numerous signaling pathways. The empirical discoveries that PML-RARa-associated APL is sensitive to both all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), and the subsequent understanding of the mechanisms of action of these drugs, have led to efforts to understand the contribution of molecular events to APL cell differentiation, leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) clearance, and disease eradication in vitro and in vivo. Critically, the mechanistic insights gleaned from these studies have resulted not only in a better understanding of APL itself, but also carry valuable lessons for other malignancies.","['Dos Santos, Guilherme Augusto', 'Kats, Lev', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Dos Santos GA', 'Kats L', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center; and 2 Department of Medicine and 3 Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/chemistry', 'Remission Induction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/chemistry']",PMC3865469,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20131121 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20131121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2013 Dec 16;210(13):2793-802. doi: 10.1084/jem.20131121.,,,,,"['R01 CA142874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA142874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA142780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA102142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this trial was to explore the impact of differential delayed intensification (DI) on outcome in all risk groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this trial, 5,060 eligible patients were divided into three risk groups according to age, WBC, early treatment response, and unfavorable genetic aberrations. DI was randomized as follows: standard risk (SR), two 4-week intensive elements (protocol III) versus one 7-week protocol II; intermediate risk (IR), protocol III x 3 versus protocol II x 1; high risk (HR), protocol III x 3 versus either protocol II x 2 (Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica [AIEOP] option), or 3 HR blocks plus single protocol II (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster [BFM] option). RESULTS: At 5 years, the probabilities of event-free survival and survival were 74% (+/- 1%) and 82% (+/- 1%) for all 5,060 eligible patients, 81% and 90% for the SR (n = 1,564), 75% and 83% for the IR (n = 2,650), and 55% and 62% for the HR (n = 846) groups, respectively. No improvement was accomplished by more intense and/or prolonged DI. CONCLUSION: The ALL IC-BFM 2002 trial is a good example of international collaboration in pediatric oncology. A wide platform of countries able to run randomized studies in ALL has been established. Although the alternative DI did not improve outcome compared with standard treatment and the overall results are worse than those achieved by longer established leukemia groups, the national results have generally improved.","['Stary, Jan', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Campbell, Myriam', 'Castillo, Luis', 'Dibar, Eduardo', 'Donska, Svetlana', 'Gonzalez, Alejandro', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Janic, Dragana', 'Jazbec, Janez', 'Konja, Josip', 'Kaiserova, Emilia', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Li, Chi-Kong', 'Magyarosy, Edina', 'Popa, Alexander', 'Stark, Batia', 'Jabali, Yahia', 'Trka, Jan', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Riehm, Hansjorg', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Schrappe, Martin']","['Stary J', 'Zimmermann M', 'Campbell M', 'Castillo L', 'Dibar E', 'Donska S', 'Gonzalez A', 'Izraeli S', 'Janic D', 'Jazbec J', 'Konja J', 'Kaiserova E', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Kovacs G', 'Li CK', 'Magyarosy E', 'Popa A', 'Stark B', 'Jabali Y', 'Trka J', 'Hrusak O', 'Riehm H', 'Masera G', 'Schrappe M']","[""Jan Stary, Jan Trka, and Ondrej Hrusak, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague; Yahia Jabali, Regional Hospital, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Martin Zimmermann and Hansjorg Riehm, Medical School Hannover, Hannover; Martin Schrappe, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany; Myriam Campbell, Roberto del Rio Hospital, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Luis Castillo, Hospital Pereira Rossell, Montevideo, Uruguay; Eduardo Dibar, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Svetlana Donska, Regional Oncologic Hospital, Kiev, Ukraine; Alejandro Gonzalez, Institute of Hematology and Immunology, La Habana, Cuba; Shai Izraeli, Sheba Medical Center of Israel, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Hashomer; Batia Stark, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Petah-Tikva, Israel; Dragana Janic, University Children's Hospital, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Janez Jazbec, University Children's Hospital, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Josip Konja, University Hospital Centre Rebro, Zagreb, Croatia; Emilia Kaiserova, University Children's Hospital, Bratislava, Slovakia; Jerzy Kowalczyk, University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland; Gabor Kovacs and Edina Magyarosy, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; Chi-Kong Li, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China; Alexander Popa, N.N.

We investigated whether, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), serum 2-HG would predict the presence of IDH1/2 mutations at diagnosis and provide a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 82 patients at diagnosis of de novo AML (IDH1/2 mutated, n = 53) and 68 patients without AML were analyzed for total 2-HG and its ratio of D to L stereoisomers by mass spectrometry. We measured 2-HG levels and molecular markers of MRD (WT1 and NPM1) in serial samples of 36 patients with IDH1/2 mutations after induction therapy. RESULTS: In patients with AML with IDH1/2 mutations, 2-HG serum levels were significantly higher than in patients with IDH1/2 wild type (P < .001). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 99%. The optimum diagnostic cutoff between IDH1/2 mutated and normal was 2 mumol/L (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 79%). Quantification of the D/L stereoisomers increased specificity (100%; 95% CI, 83% to 100%) compared with total 2-HG (P = .031). In patients with IDH2 R172 mutations, 2-HG levels were higher relative to those with other IDH1/2 mutations (P < .05). During follow-up, serum 2-HG levels showed strong positive correlation with WT1 and NPM1 (P < .001). After induction therapy, total 2-HG serum levels < 2 mumol/L were associated with better overall (P = .008) and disease-free survival (P = .005). CONCLUSION: Serum 2-HG is a predictor of the presence of IDH1/2 mutations and outcome in these patients. Discrimination between D/L stereoisomers improved specificity.","['Janin, Maxime', 'Mylonas, Elena', 'Saada, Veronique', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Quivoron, Cyril', 'Koscielny, Serge', 'Scourzic, Laurianne', 'Forget, Sebastien', 'Pautas, Cecile', 'Caillot, Denis', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Barouki, Robert', 'Rabier, Daniel', 'Auger, Nathalie', 'Griscelli, Frank', 'Chachaty, Elisabeth', 'Leclercq, Edwige', 'Courtier, Marie-Helene', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Solary, Eric', 'Bernard, Olivier Adrien', 'Penard-Lacronique, Virginie', 'Ottolenghi, Chris', 'de Botton, Stephane']","['Janin M', 'Mylonas E', 'Saada V', 'Micol JB', 'Renneville A', 'Quivoron C', 'Koscielny S', 'Scourzic L', 'Forget S', 'Pautas C', 'Caillot D', 'Preudhomme C', 'Dombret H', 'Berthon C', 'Barouki R', 'Rabier D', 'Auger N', 'Griscelli F', 'Chachaty E', 'Leclercq E', 'Courtier MH', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Solary E', 'Bernard OA', 'Penard-Lacronique V', 'Ottolenghi C', 'de Botton S']","[""Maxime Janin, Robert Barouki, Daniel Rabier, and Chris Ottolenghi, Biochimie Metabolique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Groupe Hospitalier Necker-Enfants Malades; Maxime Janin, Robert Barouki, and Chris Ottolenghi, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U747, Universite Paris Descartes; Herve Dombret, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris; Elena Mylonas, Cyril Quivoron, Laurianne Scourzic, Olivier Adrien Bernard, Virginie Penard-Lacronique, and Stephane de Botton, INSERM U985, Institut Gustave Roussy; Elena Mylonas, Cyril Quivoron, Laurianne Scourzic, Eric Solary, Olivier Adrien Bernard, and Virginie Penard-Lacronique, Institut Federatif de Recherche 54, Institut Gustave Roussy; Veronique Saada, Sebastien Forget, Nathalie Auger, Frank Griscelli, Elisabeth Chachaty, Edwige Leclercq, Marie-Helene Courtier, and Annelise Bennaceur-Griscelli, Institut Gustave Roussy; Jean-Baptiste Micol and Stephane de Botton, Hematologie Clinique, Institut Gustave Roussy; Serge Koscielny, Service de Biostatistique et d'Epidemiologie, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif; Elena Mylonas, Cyril Quivoron, Laurianne Scourzic, Olivier Adrien Bernard, Virginie Penard-Lacronique, Chris Ottolenghi, and Stephane de Botton, Universite Paris Sud-11, Orsay; Aline Renneville and Claude Preudhomme, Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire (CHRU) Lille; Celine Berthon, Hematologie Clinique, CHRU Lille, Lille; Cecile Pautas, Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Henri Mondor, Creteil; and Denis Caillot, Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Dijon, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131216,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glutarates)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

In this study, we identified ELL as a direct downstream target gene of E2F1. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that ELL interacted with E2F1 in vitro and in vivo, leading to inhibition of E2F1 transcriptional activity. In addition, ELL enhanced E2F1 deacetylation via recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Notably, the MLL-ELL fusion protein lost the inhibitory role of ELL in E2F1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, DNA damage induced ELL in an E2F1-dependent manner and ELL protected cells against E2F1-dependent apoptosis. Our findings not only connect ELL to E2F1 function and uncover a novel role of ELL in response to DNA damage but also provide an insight into the mechanism for MLL-ELL-associated leukemogenesis.","['Zhang, Wei', 'Ji, Wei', 'Liu, Xing', 'Ouyang, Gang', 'Xiao, Wuhan']","['Zhang W', 'Ji W', 'Liu X', 'Ouyang G', 'Xiao W']","[""The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131216,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics/physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics/physiology']",PMC3911481,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/03/22 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00878-13 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00878-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2014 Feb;34(4):765-75. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00878-13.

A robust data analysis strategy is required to determine protein quantification reliability, i.e. changes due to biological regulation rather than technical variation, so that proteins that are differentially expressed can be identified. METHODS: Samples were created by mixing 5, 10, 15 and 20 mug Escherichia coli cell lysate with 100 mug of cell lysate from mouse, corresponding to expected relative fold changes of one for mouse proteins and from 0.25 to 4 for E.coli proteins. Relative quantification was carried out using eight channel isobaric tagging with iTRAQ reagent, and proteins were identified using a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer. Technical variation inherent in this iTRAQ dataset was systematically investigated. RESULTS: A hierarchical statistical model was developed to use quantitative information at peptide level and protein level simultaneously to estimate variation present in each individual peptide and protein. A novel data analysis strategy for iTRAQ, denoted in short as WHATraq, was subsequently proposed with its performance evaluated by the proportion of E.coli proteins that are successfully identified as differentially expressed. Compared with two benchmark data analysis strategies WHATraq was able to identify at least 62.8% more true positive proteins that are differentially expressed. Further validated using a biological iTRAQ dataset including multiple biological replicates from varied murine cell lines, WHATraq performed consistently and identified 375% more proteins as being differentially expressed among different cell lines than the other data analysis strategies.","['Zhou, Cong', 'Walker, Michael J', 'Williamson, Andrew J K', 'Pierce, Andrew', 'Berzuini, Carlo', 'Dive, Caroline', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Zhou C', 'Walker MJ', 'Williamson AJ', 'Pierce A', 'Berzuini C', 'Dive C', 'Whetton AD']","['Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, CRUK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4BX, UK, Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Institute of Cancer Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester M20 3LJ, UK and Centre for Biostatistics, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131215,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Models, Statistical', 'Peptides/analysis/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/metabolism', 'Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staining and Labeling']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/05/17 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['btt722 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/btt722 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2014 Feb 15;30(4):549-58. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt722.

The purpose of this study was to present a recent history of establishing a valuable and reliable hospital- based cancer registry in a university hospital in Turkey, and the data gathered by this system in the last 9 years. METHODS: This study included the cancer registry records of Hacettepe University Hospitals between 1-Jan-2003, and 31-Dec-2011. The study cohort included data of 39351 cancer patients and the cancer registry system was based on active data acquisition method. RESULTS: Most frequent departments of reference were Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, General Surgery, Urology, and Pediatrics. The annual number of records gradually increased from 2675 in 2003 to 5152 in 2011. The 5 cancer types most frequency seen in adults were lung (15.5%), prostate (13.5%), stomach (6.6%), bladder (6.2%), and colon (5.8%) in men; and breast (32.7%), ovary (6.4%), uterine corpus (6.2%), uterine cervix (5.6%), and thyroid (5.0%) in women. Childhood cancers were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancers, 3rd Edition (ICCC-3), and the most frequent 5 cancer types in children were tumors of the central nervous system (20.1%), lymphomas (14.6%), leukemia (14.1%), retinoblastoma (9.4%), and tumors of the sympathetic nervous system (7.7%). CONCLUSION: Active data acquisition from departments that deal with oncologic patients in a hospital is the precise method for establishing a high-quality cancer registry system that is able to resemble the general population. Hospital- based cancer registry systems also provide highly critical information for planning, monitoring, and measuring the cancer-related services, research, and education.","['Kutluk, T', 'Mutlu Hayran, K', 'Kilickap, S', 'Yuce, D', 'Celik, I', 'Erman, M', 'Yalcin, S']","['Kutluk T', 'Mutlu Hayran K', 'Kilickap S', 'Yuce D', 'Celik I', 'Erman M', 'Yalcin S']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Program Development', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', 'Time Factors', 'Turkey/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/03/15 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2013 Oct-Dec;18(4):1088-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 378 samples from 55 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or multiple myeloma (MM) were investigated for clonotype identification, clonotype identity and comparability of MRD results. Forty-five clonotypes were identified by RQ-PCR and 49 by NGS. Clonotypes identified by both tools were identical or >97% homologous in 96% of cases. Both tools were able to routinely reach a sensitivity level of 1 x E-05. A good correlation of MRD results was observed (R=0.791, P<0.001), with excellent concordance in 79.6% of cases. Few discordant cases were observed across all disease subtypes. NGS showed at least the same level of sensitivity as allele-specific oligonucleotides-PCR, without the need for patient-specific reagents. We conclude that NGS is an effective tool for MRD monitoring in ALL, MCL and MM.

Identifying the genes that cooperate with or are required for the oncogenic activity of this chimeric transcription factor remains a major challenge. Our previous studies showed that Drosophila provides a genuine model to study how AML1-ETO promotes leukemia. Here, using an in vivo RNA interference screen for suppressors of AML1-ETO activity, we identified pontin/RUVBL1 as a gene required for AML1-ETO-induced lethality and blood cell proliferation in Drosophila. We further show that PONTIN inhibition strongly impaired the growth of human t(8;21)(+) or AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic blood cells. Interestingly, AML1-ETO promoted the transcription of PONTIN. Moreover, transcriptome analysis in Kasumi-1 cells revealed a strong correlation between PONTIN and AML1-ETO gene signatures and demonstrated that PONTIN chiefly regulated the expression of genes implicated in cell cycle progression. Concordantly, PONTIN depletion inhibited leukemic self-renewal and caused cell cycle arrest. All together our data suggest that the upregulation of PONTIN by AML1-ETO participate in the oncogenic growth of t(8;21) cells.","['Breig, O', 'Bras, S', 'Martinez Soria, N', 'Osman, D', 'Heidenreich, O', 'Haenlin, M', 'Waltzer, L']","['Breig O', 'Bras S', 'Martinez Soria N', 'Osman D', 'Heidenreich O', 'Haenlin M', 'Waltzer L']","['CNRS, CBD UMR5547, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, CBD (Centre de Biologie du Developpement), Batiment 4R3, 118 route de Narbonne, Toulouse, France.', 'CNRS, CBD UMR5547, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, CBD (Centre de Biologie du Developpement), Batiment 4R3, 118 route de Narbonne, Toulouse, France.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'CNRS, CBD UMR5547, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, CBD (Centre de Biologie du Developpement), Batiment 4R3, 118 route de Narbonne, Toulouse, France.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'CNRS, CBD UMR5547, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, CBD (Centre de Biologie du Developpement), Batiment 4R3, 118 route de Narbonne, Toulouse, France.', 'CNRS, CBD UMR5547, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, CBD (Centre de Biologie du Developpement), Batiment 4R3, 118 route de Narbonne, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RUVBL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RUVBL2 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics/growth & development', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013376 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.376 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1271-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.376.

Monitoring imatinib trough plasma concentration is a simple and rapid way to determine if the drug exposure exceeds the clinical efficacy threshold (1 mcg/mL). Because the target enzyme is located within cells, adequate drug intracellular concentrations are needed to inhibit its function. METHODS: Chromatographic methods were used to quantify imatinib concentrations in both plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from adult patients with chronic myeloid leukemia at the Department of Hematology. Samples were collected at steady state, and trough concentrations (24 +/- 2 hours after last drug intake) were evaluated. Associations between variables were tested using the Pearson test; results are presented as mean (+/-SD). RESULTS: Thirty-five samples from 24 patients were collected; patients were mainly men (16, 66.7%), aged 60 years old (+/-13.1) and with a body mass index of 24.8 (+/-4.4). A positive and significant correlation (r = 0.203; P = 0.027) was found between imatinib plasma and intracellular concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The observed correlation between plasma and intracellular imatinib concentrations suggests that they may be used to monitor drug exposure and treatment efficacy.","['De Francia, Silvia', ""D'Avolio, Antonio"", 'Ariaudo, Alessandra', 'Pirro, Elisa', 'Piccione, Francesca', 'Simiele, Marco', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Calcagno, Andrea', 'Di Perri, Giovanni', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['De Francia S', ""D'Avolio A"", 'Ariaudo A', 'Pirro E', 'Piccione F', 'Simiele M', 'Fava C', 'Calcagno A', 'Di Perri G', 'Saglio G']","['*Department of Biological and Clinical Sciences, S.

OBJECTIVE: Cytogenetic and clinical risk factors were examined in UHR MM patients. METHODS: Consecutive MM patients (n = 168) were retrospectively screened for untreated, symptomatic MM between July 2008 and March 2011, including UHR (n = 35) and control (n = 60) patients with </= 12 or >12 month survival, respectively. Treatment outcomes; clinical, radiological, histological factors; and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-indicated cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) were compared. RESULTS: Included UHR patients exhibited lower median overall survival (OS) (5 vs. >24 months); overall response rates (ORRs) (31.4% vs. 83.3%); complete response (CR), near CR (nCR), or very good partial response (VGPR) (8.6% vs. 51.7%) (all P<0.001); and partial response (PR) (22.9% vs. 31.7%, P = 0.358). UHR patients exhibited more renal failure (54.3% vs. 28.3%), hypercalcemia (11.4% vs. 0), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (25.7% vs. 5%), secondary plasma cell leukemia (14.3% vs. 0), International Staging System (ISS) stage III (77.1% vs. 45%), and 1q21+ and 17p- (42.9% vs. 18.3%; 17.1% vs. 3.3%) (all P<0.05). >/= 3 CAs indicated poor survival (36.7% vs. 16.1%, P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis showed ISS stage and LDH correlated with UHR (P = 0.05 and P =0.01, respectively), and 1q21+ and 17p- were increased but non-significantly correlated with UHR (P = 0.15 and P = 0.2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Combined clinical and cytogenetic assessments optimally indicate UHR MM patients' prognosis, allowing earlier risk-adapted interventions.","['Zhuang, Junling', 'Da, Yi', 'Li, Hui', 'Han, Bing', 'Wan, Xia', 'Zhu, Tienan', 'Chen, Miao', 'Duan, Minghui', 'Xu, Ying', 'Zhao, Yongqiang', 'Shen, Ti', 'Wua, Yongji', 'Zhou, Daobin']","['Zhuang J', 'Da Y', 'Li H', 'Han B', 'Wan X', 'Zhu T', 'Chen M', 'Duan M', 'Xu Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Shen T', 'Wua Y', 'Zhou D']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing 100730, China.

But seldom case reports mentioned their finding in other contexts, mainly B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms such chronic lymphocytic leukemia or in reactive circumstances as multiple sclerosis undergoing natalizumab treatment. We aimed to check if some particular morphologic features were more specificaly linked to PPBL, reviewing blood films of series of patients affected by PPBL or harbouring binucleated lymphocytes whatever the diagnosis was. We found that binucleated cells in PPBL were heterogeneous but mostly midde-sized cells, asymetricaly bilobed with nucleoli, and with a moderately basophilic cytoplasm.

In the clinical setting, the cytotoxic drug bleomycin is currently used with electroporation (electrochemotherapy) for palliative treatment of tumors. Calcium electroporation offers several advantages over standard treatment options: calcium is inexpensive and may readily be applied without special precautions, as is the case with cytostatic drugs. Therefore, details on the use of calcium electroporation are essential for carrying out clinical trials comparing calcium electroporation and electrochemotherapy. METHODS: The effects of calcium electroporation and bleomycin electroporation (alone or in combination) were compared in three different cell lines (DC-3F, transformed Chinese hamster lung fibroblast; K-562, human leukemia; and murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma). Furthermore, the effects of electrical pulsing parameters and calcium compound on treatment efficacy were determined. RESULTS: Electroporation with either calcium or bleomycin significantly reduced cell survival (p<0.0001), without evidence of a synergistic effect. Cellular death following calcium or bleomycin treatment occurred at similar applied voltages, suggesting that similar parameters should be applied. At equimolar concentrations, calcium chloride and calcium glubionate resulted in comparable decreases in cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium electroporation and bleomycin electroporation significantly reduce cell survival at similar applied voltage parameters. The effect of calcium electroporation is independent of calcium compound. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study strongly supports the use of calcium electroporation as a potential cancer therapy and the results may aid in future clinical trials.","['Frandsen, Stine Krog', 'Gissel, Hanne', 'Hojman, Pernille', 'Eriksen, Jens', 'Gehl, Julie']","['Frandsen SK', 'Gissel H', 'Hojman P', 'Eriksen J', 'Gehl J']","['Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev Ringvej 75, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Building 1160, Ole Worms Alle 4, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.', 'Centre of Inflammation and Metabolism, Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev Ringvej 75, 2730 Herlev, Denmark; Department of Pathology, Naestved Sygehus, Ringstedgade 61, 4700 Naestved, Denmark.', 'Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev Ringvej 75, 2730 Herlev, Denmark.

METHODS: Leukemia cell line U937 cells were treated with different concentrations of astragalus (62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1 000 mug/mL). The U937 cells without astragalus treatment were used as the control group. The ability of cell proliferation was measured by MTT method. Flow cytometry was used to explore cell apoptosis. The cell morphology changes were observed under a fluorescent microscope by dyeing Hoechst33258. mRNA expression of c-myc and p27 in U937 cells which was exposed in 1 000 mug/mL astragalus after 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Various concentrations of astragalus injection inhibited U937 cell proliferation effectively compared with the control group (P<0.05). They also induced U937 cells apoptosis and the apoptosis rate reached to (63 +/- 4)% in the 1 000 mug/mL astragalus treatment group. mRNA expression level of c-myc was gradually declined and p27 mRNA expression was gradually increased with astragalus treatment time (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Astragalus injection may inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of leukemia cell line U937 in vitro. This contributes to down-regulation of c-myc expression and up-regulation of p27 expression.","['Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Yin, Bao-Hui', 'Li, Jian-Chang']","['Jia XH', 'Yin BH', 'Li JC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China. jiaxiuhong001@163.com.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,['147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Astragalus Plant', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'U937 Cells']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/06/06 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2013.12.023 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2013 Dec;15(12):1128-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain an insight into the molecular mechanisms and new biomarkers, microarray analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed mRNA critical for benzene hematotoxicity. RNA was extracted from four chronic benzene poisoning patients occupationally exposed to benzene, three benzene-exposed workers without clinical symptoms and three health controls without benzene exposure and mRNA expression profiling was performed using Gene Chip Human Gene 2.0ST Arrays. Analysis of mRNA expression profiles were conducted to identify key genes, biological processes and pathways by the series test of cluster (STC), STC-Gene Ontology analysis (STC-GO), pathway analysis and Signal-net. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 1) 1661 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified and assigned to sixteen model profiles. 2) Profiles 14, 10, 11, 1 and 15 are the predominant expression profiles which were involved in immune response, inflammatory response, chemotaxis, defense response, anti-apoptosis and signal transduction. 3) The importance of immune response at benzene hematotoxicity is highlighted by several immune-related signaling pathways such as B/T cell receptor signaling pathway, acute myeloid leukemia, hematopoietic cell lineage and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity. 4) Signet analysis showed that PIK3R1, PIK3CG, PIK3R2, GNAI3, KRAS, NRAS, NFKB1, HLA-DMA, and HLA-DMB were key genes involved in benzene hematotoxicity. These genes might be new biomarkers for the prevention and early diagnosis of benzene poisoning.

It is now well established that AML cells can evade the immune system through multiple mechanisms, including the expression of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase. Immunotherapeutic strategies, including both active, such as vaccination with leukemia-associated antigens, and passive, such as adoptive transfer of allogeneic natural killer cells, may overcome leukemia escape and lead to improved cure. Allogeneic hemopoeitic stem cell transplantation, the most effective treatment of AML, is the best known model of immunotherapy. Following transplant, recipient AML cells are eradicated by donor immune cells through the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, GVL is clinically associated with graft-versus-host disease, the major cause of mortality after transplant. GVL is mediated by donor T cells recognizing either leukemia-associated antigens or minor as well as major histocompatibility antigens. Several innovative strategies have been devised to generate leukemia reactive T cells so as to increase GVL responses with no or little graft-versus-host disease.","['Arpinati, Mario', 'Curti, Antonio']","['Arpinati M', 'Curti A']","[""Department of Hematology & Oncological Sciences 'Seragnoli', University of Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Active/*methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Tumor Escape']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/30 06:00,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.13.152 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2014;6(1):95-106. doi: 10.2217/imt.13.152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the rarest of the three classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Polyploidy has only rarely been reported in MPN despite the prominent involvement of abnormal megakaryocytes. The use of peripheral blood samples containing increased numbers of haematopoietic progenitors has improved the output from cytogenetic studies in myelofibrosis and together with the use of single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNPa) has contributed to an improved knowledge regarding the diverse genetic landscape of this rare disease. RESULTS: Cytogenetic studies performed on a consecutive cohort of 42 patients with primary or post ET/PV myelofibrosis showed an abnormal karyotype in 24 cases and of these, nine showed a polyploid clone. Six of the nine cases showed a tetraploid (4n) subclone, whereas three showed mixed polyploid subclones with both tetraploid and octoploid (4n/8n) cell lines. The abnormal clone evolved from a near diploid karyotype at the initial investigation to a tetraploid karyotype in follow-up cytogenetic analysis in four cases. In total, six of the nine polyploid cases showed gain of 1q material. The remaining three cases showed polyploid metaphases, but with no detectable structural karyotypic rearrangements. Three of the nine cases showed chromosome abnormalities of 6p, either at diagnosis or later acquired. SNPa analysis on eight polyploid cases showed additional changes not previously recognised by karyotype analysis alone, including recurring changes involving 9p, 14q, 17q and 22q. Except for gain of 1q, SNPa findings from the polyploid group compared to eight non-polyploid cases with myelofibrosis found no significant differences in the type of abnormality detected. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the use of peripheral blood samples to be suitable for standard karyotyping evaluation and DNA based studies. The overall profile of abnormalities found were comparable with that of post-MPN acute myeloid leukaemia or secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and cases in the polyploidy group were associated with features of high risk disease. The above represents the first documented series of polyploid karyotypes in myelofibrosis and shows a high representation of gain of 1q.","['Singh, Nisha R', 'Morris, Christine M', 'Koleth, Mary', 'Wong, Kelly', 'Ward, Christopher M', 'Stevenson, William S']","['Singh NR', 'Morris CM', 'Koleth M', 'Wong K', 'Ward CM', 'Stevenson WS']","['Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. nsingh@nsccahs.health.nsw.gov.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131217,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC3906908,2013/12/18 06:00,2013/12/18 06:01,['2013/12/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-6-59 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-6-59 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2013 Dec 17;6(1):59. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-6-59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASES: We present 2 consecutive cases of leukemia comprising pleomorphic LGLs. One patient presented with drowsy consciousness and unstable hemodynamics. Her peripheral blood smear disclosed a significant number of LGLs with pleomorphic nuclei expressing CD2, CD56 and HLA-DR but not surface or cytoplasmic CD3 (cCD3). The second patient, previously healthy, presented with a sudden death. Her peripheral blood revealed LGLs ranging from round to pleomorphic nuclei with a CD2+ cCD3+ surface CD3- CD56+ phenotype and clonally rearranged T cell receptor gene. The findings of the first patient were consistent with ANKL and the second, T-LGLL. Both patients passed away shortly before treatment.

It is driven by multiple events, enhancing beta catenin stability and promoting its transcriptional co-activating function. We investigated the impact of BCR-ABL1 on Chibby1, a beta catenin antagonist involved in cell differentiation and transformation. Relative proximity of the Chibby1 encoding gene (C22orf2) on chromosome 22q12 to the BCR breakpoint (22q11) lets assume its involvement in beta catenin activation in chronic myeloid leukemia as a consequence of deletions of distal BCR sequences encompassing one C22orf2 allele. Forty patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were analyzed for C22orf2 relocation and Chibby1 expression. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses established that the entire C22orf2 follows BCR regardless of chromosomes involved in the translocation. In differentiated hematopoietic progenitors (bone marrow mononuclear cell fractions) of 30/40 patients, the expression of Chibby1 protein was reduced below 50% of the reference value (peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions of healthy persons). In such cell context, Chibby1 protein reduction is not dependent on C22orf2 transcriptional downmodulation; however, it is strictly dependent upon BCR-ABL1 expression because it was not observed at the moment of major molecular response under tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Moreover, it was not correlated with the disease prognosis or response to therapy. Most importantly, a remarkable Chibby1 reduction was apparent in a putative BCR-ABL1+ leukemic stem cell compartment identified by a CD34+ phenotype compared to more differentiated hematopoietic progenitors. In CD34+ cells, Chibby1 reduction arises from transcriptional events and is driven by C22orf2 promoter hypermethylation. These results advance low Chibby1 expression associated with BCR-ABL1 as a component of beta catenin signaling in leukemic stem cells.","['Leo, Elisa', 'Mancini, Manuela', 'Aluigi, Michela', 'Luatti, Simona', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Leo E', 'Mancini M', 'Aluigi M', 'Luatti S', 'Castagnetti F', 'Testoni N', 'Soverini S', 'Santucci MA', 'Martinelli G']","['Istituto di Ematologia ""Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli"", Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica Diagnostica e Sperimentale - DIMES, University of Bologna - Medical School, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CBY1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'beta Catenin/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3858264,2013/12/18 06:00,2015/03/03 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081425 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-28093 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 10;8(12):e81425. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081425. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These involve growing cells on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells or on gelatin in media supplemented with fetal bovine serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, these techniques have several drawbacks including the need for feeder-cells and/or use of undefined media containing animal derived components. Culture of stem cells under undefined conditions can induce spontaneous differentiation and reduce reproducibility of experiments. In recent years several new ES cell culture protocols, using more well-defined conditions, have been published and we have compared the standard culture protocols with two of the newly described ones: 1) growing cells in semi-adherence in a medium containing two small molecule inhibitors (CHIR99021, PD0325901) and; 2) growing cells in a spheroid suspension culture in a defined medium containing LIF and bFGF. Two feeder-dependent mouse ES (mES) cell lines and two cell lines adapted to feeder-independent growth were used in the study. The overall aim has not only been to compare self-renewal and differentiation capacity, but also ease-of-use and cost efficiency. We show that mES cells when grown adherently proliferate much faster than when grown in suspension as free-floating spheres, independent of media used. Although all the tested culture protocols could maintain sustained pluripotency after prolonged culturing, our data confirm previous reports showing that the media containing two chemical inhibitors generate more pure stem cell cultures with negligible signs of spontaneous differentiation as compared to standard mES media. Furthermore, we show that this medium effectively rescues and cleans up cultures that have started to deteriorate, as well as allow for effective adaption of feeder-dependent mES cell lines to be maintained in feeder-free conditions.","['Tamm, Christoffer', 'Pijuan Galito, Sara', 'Anneren, Cecilia']","['Tamm C', 'Pijuan Galito S', 'Anneren C']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Suspensions)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/economics/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gelatin/analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', 'Suspensions', 'Time Factors']",PMC3858223,2013/12/18 06:00,2015/03/03 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081156 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-22480 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 10;8(12):e81156. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081156. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, both PTEN rescue and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 treatment increase the PLZF expression in prostate cancer cell lines. Further, luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrate that FOXO3a, a transcriptional factor phosphorylated by PI3K/AKT, could directly bind to the promoter of PLZF gene.

However, it is difficult to ensure capture of targeted cells by these methods because capture depends on the probability of cell-micropillar collisions. We developed a new structure that actively exploits cellular flexibility for more efficient capture of a small number of cells in a target area. The depth of the sandwiching channel was slightly smaller than the diameter of the cells to ensure contact with the channel wall. For cell selection, we used anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule antibodies, which specifically bind epithelial cells. First, we demonstrated cell capture with human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, which are relatively homogeneous in size; in situ single molecule analysis was verified by our rolling circle amplification (RCA) method. Then, we used breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3) in blood, and demonstrated selective capture and cancer marker (HER2) detection by RCA.

Remarkably, these pro-B cell lines as well as primary bone marrow cells derived from ETV6/RUNX1 transgenic animals display elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as tested with ETV6/RUNX1 transgenic dihydroethidium staining. In line, intracellular phospho-histone H2AX flow cytometry and comet assay revealed increased DNA damage indicating that ETV6/RUNX1 expression enhances ROS. On the basis of our data, we propose the following model: the expression of ETV6/RUNX1 creates a preleukemic clone and leads to increased ROS levels. These elevated ROS favor the accumulation of secondary hits by increasing genetic instability and double-strand breaks, thus allowing preleukemic clones to develop into fully transformed leukemic cells.","['Kantner, Hans-Peter', 'Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Delogu, Alessio', 'Bauer, Eva', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Casanova, Emilio', 'Sexl, Veronika', 'Stoiber, Dagmar']","['Kantner HP', 'Warsch W', 'Delogu A', 'Bauer E', 'Esterbauer H', 'Casanova E', 'Sexl V', 'Stoiber D']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3858895,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/30 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.131310 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2013 Nov;15(11):1292-300. doi: 10.1593/neo.131310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FISH signals were comparable to conventional FISH, with 50-fold less probe consumption and 10-fold less time. Cells were immobilized in single file in channels just exceeding the diameter of the cells, and were used for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis. To test the micro-channels for application in FISH, MRD was simulated by mixing K562 cells (an established chronic myeloid leukemia cell line) carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene across 1:1 to 1:1,000 Jurkat cells (an established acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line). The limit of detection was seen to be 1:100 cells and 1:1,000 cells for FISHing lines and conventional FISH, respectively; however, the conventional method seemed to over-score the presence of K562 cells. This may in part be attributed to FISHing lines practically eliminating the chance of duplicate screening of cells and hastened the time of screening, enhancing scoring of all cells within the channels. This was compared to 1 in 500 cells on the slide being analyzed with the conventional FISH.","['Mughal, Farah', 'Baldock, Sara J', 'Karimiani, Ehsan Ghayoor', 'Telford, Nick', 'Goddard, Nicholas J', 'Day, Philip J R']","['Mughal F', 'Baldock SJ', 'Karimiani EG', 'Telford N', 'Goddard NJ', 'Day PJ']","['Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre, University of Manchester, Manchester, M1, 7ND, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131216,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Cell Size', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Microfluidics', 'Neoplasm, Residual']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/10/03 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22137 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Mar;53(3):255-63. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22137.

METHODS: Of the 789 consecutive patients with AML in CR1 who underwent RIC alloSCT from a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or matched unrelated donor peripheral stem cell grafts between 2001 and 2010, 591 patients received at least 1 cycle of consolidation chemotherapy and 198 patients did not receive any consolidation chemotherapy before alloSCT. To minimize inherent survival bias in favor of patients who underwent transplant long after achieving CR1, the study focused on 373 patients who underwent transplant within the median time frame between achievement of CR1 and alloSCT (3 months for patients who underwent alloSCT from matched siblings and 4 months for patients who underwent alloSCT from matched unrelated donors). In this subgroup, 151 patients did not receive any consolidation chemotherapy and 222 patients received >/= 1 consolidation chemotherapy cycle. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 2 months-135 months), the 3-year cumulative recurrence incidence (RI) was not significantly different between the groups (36% +/- 4% for the group treated without consolidation chemotherapy vs 38% +/- 3% for patients who received consolidation chemotherapy; P = .89). In addition, leukemia-free survival was similar between the groups (45% +/- 4% and 47% +/- 3%, respectively; P = .41). Dose intensity of cytarabine given during consolidation chemotherapy appeared to have no influence on RI. On multivariate analysis, pretransplant consolidation (>/= 1 cycle vs 0 cycles) was found to have no significant impact on RI (hazards ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.97 [P = .24]) or leukemia-free survival (hazards ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.42 [P = .99]). CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study suggest no apparent advantage for postremission consolidation chemotherapy before RIC alloSCT, provided a donor is readily available.","['Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Sengeloev, Henrik', 'Vindelov, Lars', 'Kuball, Juergen', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Bilger, Karin', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Yeshurun M', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Sengeloev H', 'Vindelov L', 'Kuball J', 'Chevallier P', 'Craddock C', 'Socie G', 'Bilger K', 'Schouten HC', 'Fegueux N', 'Goker H', 'Maertens J', 'Bunjes D', 'Arnold R', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Institute of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131210,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/prevention & control/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28498 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Mar 15;120(6):855-63. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28498.

Treatment of lymphoid neoplasms has traditionally been pursued with cytotoxic chemotherapy. To improve efficacy and ameliorate the adverse effects associated with classic chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy has been developed. At the forefront of clinical development is ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Btk is a protein tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in regulating B-cell signaling. Dysregulated Btk results in uncontrolled B-lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Ibrutinib is currently being studied in numerous malignancies of lymphoid origin including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Thus far, ibrutinib has demonstrated very promising results in treatment-naive patients as well as those with relapsed or refractory disease with an acceptable safety profile. In this article, we describe the pharmacology, efficacy, and toxicity profile of ibrutinib and depict the potential role that ibrutinib will play in the treatment paradigm of lymphoid neoplasms.","['Bhatt, Valkal', 'Alejandro, Linh', 'Michael, Angela', 'Ganetsky, Alex']","['Bhatt V', 'Alejandro L', 'Michael A', 'Ganetsky A']","['Department of Pharmacy, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131212,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1366 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2014 Mar;34(3):303-14. doi: 10.1002/phar.1366.

Several genetic variations in MTHFR gene as MTHFR-C677T and MTHFR-A1298C result in decreased MTHFR activity, which could influence efficient DNA methylation and explain susceptibility to different cancers. The etiology of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is obscure and little is known about individual's susceptibility to CML. In order to assess the influence of these genetic polymorphisms on the susceptibility to CML and its effect on the course of the disease among Egyptians, we performed an age-gender-ethnic matched case-control study. The study included 97 CML patients and 130 healthy controls. Genotyping of MTHFR-C677T and -A1298C was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. The results showed no statistical difference in the distribution of MTHFR-C677T and -A1298C polymorphic genotypes between CML patients and controls. The frequency of MTHFR 677-TT homozygous variant was significantly higher in patients with accelerated/blastic transformation phase when compared to those in the chronic phase of the disease. In conclusion, our study revealed that MTHFR-C677T and -A1298C polymorphisms could not be considered as genetic risk factors for CML in Egyptians. However, MTHFR 677-TT homozygous variant might be considered as a molecular predictor for disease progression.","['Khorshied, Mervat Mamdooh', 'Shaheen, Iman Abdel Mohsen', 'Abu Khalil, Reham E', 'Sheir, Rania Elsayed']","['Khorshied MM', 'Shaheen IA', 'Abu Khalil RE', 'Sheir RE']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, mervatkhorshied@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131213,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/ethnology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/07/26 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0794-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Jan;31(1):794. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0794-2.

Recent studies point to the microenvironment as the critical factor providing leukemic lymphocytes with pro-survival signals. Thus, the neighboring cells appear to be a perfect target for antileukemic therapy. Nurse-like cells (NLCs) largely contribute to CLL microenvironmental support. We developed the CLL lymphocyte/NLC co-culture model for the investigation of microenvironmental interactions. Viability and apoptosis were investigated in CLL lymphocytes treated with dexamethasone (DEX) and chlorambucil (CLB), with and without NLCs' support. For the first time, the capacity of DEX and CLB to affect NLCs viability was also evaluated. Apoptosis-associated gene expression profiles of leukemic lymphocytes ex vivo and cultured with NLCs were assessed by expression arrays. CLL lymphocytes escaped spontaneous apoptosis for several months when cultured with NLCs. The presence of NLCs significantly reduced apoptosis induced with DEX and CLB (p < 0.001; p = 0.012, respectively), and their protective effect was more evident than the effect of recombinant SDF1. Both DEX and CLB also decreased NLCs viability, but to a lesser extent (mean viability in DEX-treated cultures was 37.79% in NLCs compared to 29.24% in lymphocytes). NLCs induced the expression of important anti-apoptotic genes in cultured CLL lymphocytes; median expression of BCL2, SURVIVIN, BCL2A1, and XIAP was significantly higher as compared to ex vivo status. The CLL lymphocyte/NLC co-culture makes up the convenient and close to the natural-state model for studying the relationship between leukemic cells and the microenvironment. Direct cell-to-cell contact with NLCs increases the expression of anti-apoptotic genes in CLL lymphocytes, thus protecting them against induced apoptosis. As the effect of antileukemic drugs is not so apparent in NLCs, the combined therapy targeted at both lymphocytes and the microenvironment should be considered for CLL patients. Simultaneous aiming at the disruption of several different signaling pathways and/or anti-apoptotic proteins may further improve treatment efficiency.","['Filip, Agata A', 'Cisel, Bogumila', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, Ewa']","['Filip AA', 'Cisel B', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E']","['Department of Cancer Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Radziwillowska 11, 20-080, Lublin, Poland, aafilip@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131212,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bystander Effect/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/metabolism', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4308641,2013/12/18 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-013-0268-z [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2015 Feb;15(1):73-83. doi: 10.1007/s10238-013-0268-z.

We previously reported that ARC expression is a strong, independent adverse prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we investigated the regulation and role of ARC in AML. ARC expression is upregulated in AML cells co-cultured with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and suppressed by inhibition of MAPK and PI3K signaling. AML patient samples with RAS mutations (N = 64) expressed significantly higher levels of ARC than samples without RAS mutations (N = 371) (P = 0.016). ARC overexpression protected and ARC knockdown sensitized AML cells to cytarabine and to agents that selectively induce intrinsic (ABT-737) or extrinsic (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) apoptosis. NOD-SCID mice harboring ARC-overexpressing KG-1 cells had significantly shorter survival than mice injected with control cells (median 84 vs 111 days) and significantly fewer leukemia cells were present when NOD/SCID IL2Rgamma null mice were injected with ARC knockdown as compared to control Molm13 cells (P = 0.005 and 0.03 at 2 and 3 weeks, respectively). Together, these findings demonstrate that MSCs regulate ARC in AML through activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. ARC confers drug resistance and survival advantage to AML in vitro and in vivo, suggesting ARC as a novel target in AML therapy.","['Mak, P Y', 'Mak, D H', 'Mu, H', 'Shi, Y', 'Ruvolo, P', 'Ruvolo, V', 'Jacamo, R', 'Burks, J K', 'Wei, W', 'Huang, X', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Carter, B Z']","['Mak PY', 'Mak DH', 'Mu H', 'Shi Y', 'Ruvolo P', 'Ruvolo V', 'Jacamo R', 'Burks JK', 'Wei W', 'Huang X', 'Kornblau SM', 'Andreeff M', 'Carter BZ']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (activity regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3943601,2013/12/18 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0954-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2014 Apr;19(4):698-707. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0954-z.,,,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS549057'],,,,,,,,,,,,

(the blue-green herb) in the early 1970s, which has been confirmed for effectively treating malaria. Additionally, emerging data prove that artemisinin exhibits anti-cancer effects against many types of cancers such as leukemia, melanoma, etc. Artemisinin becomes cytotoxic in the presence of ferrous iron. Since iron influx is high in cancer cells, artemisinin and its analogs selectively kill cancer cells with increased intracellular iron concentrations. This study is aimed to investigate the selective inhibitory effects of artemisinin on SMMC-7721 cells in vitro and determine the effect of holotransferrin, which increases the concentration of ferrous iron in cancer cells, combined with artemisinin on the anticancer activity. MTT assay was used for assessing the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells treated with artemisinin. The induction of apoptosis and inhibition of colony formation in SMMC-7721 cells treated with artemisinin were determined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and colony formation assay, respectively. The results showed that artemisinin at various concentrations significantly inhibited growth, colony formation and cell viability of SMMC-7721 cells (P<0.05), likely due to induction of apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells. Of interest, it was found that incubation of artemisinin combined with holotransferrin sensitized the growth inhibitory effect of artemisinin on SMMC-7721 cells (P<0.01). Our data suggest that treatment with artemisinin leads to inhibition of viability and proliferation, and apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, we observed that holotransferrin significantly enhanced the anti-cancer activity of artemisinin.

Inflammasome components termed nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) proteins act as sensors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns, stress, or danger stimuli. We discovered that arsenicals, including arsenic trioxide and sodium arsenite, inhibited activation of the NLRP1, NLRP3, and NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasomes by their respective activating signals, anthrax lethal toxin, nigericin, and flagellin. These compounds prevented the autoproteolytic activation of caspase-1 and the processing and secretion of IL-1beta from macrophages. Inhibition was independent of protein synthesis induction, proteasome-mediated protein breakdown, or kinase signaling pathways. Arsenic trioxide and sodium arsenite did not directly modify or inhibit the activity of preactivated recombinant caspase-1. Rather, they induced a cellular state inhibitory to both the autoproteolytic and substrate cleavage activities of caspase-1, which was reversed by the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine but not by reducing agents or NO pathway inhibitors. Arsenicals provided protection against NLRP1-dependent anthrax lethal toxin-mediated cell death and prevented NLRP3-dependent neutrophil recruitment in a monosodium urate crystal inflammatory murine peritonitis model.

The present study aimed to explore the effect of As2O3 on the expression and regulation of P-gp in leukemia cells, and elucidate the mechanism of the reversal of drug resistance. In the present study, electrophoretic mobility shift assay results indicated that p65 binds to the NF-kappaB binding site of MDR1, specifically in K562/D cells. Expression of p65 and phosphorylated IkappaB was reduced, while the expression of IkappaB was increased in K562/D cells treated with As2O3. The activity of luciferase increased up to 9-fold with 40 ng/ml TNF-alpha, and it was suppressed by ~25% following treatment with 1 microM As2O3. These findings suggest that As2O3 reverses the P-gp-induced drug resistance of leukemia cells through the NF-kappaB pathway. As2O3 may inhibit the activity of phosphorylase to inhibit IkappaB phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB activity and MDR1 gene expression, leading to reversal of drug resistance.","['Gao, Feng', 'Liu, Jia', 'Dong, Wan Wei', 'Wang, Wei', 'Wang, Ying', 'Cai, Dali', 'Zheng, Zhihong', 'Sun, Kailai']","['Gao F', 'Liu J', 'Dong WW', 'Wang W', 'Wang Y', 'Cai D', 'Zheng Z', 'Sun K']","['Department of Genetics, China Medical University, Heping, Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, P.R.

CML is a comparatively well-characterized neoplasm, important for its own sake and useful for insights into other neoplasms. Here, Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) CML data are analyzed after considering possible misclassification of chronic myelo-monocytic leukemia as CML. For people older than 25 years, plots of male and female CML log incidences versus age at diagnosis are approximately parallel straight lines with males either above or to the left of females. This is consistent with males having a higher risk of developing CML or a shorter latency from initiation to diagnosis of CML. These distinct mechanisms cannot be distinguished using SEER data alone. Therefore, CML risks among male and female Japanese A-bomb survivors are also analyzed. The present analyses suggest that sex differences in CML incidence more likely result from differences in risk than in latency. The simplest but not the sole interpretation of this is that males have more target cells at risk to develop CML. Comprehensive mathematical models of CML could lead to a better understanding of the role of HSCs in CML and other preleukemias that can progress to acute leukemia.","['Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Jankovic, Gradimir M', 'Tiu, Ramon V', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Jackson, Robert C', 'Hlatky, Lynn R', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Sachs, Rainer K']","['Radivoyevitch T', 'Jankovic GM', 'Tiu RV', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Jackson RC', 'Hlatky LR', 'Gale RP', 'Sachs RK']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA, txr24@case.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20131213,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Nuclear Weapons', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data']",PMC3943788,2013/12/18 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-013-0507-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2014 Mar;53(1):55-63. doi: 10.1007/s00411-013-0507-4.

Aspects relevant for surgery using the example of a cholecystectomy].,327-33,10.1007/s00104-013-2642-5 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Systemic mast cell activation disease (MCAD) is characterized by an increased and unregulated release of mast cell mediators which can evoke a multifaceted clinical picture often resembling irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia. Because of the considerable prevalence (~ 17 %) of MCAD surgeons are frequently unwittingly confronted with MCAD patients in whom unexpected intraoperative and postoperative complications may occur. Therefore, knowledge of the particular requirements is of relevance for surgical treatment of MCAD patients. OBJECTIVE: The present paper outlines a concept of surgical treatment of MCAD patients based on the literature which is illustrated by a case report on emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high prevalence of MCAD in the general population it can be assumed that the frequency in the surgical patient population is similar. If a patient has MCAD, specific characteristics should be taken into account in the surgical procedure to avoid increased operative and complication risks resulting from MCAD.","['Sido, B', 'Dumoulin, F L', 'Homann, J', 'Hertfelder, H-J', 'Bollmann, M', 'Molderings, G J']","['Sido B', 'Dumoulin FL', 'Homann J', 'Hertfelder HJ', 'Bollmann M', 'Molderings GJ']","['Abteilung fur Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie, Haus St. Elisabeth, Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Bonn, Bonn, Deutschland.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Chirurg,Der Chirurg; Zeitschrift fur alle Gebiete der operativen Medizen,16140410R,['0 (Prescription Drugs)'],IM,"['*Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Emergencies', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Humans', 'Intraoperative Complications/*diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Middle Aged', 'Perioperative Care/methods', 'Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Prescription Drugs/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/12/18 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00104-013-2642-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Chirurg. 2014 Apr;85(4):327-33. doi: 10.1007/s00104-013-2642-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chirurgische Eingriffe an Patienten mit Mastzelluberaktivitatserkrankung.

In this study, we investigated whether the tumor-selective effect of depolarization was observed among different tumor cell types and the mechanisms by which depolarization potentiates death pathways. We found that K+ and KATP channel inhibitors elicited similar apoptosis-potentiating effects in human tumor cells with different origins, including leukemia, melanoma and lung cancer cells. In contrast, minimal potentiation of apoptosis was observed in non-transformed lung cells. The potentiation was associated with increased mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress death pathways. Upregulation of surface TRAIL receptor-2 expression and modulation of the caspase-3 activation pathway seemed to play roles in the enhancement of death signaling. Moreover, the results showed that depolarization and mitochondriaderived reactive oxygen species (mROS) mutually regulated one another. Depolarization potentiated TRAIL-induced mROS accumulation. Conversely, scavenging of mROS by the antioxidant MnTBaP reduced depolarization, whereas mROS accumulation caused by metabolic inhibitors potentiated the depolarization. These findings suggest a positive loop between depolarization and mROS accumulation. This may provide a rationale for the tumor-selective cytotoxicity and/or potentiation of TRAIL cytotoxicity of a wide variety of ROS-producing substances in different types of tumor cells.","['Suzuki-Karasaki, Miki', 'Ochiai, Toyoko', 'Suzuki-Karasaki, Yoshihiro']","['Suzuki-Karasaki M', 'Ochiai T', 'Suzuki-Karasaki Y']","['Department of Dermatology, Nihon University Surugadai Hospital, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Nihon University Surugadai Hospital, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.', 'Division of Physiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131210,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP12 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 12)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cardiolipins/chemistry', 'Caspase 12/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.2215 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Feb;44(2):616-28. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.2215.

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of Bmi1 in the maintenance of stemness properties and tumorigenicity of human bladder CSC-like side population (SP) cells. SP cells were sorted by flow cytometry using Hoechst 33342 staining. Bmi1 mRNA and protein expression in SP and non-SP (NSP) cells was analyzed by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. The stemness properties of SP cells included cell proliferation, migration, self-renewal, chemotherapy resistance and cell cycle progression were assessed. Tumor formation was also assessed in human bladder cancer xenografts after Bmi1 silencing. The mRNA expression of Bmi1 was upregulated in SP cells when compared with that in the NSP cells. Knockdown of Bmi1 in SP cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and tumor sphere formation, enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin, and cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Bmi1 knockdown inhibited cell cycle progression through derepression of the p16INK4a/p14ARF locus. Bmi1-siRNA SP cells failed to produce tumors in recipient mice, while typical urothelial carcinoma formed from subcutaneously injected scramble-siRNA SP cells. Bmi1 is crucial for the maintenance of stemness properties and tumorigenicity of human bladder CSC-like cells. Bmi1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the eradication of CSCs in bladder cancer.","['Zhu, Dingjun', 'Wan, Xuesi', 'Huang, Hai', 'Chen, Xu', 'Liang, Wu', 'Zhao, Fengjin', 'Lin, Tianxin', 'Han, Jinli', 'Xie, Wenlian']","['Zhu D', 'Wan X', 'Huang H', 'Chen X', 'Liang W', 'Zhao F', 'Lin T', 'Han J', 'Xie W']","['Department of Urology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, P.R.

MDS is considered a 'preleukemic' disorder linked to a significantly elevated risk of developing an overt acute leukemia. Cytopenias can be observed in all three myeloid lineages suggesting the involvement of multipotent, immature hematopoietic cells in the pathophysiology of this disease. Recent studies using murine models of MDS as well as primary patient-derived bone marrow samples have provided direct evidence that the most immature, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), as well as lineage-committed progenitor cells, are critically altered in patients with MDS. Besides significant changes in the number and distribution of stem as well as immature progenitor cells, genetic and epigenetic aberrations have been identified, which confer functional changes to these aberrant stem cells, impairing their ability to proliferate and differentiate. Most importantly, aberrant stem cells can persist and further expand after treatment, even upon transient achievement of clinical complete remission, pointing to a critical role of these cells in disease relapse. Ongoing preclinical and clinical studies are particularly focusing on the precise molecular and functional characterization of aberrant MDS stem cells in response to therapy, with the goal to develop stem cell-targeted strategies for therapy and disease monitoring that will allow for achievement of longer-lasting remissions in MDS.","['Elias, H K', 'Schinke, C', 'Bhattacharyya, S', 'Will, B', 'Verma, A', 'Steidl, U']","['Elias HK', 'Schinke C', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Will B', 'Verma A', 'Steidl U']","['1] Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA [2] Departments of Cell Biology and Developmental and Molecular Biology, New York, NY, USA [3] Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medicine (Oncology), New York, NY, USA [4] Ruth L. and David S.

To clarify the significance of the presence of immune systems in leukemia development, we transferred MLL/ENL leukemia cells into immune-competent or immune-deficient mice without any preconditioning including irradiation. The wild-type mice did not develop leukemia, whereas all the Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice lacking both adaptive immune cells and natural killer (NK) cells developed leukemia, indicating that leukemia cells were immunologically rejected. Interestingly, leukemia cells were also rejected in 60% of the Rag2(-/-) mice that lacked adaptive immune cells but possessed NK cells, suggesting that NK cells play a substantial role in the rejection of leukemia. Moreover, engraftment of leukemia cells was enhanced by NK cell depletion in Rag2(-/-) recipients and inhibited by transfer of NK cells into Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) recipients. Upregulation of NKG2D (NK group 2, member D) ligands in MLL/ENL leukemia cells caused elimination of leukemia cells by NK cells. Finally, we found that leukemia cells resistant to elimination by NK cells had been selected during leukemia development in Rag2(-/-) recipients. These results demonstrate that NK cells can eradicate MLL/ENL leukemia cells in vivo in the absence of adaptive immunity, thus suggesting that NK cells can play a potent role in immunosurveillance against leukemia.","['Nakata, J', 'Nakano, K', 'Okumura, A', 'Mizutani, Y', 'Kinoshita, H', 'Iwai, M', 'Hasegawa, K', 'Morimoto, S', 'Fujiki, F', 'Tatsumi, N', 'Nakajima, H', 'Nakae, Y', 'Nishida, S', 'Tsuboi, A', 'Oji, Y', 'Oka, Y', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Kumanogoh, A', 'Hosen, N']","['Nakata J', 'Nakano K', 'Okumura A', 'Mizutani Y', 'Kinoshita H', 'Iwai M', 'Hasegawa K', 'Morimoto S', 'Fujiki F', 'Tatsumi N', 'Nakajima H', 'Nakae Y', 'Nishida S', 'Tsuboi A', 'Oji Y', 'Oka Y', 'Sugiyama H', 'Kumanogoh A', 'Hosen N']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', '1] Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan [2] Department of Immunopathology, WP1 Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', '1] Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan [2] Department of Immunopathology, WP1 Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', '1] Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan [2] Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131113,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Klrk1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013374 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.374 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1316-25. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.374.

Here we report that TL-cell clones generate abundant eosinophils in a substantial fraction of patients. Sorted eosinophils from patients with TL and eosinophilia carried the same GATA1s mutations as sorted TL blasts, consistent with their clonal origin. TL blasts exhibited a genetic program characteristic of eosinophils and differentiated along the eosinophil lineage in vitro. Similarly, ectopic expression of Gata1s, but not Gata1, in wild-type CD34(+)-hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells induced hyperproliferation of eosinophil promyelocytes in vitro. Although GATA1s retained the function of GATA1 to induce eosinophil genes by occupying their promoter regions, GATA1s was impaired in its ability to repress oncogenic MYC and the pro-proliferative E2F transcription network. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) indicated reduced GATA1s occupancy at the MYC promoter. Knockdown of MYC, or the obligate E2F-cooperation partner DP1, rescued the GATA1s-induced hyperproliferative phenotype. In agreement, terminal eosinophil maturation was blocked in Gata1(Deltae2) knockin mice, exclusively expressing Gata1s, leading to accumulation of eosinophil precursors in blood and bone marrow. These data suggest a direct relationship between the N-terminal truncating mutations of GATA1 and clonal eosinophilia in DS patients.","['Maroz, A', 'Stachorski, L', 'Emmrich, S', 'Reinhardt, K', 'Xu, J', 'Shao, Z', 'Kabler, S', 'Dertmann, T', 'Hitzler, J', 'Roberts, I', 'Vyas, P', 'Juban, G', 'Hennig, C', 'Hansen, G', 'Li, Z', 'Orkin, S', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Klusmann, J-H']","['Maroz A', 'Stachorski L', 'Emmrich S', 'Reinhardt K', 'Xu J', 'Shao Z', 'Kabler S', 'Dertmann T', 'Hitzler J', 'Roberts I', 'Vyas P', 'Juban G', 'Hennig C', 'Hansen G', 'Li Z', 'Orkin S', 'Reinhardt D', 'Klusmann JH']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""1] Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA [3] Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""1] Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA [3] Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Oxford University Department of Paediatrics, Childrens Hospital and Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, UK.', '1] MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK [2] Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospital, NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.', '1] MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK [2] Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospital, NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Pediatric Pneumology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Pneumology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Division of Genetics, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""1] Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA [3] Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Down Syndrome/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Eosinophilia/etiology/*pathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4047213,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013373 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.373 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1259-70. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.373.

Here, we describe a novel mechanism by which hypoxia contributes to tumoral immune escape from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Exposure of human or murine cancer cells to hypoxia for 24 hours led to upregulation of the immune inhibitory molecule programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1; also known as B7-H1), in a manner dependent on the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). In vivo studies also demonstrated cellular colocalization of HIF-1alpha and PD-L1 in tumors. Hypoxia-induced expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells increased their resistance to CTL-mediated lysis. Using glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an agonist of nitric oxide (NO) signaling known to block HIF-1alpha accumulation in hypoxic cells, we prevented hypoxia-induced PD-L1 expression and diminished resistance to CTL-mediated lysis. Moreover, transdermal administration of GTN attenuated tumor growth in mice. We found that higher expression of PD-L1 induced in tumor cells by exposure to hypoxia led to increased apoptosis of cocultured CTLs and Jurkat leukemia T cells. This increase in apoptosis was prevented by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1, the PD-L1 receptor on T cells, or by addition of GTN. Our findings point to a role for hypoxia/HIF-1 in driving immune escape from CTL, and they suggest a novel cancer immunotherapy to block PD-L1 expression in hypoxic-tumor cells by administering NO mimetics.","['Barsoum, Ivraym B', 'Smallwood, Chelsea A', 'Siemens, D Robert', 'Graham, Charles H']","['Barsoum IB', 'Smallwood CA', 'Siemens DR', 'Graham CH']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Departments of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences and Urology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131213,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', 'G59M7S0WS3 (Nitroglycerin)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nitroglycerin/pharmacology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/04/16 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-0992 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0992 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Feb 1;74(3):665-74. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0992.

Consequently, they can miss up to 103-104 CTCs, resulting in the development of barely treatable metastasis. Here we analyze a new concept of in vivo CTC detection with enhanced sensitivity (up to 102-103 times) by the examination of the entire blood volume in vivo (5 L in adults). We focus on in vivo photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometry (PAFC) of CTCs using label-free or targeted detection, photoswitchable nanoparticles with ultrasharp PA resonances, magnetic trapping with fiber-magnetic-PA probes, optical clearance, real-time spectral identification, nonlinear signal amplification, and the integration with PAFC in vitro. We demonstrate PAFC's capability to detect rare leukemia, squamous carcinoma, melanoma, and bulk and stem breast CTCs and its clusters in preclinical animal models in blood, lymph, bone, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the release of CTCs from primary tumors triggered by palpation, biopsy or surgery, increasing the risk of metastasis. CTC lifetime as a balance between intravasation and extravasation rates was in the range of 0.5-4 h depending on a CTC metastatic potential. We introduced theranostics of CTCs as an integration of nanobubble-enhanced PA diagnosis, photothermal therapy, and feedback through CTC counting. In vivo data were verified with in vitro PAFC demonstrating a higher sensitivity (1 CTC/40 mL) and throughput (up to 10 mL/min) than conventional assays. Further developments include detection of circulating cancer-associated microparticles, and super-rsesolution PAFC beyond the diffraction and spectral limits.","['Galanzha, Ekaterina I', 'Zharov, Vladimir P']","['Galanzha EI', 'Zharov VP']","['Phillips Classic Laser and Nanomedicine Laboratories, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, 4301 West Markham Street, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA. zharovvladimirp@uams.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131210,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC3875961,2013/12/18 06:00,2013/12/18 06:01,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers5041691 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers5041691 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2013 Dec 10;5(4):1691-738. doi: 10.3390/cancers5041691.,,,,,"['R01 CA131164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB009230/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This diagnosis is contingent upon exclusion of underlying causes of reactive neutrophilia particularly if evidence of myeloid clonality is lacking. The lack of a specific molecular marker has left the diagnosis to be largely one of exclusion. Recently, the molecular landscape shifted with the discovery of specific oncogenic mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor gene (CSF3R) in CNL patients. We review the implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis and potential for new therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2013, oncogenic mutations in CSF3R were identified in a majority of patients with CNL and demonstrated that their downstream signalling was sensitive to known kinase inhibitors. This discovery was then validated with the demonstration of 100% CSF3R mutational frequency (predominately CSF3RT618I) in strictly WHO-defined CNL. Simultaneously, novel somatic mutations in SETBP1 were found to be enriched in CNL with possible prognostic significance. SUMMARY: CNL appears to be driven by specific somatic activating CSF3R mutations. These bestow susceptibility to known kinase inhibitors, opening the door to novel specific therapeutic options for CNL. The diagnosis of CNL will no longer be one only of exclusion, and revision of the current WHO diagnostic criteria is expected to include the molecular criterion of CSF3R mutation positivity.","['Elliott, Michelle A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Elliott MA', 'Tefferi A']","['aDepartment of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology bDepartment of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Chromosomes', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/therapy', 'Mutation']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000014 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Mar;21(2):148-54. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its exclusivity is reflected by both the clinical course and the management of patients. This article discusses 2 aspects of the unique management of patients with APL: the role of maintenance therapy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring. Despite common practice, the efficacy of maintenance therapy in APL is still debated, and the introduction of arsenic trioxide into frontline protocols makes this debate even more challenging. This article also attempts to clarify details regarding the type and duration of maintenance treatment. The presence of residual leukemic cells, seen using PCR analysis of the PML/RARalpha fusion gene product, in patients who have experienced a complete response has been shown to have a high correlation with subsequent relapse. This fact led to the broad use of PCR monitoring techniques in patients with APL. Practicing clinicians face several questions with regard to monitoring, such as what is the best technique for monitoring patients with APL, who can benefit the most from these tests, what are the best time points, and for how long is monitoring recommended. These questions are addressed in this article.","['Ganzel, Chezi', 'Douer, Dan', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Ganzel C', 'Douer D', 'Tallman MS']","['From the Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['11/12/1512 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2013.0178 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2013 Dec 1;11(12):1512-21. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2013.0178.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of berberine induced p53-independent apoptosis remain unclear. METHODS: The p53-null leukemia cell line EU-4 cells were exposed to berberine. Then the cell viability and apoptosis were determined. Western blot and PCR were employed to detect the expression of apoptosis related protein, XIAP and MDM2. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was applied to knock down endogenous expression of MDM2 and XIAP. RESULTS: Berberine induced p53-independent, XIAP-mediated apoptotic cell death in p53-null leukemia cells. Treatment with berberine resulted in suppression of XIAP protein in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Berberine induced down-regulation of XIAP protein involving inhibition of MDM2 expression and a proteasome-dependent pathway. Moreover, inhibition of XIAP by berberine or siRNA increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings characterize the molecular mechanisms of berberine-induced caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis, and berberine may be a novel candidate inducer of apoptosis in leukemia cells, which normally lack p53 expression.","['Liu, Jian', 'Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Liu, Aiguo', 'Liu, Shuangyou', 'Zhang, Liuqing', 'Wu, Bei', 'Hu, Qun']","['Liu J', 'Zhang X', 'Liu A', 'Liu S', 'Zhang L', 'Wu B', 'Hu Q']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan P.R.

Patients (n = 846) received nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, or imatinib 400 mg once daily. At 3 months, more patients had EMR failure (ie, BCR-ABL(IS) >10%) on imatinib (33%) than on nilotinib (9%-11%); similarly at 6 months, 16% of patients in the imatinib arm vs 3% and 7% in the nilotinib arms had EMR failure. In all arms, EMR failure was associated with lower rates of molecular response, an increased risk of progression, and lower overall survival compared with EMR achievement. We also analyzed patient and treatment characteristics associated with EMR and found distinct patterns in the nilotinib arms vs the imatinib arm. High Sokal risk score was associated with a high rate of EMR failure on imatinib, but not on nilotinib. In contrast, reduced dose intensity and dose interruptions were strongly associated with EMR failure in nilotinib-treated, but not imatinib-treated, patients.

However, unexpected disease progression is observed in some cases. In a cohort of untreated CD38- CLL patients with normal FISH or isolated 13q- we found that, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 16/28 cases presented, within immunomagnetic sorted CD38+ cells, genetic lesions undetectable in the CD38- fraction. These patients showed a shorter time to first treatment (TTFT, p=0.0162) in comparison to cases without FISH lesions in CD38+ cells. Patients with FISH abnormalities in CD38+ cells showed a distinctive microRNA profile, characterized by the down-regulation of miR-125a-5p both in the CD38- and CD38+ populations. In an independent cohort of 71 consecutive untreated CD38- CLL with normal FISH or isolated 13q-, a lower miR125a-5p expression was associated with a shorter TTFT both in univariate and multivariate analysis (p=0.003 and 0.016, respectively) and with a higher prevalence of mutations (7/12 vs 0/8, p=0.015) as assessed by next-generation sequencing. In conclusion, our data showed previously unrecognized subclonal heterogeneity within the CD38+ fraction of CD38- CLL patients with low-risk FISH findings and suggested an association between down-regulated miR-125a-5p expression, genetic complexity and worse outcome.","['Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Saccenti, Elena', 'Rizzotto, Lara', 'Ferracin, Manuela', 'Martinelli, Sara', 'Formigaro, Luca', 'Cibien, Francesca', 'Cavallari, Maurizio', 'Lista, Enrico', 'Daghia, Giulia', 'Sofritti, Olga', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Lupini, Laura', 'Bassi, Cristian', 'Zagatti, Barbara', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Cuneo, Antonio']","['Rigolin GM', 'Saccenti E', 'Rizzotto L', 'Ferracin M', 'Martinelli S', 'Formigaro L', 'Cibien F', 'Cavallari M', 'Lista E', 'Daghia G', 'Sofritti O', 'Ciccone M', 'Cavazzini F', 'Lupini L', 'Bassi C', 'Zagatti B', 'Negrini M', 'Cuneo A']","['Hematology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, University Hospital Arcispedale S.

Here we show that MYCN is overexpressed in a relevant proportion (40 to 50%) of adult and pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). Focusing on pediatric T-ALL, MYCN-expressing samples were found almost exclusively in the TAL1-positive subgroup. Moreover, TAL1 knockdown in T-ALL cell lines resulted in a reduction of MYCN expression, and TAL1 directly binds to MYCN promoter region, suggesting that TAL1 pathway activation could sustain the up-regulation of MYCN. The role of MYCN in T-ALL was investigated by peptide nucleic acid (PNA-MYCN)-mediated transcriptional silencing of MYCN and by siRNAs. MYCN knockdown in T-ALL cell lines resulted in a reduction of cell viability, up to 50%, while no effect was elicited with a mismatch PNA. The inhibitory effect of PNA-MYCN on cell viability was due to a significant increase in apoptosis. PNA-MYCN treatment in pediatric T-ALL samples reduced cell viability of leukemic cells from patients with high MYCN expression, while no effect was obtained in MYCN-negative blast cells. These results showed that MYCN is frequently overexpressed in pediatric T-ALL and suggested his role as a candidate for molecularly-directed therapies.","['Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Vendemini, Francesca', 'Urbini, Milena', 'Melchionda, Fraia', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Franzoni, Monica', 'Libri, Virginia', 'Serravalle, Salvatore', 'Togni, Marco', 'Paone, Giuseppina', 'Montemurro, Luca', 'Bressanin, Daniela', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Tonelli, Roberto', 'Pession, Andrea']","['Astolfi A', 'Vendemini F', 'Urbini M', 'Melchionda F', 'Masetti R', 'Franzoni M', 'Libri V', 'Serravalle S', 'Togni M', 'Paone G', 'Montemurro L', 'Bressanin D', 'Chiarini F', 'Martelli AM', 'Tonelli R', 'Pession A']","['""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3960194,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1337 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.1337 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Jan 15;5(1):120-30. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.1337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutralizing antibodies against HCMV confer significant protection against infection, and glycoprotein B (gB) is a major target of such neutralizing antibodies. However, one shortcoming of past HCMV vaccines may have been their failure to induce high-titer persistent neutralizing antibody responses that prevent the infection of epithelial cells. We used enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs), in which particles were produced in cells after the expression of murine leukemia virus (MLV) viral matrix protein Gag, to express either full-length CMV gB (gB eVLPs) or the full extracellular domain of CMV gB fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein (gB-G eVLPs). gB-G-expressing eVLPs induced potent neutralizing antibodies in mice with a much greater propensity toward epithelial cell-neutralizing activity than that induced with soluble recombinant gB protein. An analysis of gB antibody binding titers and T-helper cell responses demonstrated that high neutralizing antibody titers were not simply due to enhanced immunogenicity of the gB-G eVLPs. The cells transiently transfected with gB-G but not gB plasmid formed syncytia, consistent with a prefusion gB conformation like those of infected cells and viral particles. Two of the five gB-G eVLP-induced monoclonal antibodies we examined in detail had neutralizing activities, one of which possessed particularly potent epithelial cell-neutralizing activity. These data differentiate gB-G eVLPs from gB antigens used in the past and support their use in a CMV vaccine candidate with improved neutralizing activity against epithelial cell infection.","['Kirchmeier, Marc', 'Fluckiger, Anne-Catherine', 'Soare, Catalina', 'Bozic, Jasminka', 'Ontsouka, Barthelemy', 'Ahmed, Tanvir', 'Diress, Abebaw', 'Pereira, Lenore', 'Schodel, Florian', 'Plotkin, Stanley', 'Dalba, Charlotte', 'Klatzmann, David', 'Anderson, David E']","['Kirchmeier M', 'Fluckiger AC', 'Soare C', 'Bozic J', 'Ontsouka B', 'Ahmed T', 'Diress A', 'Pereira L', 'Schodel F', 'Plotkin S', 'Dalba C', 'Klatzmann D', 'Anderson DE']","['VBI Vaccines, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131211,United States,Clin Vaccine Immunol,Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,101252125,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Cytomegalovirus Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein B, Simplexvirus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/virology', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology/metabolism']",PMC3910943,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/09/18 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CVI.00662-13 [pii]', '10.1128/CVI.00662-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2014 Feb;21(2):174-80. doi: 10.1128/CVI.00662-13.

Bcr-Abl-T315I is the predominant mutation that causes resistance to imatinib, cytotoxic drugs, and the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The emergence of imatinib resistance in patients with CML leads to searching for novel approaches to the treatment of CML. Gambogic acid, a small molecule derived from Chinese herb gamboges, has been approved for phase II clinical trial for cancer therapy by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this study, we investigated the effect of gambogic acid on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells bearing Bcr-Abl-T315I or wild-type Bcr-Abl. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CML cell lines (KBM5, KBM5-T315I, and K562), primary cells from patients with CML with clinical resistance to imatinib, and normal monocytes from healthy volunteers were treated with gambogic acid, imatinib, or their combination, followed by measuring the effects on cell growth, apoptosis, and signal pathways. The in vivo antitumor activity of gambogic acid and its combination with imatinib was also assessed with nude xenografts. RESULTS: Gambogic acid induced apoptosis and cell proliferation inhibition in CML cells and inhibited the growth of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-T315I xenografts in nude mice. Our data suggest that GA-induced proteasome inhibition is required for caspase activation in both imatinib-resistant and -sensitive CML cells, and caspase activation is required for gambogic acid-induced Bcr-Abl downregulation and apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an alternative strategy to overcome imatinib resistance by enhancing Bcr-Abl downregulation with the medicinal compound gambogic acid, which may have great clinical significance in imatinib-resistant cancer therapy.","['Shi, Xianping', 'Chen, Xin', 'Li, Xiaofen', 'Lan, Xiaoying', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Liu, Shouting', 'Huang, Hongbiao', 'Liu, Ningning', 'Liao, Siyan', 'Song, Wenbin', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Wang, Shunqing', 'Xu, Li', 'Wang, Xuejun', 'Dou, Q Ping', 'Liu, Jinbao']","['Shi X', 'Chen X', 'Li X', 'Lan X', 'Zhao C', 'Liu S', 'Huang H', 'Liu N', 'Liao S', 'Song W', 'Zhou P', 'Wang S', 'Xu L', 'Wang X', 'Dou QP', 'Liu J']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, Departments of Pathophysiology and Biochemistry, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong; Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Guangxi Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, China; Division of Basic Biomedical Sciences, Sanford School of Medicine of the University of South Dakota, Vermillion, South Dakota; and The Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, and Departments of Oncology, Pharmacology and Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131212,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Xanthones)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8N585K83U2 (gambogic acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Monocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3938960,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1063 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1063 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Jan 1;20(1):151-63. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1063.

Therapeutic inhibition of microRNA-21 and microRNA-196b inhibited in vitro leukemic colony forming activity and depleted in vivo leukemia-initiating cell activity of HOX-based leukemias, which led to leukemia-free survival in a murine AML model and delayed disease onset in xenograft models.

However, patients with high-risk leukemia have a substantial risk of relapse early after transplantation, at a time when administration of donor lymphocytes has a high likelihood of resulting in graft-versus-host disease, disturbing a favorable balance between the graft-versus-leukemia effect and graft-versus-host disease. New therapeutic modalities are, therefore, required to allow early administration of T cells capable of exerting a graft-versus-leukemia effect without causing graft-versus-host disease. Here we describe the isolation of virus-specific T cells using Streptamer-based isolation technology and subsequent transfer of the minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1-specific T-cell receptor using retroviral vectors. Isolation of virus-specific T cells and subsequent transduction with HA-1-T-cell receptor resulted in rapid in vitro generation of highly pure, dual-specific T cells with potent anti-leukemic reactivity. Due to the short production procedure of only 10-14 days and the defined specificity of the T cells, administration of virus-specific T cells transduced with the HA-1-T-cell receptor as early as 8 weeks after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is feasible.

Here we show overexpression of PDK1 in over 40% of myelomonocytic acute leukemia patients. Overexpression of PDK1 occurred uniformly throughout the leukemic population, including putative leukemia-initiating cells. Clinical outcome analysis revealed PDK1 overexpression was associated with poorer treatment outcome. Primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts over-expressing PDK1 showed improved in vitro survival and ectopic expression of PDK1 promoted the survival of myeloid cell lines. Analysis of PDK1 target kinases revealed that PDK1 overexpression was most closely associated with increased phosphorylation of PKC isoenzymes and inhibition of PKC strongly inhibited the survival advantage of PDK1 over-expressing cells. Membrane localization studies implicated PKCalpha as a major target for PDK1 in this disease. PDK1 over-expressing blasts showed differential sensitivity to PDK1 inhibition (in the low micromolar range) suggesting oncogene addiction, whilst normal bone marrow progenitors were refractory to PDK1 inhibition at effective inhibitor concentrations. PDK1 inhibition also targeted subpopulations of leukemic blasts with a putative leukemia-initiating cell phenotype. Together these data show that overexpression of PDK1 is common in acute myelomonocytic leukemia and is associated with poorer treatment outcome, probably arising from the cytoprotective function of PDK1. We also show that therapeutic targeting of PDK1 has the potential to be both an effective and selective treatment for these patients, and is also compatible with current treatment regimes.","['Zabkiewicz, Joanna', 'Pearn, Lorna', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Morgan, Rhys G', 'Tonks, Alex', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Darley, Richard L']","['Zabkiewicz J', 'Pearn L', 'Hills RK', 'Morgan RG', 'Tonks A', 'Burnett AK', 'Darley RL']",['zabkiewiczj1@cardiff.ac.uk.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131213,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (PDK1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase']",PMC4008098,2013/12/18 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.096487 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.096487 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 May;99(5):858-64. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.096487.

Although promising new therapies for this incurable disease are being tested in clinical trials, the therapeutic relevance of metabolic rewiring in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify targetable metabolic differences in primary CLL lymphocytes by the use of Dasatinib. Dasatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is being tested in clinical trials for several cancers including CLL. This drug has been shown to be beneficial to CML patients suffering from diabetes by reducing their glucose plasma levels. In keeping with this previous observation, we report that Dasatinib induced glucose use while reducing lactate production, suggesting that this tyrosine kinase inhibitor decreases aerobic glycolysis and shifts glucose use in primary CLL lymphocytes. Our results suggest that primary CLL lymphocytes (independently of traditional prognostic factors) can be stratified in two subsets by their sensitivity to Dasatinib in vitro. Increased glucose use induced by Dasatinib or by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was not sufficient to sustain survival and ATP levels in CLL samples sensitive to Dasatinib. The two subsets of primary CLL lymphocytes are characterized as well by a differential dependency on mitochondrial respiration and the use of anabolic or catabolic processes to cope with induced metabolic/energetic stress. Differential metabolic reprogramming between subsets is supported by the contrasting effect on the survival of Dasatinib treated CLL lymphocytes with pharmacological inhibition of two master metabolic regulators (mTorc1 and AMPK) as well as induced autophagy. Alternative metabolic organization between subsets is further supported by the differential basal expression (freshly purified lymphocytes) of active AMPK, regulators of glucose metabolism and modulators of AKT signaling. The contrasting metabolic features revealed by our strategy could be used to metabolically target CLL lymphocyte subsets creating new therapeutic windows for this disease for mTORC1 or AMPK inhibitors. Indeed, we report that Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes was selectively cytotoxic to Dasatinib sensitive samples. Ultimately, we suggest that a similar strategy could be applied to other cancer types by using Dasatinib and/or relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Martinez Marignac, Veronica L', 'Smith, Sarah', 'Toban, Nader', 'Bazile, Miguel', 'Aloyz, Raquel']","['Martinez Marignac VL', 'Smith S', 'Toban N', 'Bazile M', 'Aloyz R']","['McGill University, Lady Davis Institute and Segal Cancer Center, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (TIGAR protein, human)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Lactic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3926848,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1508 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.1508 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2013 Dec;4(12):2550-66. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.1508.,,,,,['MOP 106528/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flk2 (Flt3) in promoting myeloid development remains poorly defined, despite being commonly mutated in acute myeloid leukemia. We investigated the effect of Flk2 deficiency on myelopoiesis, focusing on specification of progenitors between HSC and mature cells. We provide evidence that Flk2 is critical for proliferative expansion of multipotent progenitors that are common precursors for all lymphoid and myeloid lineages, including megakaryocyte/erythroid (MegE) cells. Flk2 deficiency impaired the generation of both lymphoid and myeloid progenitors by abrogating propagation of their common upstream precursor. At steady state, downstream compensatory mechanisms masked the effect of Flk2 deficiency on mature myeloid output, whereas transplantation of purified progenitors revealed impaired generation of all mature lineages. Flk2 deficiency did not affect lineage choice, thus dissociating the role of Flk2 in promoting cell expansion and regulating cell fate.

This survival advantage was attributed to reduced cell cycling and proliferation of progenitors in Flk2-deficient mice.

However, this procedure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to high rates of infection and the toxicity of graft versus host disease (GVHD). One of the principle aims of cellular immunotherapy is to target the malignant cells without damaging the other tissues of the body. T lymphocytes offer the opportunity to do this, due to the exquisite specificity that they exhibit as part of the adaptive immune response. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are lymphocytes that have been genetically modified to express the antigen binding component of an immunoglobulin molecule coupled to T-cell signaling domains. The use of an immunoglobulin molecule eliminates MHC restriction, enabling the same CAR to be used for several different patients and increasing the feasibility of widespread clinical use. They can be constructed to target a huge range of antigens, allowing the targeting of cancer cells with unprecedented levels of specificity. The addition of co-stimulatory domains to the CAR construct has enhanced the efficacy and durability of these T cells, which are under investigation in several clinical trials. The early results from these trials have been very encouraging with dramatic responses being observed in heavily pre-treated patients with otherwise poor risk disease.","['Riches, John C', 'Gribben, John G']","['Riches JC', 'Gribben JG']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, John Vane Science Centre, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/chemistry', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen/chemistry', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/07 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2013 Dec;16(90):295-302.,,,,,['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to investigate miR-223 regulation in HCC. METHODS: miR-223 and integrin alphaV dysregulation were verified in 57 HCC specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis of integrin alphaV and sulfatide levels was performed on another cohort of 103 HCC samples. Epigenetic analysis was used to explore the effect of sulfatide on miR-223 transcription. Orthotopic growth, and intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis of tumors derived from SMMC-7721 cells expressing miR-223 or cerebroside sulfotransferase were monitored in mice. RESULTS: miR-223 was reduced in HCC specimens and highly metastatic cell lines. Enhanced miR-223 expression had a negative effect on integrin alphaV-mediated cell migration. In vivo assays of metastasis in an orthotopically implanted model demonstrated that miR-223 effectively inhibited HCC metastasis. Further analysis demonstrated that integrin alphaV is negatively regulated by miR-223. Moreover, the integrin alphaV subunit was significantly positively correlated with highly expressed sulfatide in 103 HCC specimens. Intriguingly, miR-223 expression was suppressed by sulfatide in HCC in association with reduced recruitment of acetylated histone H3 and C/EBPalpha to the pre-miR-223 gene promoter, where monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ) protein, a MYST-type histone acetyltransferase, lost its attachment. The expression of histone deacetylases, HDAC9 and HDAC10, were greatly stimulated by sulfatide and their recruitment to miR-223 gene promoter was enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of miR-223 in HCC is associated with the epigenetic regulation by highly expressed sulfatide and involved in tumor metastasis.","['Dong, Yi Wei', 'Wang, Rong', 'Cai, Qian Qian', 'Qi, Bing', 'Wu, Wei', 'Zhang, Yong Hu', 'Wu, Xing Zhong']","['Dong YW', 'Wang R', 'Cai QQ', 'Qi B', 'Wu W', 'Zhang YH', 'Wu XZ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Key Lab of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Key Lab of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Key Lab of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Key Lab of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Key Lab of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Shanghai, China.', ""People's Hospital of Beilun District, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Key Lab of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Shanghai, China.

We found that BPTES only suppressed the growth of AML cells expressing mutant IDH compared with those expressing wild type IDH.

We found that PRMT4, a type I arginine methyltransferase whose function in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is unknown, is overexpressed in acute myelogenous leukemia patient samples. Overexpression of PRMT4 blocks the myeloid differentiation of human stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), whereas its knockdown is sufficient to induce myeloid differentiation of HSPCs. We demonstrated that PRMT4 represses the expression of miR-223 in HSPCs via the methylation of RUNX1, which triggers the assembly of a multiprotein repressor complex that includes DPF2. As part of the feedback loop, PRMT4 expression is repressed posttranscriptionally by miR-223. Depletion of PRMT4 results in differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and their decreased proliferation in vivo. Thus, targeting PRMT4 holds potential as a novel therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Vu, Ly P', 'Perna, Fabiana', 'Wang, Lan', 'Voza, Francesca', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Tempst, Paul', 'Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye', 'Gao, Rui', 'Chen, Sisi', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Deblasio, Tony', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Liu, Yan', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Vu LP', 'Perna F', 'Wang L', 'Voza F', 'Figueroa ME', 'Tempst P', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Gao R', 'Chen S', 'Paietta E', 'Deblasio T', 'Melnick A', 'Liu Y', 'Zhao X', 'Nimer SD']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Gerstner Sloan-Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Molecular Biology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Biology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Cancer Center, Montefiore Medical Center-North Division, Bronx, NY 10466, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Oncology Division, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.

These checkpoints might include effects of programmed cell death 1 (PD1), a co-inhibitory receptor that impairs T-cell function and is highly expressed on intratumoral T cells. We did this phase 2 trial to investigate the activity of pidilizumab, a humanised anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, with rituximab in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma. METHODS: We did this open-label, non-randomised trial at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Adult (>/=18 years) patients with rituximab-sensitive follicular lymphoma relapsing after one to four previous therapies were eligible. Pidilizumab was administered at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for four infusions, plus eight optional infusions every 4 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. Starting 17 days after the first infusion of pidilizumab, rituximab was given at 375 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (complete response plus partial response according to Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00904722. FINDINGS: We enrolled 32 patients between Jan 13, 2010, and Jan 20, 2012. Median follow-up was 15.4 months (IQR 10.1-21.0). The combination of pidilizumab and rituximab was well tolerated, with no autoimmune or treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4. The most common adverse events of grade 1 were anaemia (14 patients) and fatigue (13 patients), and the most common adverse event of grade 2 was respiratory infection (five patients). Of the 29 patients evaluable for activity, 19 (66%) achieved an objective response: complete responses were noted in 15 (52%) patients and partial responses in four (14%).

We aimed to assess safety and activity of ibrutinib, an orally administered covalent inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), in treatment-naive patients aged 65 years and older with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS: In our open-label phase 1b/2 trial, we enrolled previously untreated patients at clinical sites in the USA. Eligible patients were aged at least 65 years, and had symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma requiring therapy. Patients received 28 day cycles of once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg or ibrutinib 840 mg. The 840 mg dose was discontinued after enrolment had begun because comparable activity of the doses has been shown. The primary endpoint was the safety of the dose-fixed regimen in terms of frequency and severity of adverse events for all patients who received treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01105247. FINDINGS: Between May 20, 2010, and Dec 18, 2012, we enrolled 29 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and two patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma. Median age was 71 years (range 65-84), and 23 (74%) patients were at least 70 years old. Toxicity was mainly of mild-to-moderate severity (grade 1-2). 21 (68%) patients had diarrhoea (grade 1 in 14 [45%] patients, grade 2 in three [10%] patients, and grade 3 in four [13%] patients). 15 (48%) patients developed nausea (grade 1 in 12 [39%] patients and grade 2 in three [10%] patients). Ten (32%) patients developed fatigue (grade 1 in five [16%] patients, grade 2 in four [13%] patients, and grade 3 in one [3%] patient). Three (10%) patients developed grade 3 infections, although no grade 4 or 5 infections occurred. One patient developed grade 3 neutropenia, and one developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia. After a median follow-up of 22.1 months (IQR 18.4-23.2), 22 (71%) of 31 patients achieved an objective response (95% CI 52.0-85.8); four patients (13%) had a complete response, one patient (3%) had a nodular partial response, and 17 (55%) patients had a partial response. INTERPRETATION: The safety and activity of ibrutinib in elderly, previously untreated patients with symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, or small lymphocytic lymphoma is encouraging, and merits further investigation in phase 3 trials.

However, some patients present with AP features at the time of diagnosis. There is limited information on the outcome of these patients who received TKIs as initial therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 51 consecutive patients with CML who presented with features of AP at the time of diagnosis, including blasts >/= 15% (n = 6), basophils >/= 20% (n = 22), platelets < 100 x 10(9)/L (n = 3), cytogenetic clonal evolution (n = 17), or more than 1 feature (n = 3). Patients received initial therapy with imatinib (n = 30), dasatinib (n = 5), or nilotinib (n = 16). RESULTS: The rate of complete cytogenetic response for patients treated with imatinib was 80%, and with dasatinib or nilotinib was 90%. Major molecular response (MMR) (Breakpoint Cluster Region (BCR)-Abelson (ABL)/ABL </= 0.1%, International Scale [IS]) was achieved in 69% of patients including complete molecular response (BCR-ABL/ABL </= 0.0032% IS) in 49%. MMR rates for patients treated with imatinib were 63%, and with 2GTKIs, 76%. Overall survival at 36 months was 87% with imatinib and 95% with 2GTKIs.

Leukemia and lymphoma arise from similar cell lines and can have overlapping imaging features; however, the clinical presentation, imaging strategies, and treatment protocols can vary substantially based on the specific subtype. Although imaging does not play a central role in staging or monitoring disease in childhood leukemia, findings on imaging may be the first indication of the diagnosis. Advanced imaging, especially positron emission tomography/computed tomography, has moved to the forefront of staging and treatment response evaluation in Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Imaging also plays a key role in evaluating the myriad of treatment complications that are commonly seen with chemotherapy and associated neutropenia. Future efforts will be largely focused on decreasing radiation exposure to these children, utilizing reduced or radiation-free modalities, such as positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance and diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background suppression, as well as refining surveillance imaging strategies. The purpose of this article is to briefly review the classification of pediatric leukemia and lymphoma, illustrate common imaging findings at presentation throughout the body, describe staging and therapeutic response evaluation, and show a spectrum of commonly encountered complications of treatment.","['Averill, Lauren W', 'Acikgoz, Gunsel', 'Miller, Robin E', 'Kandula, Vinay V R', 'Epelman, Monica']","['Averill LW', 'Acikgoz G', 'Miller RE', 'Kandula VV', 'Epelman M']","['Medical Imaging, Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE.

Here, we show that surface functionalization of polystyrene nanoparticles with amino groups (PS-NH2), but not with carboxyl groups (PS-COOH), induces G2 cell-cycle arrest and inhibition of proliferation in three leukemia cell lines. Besides, PS-NH2 inhibit angiogenesis and proliferation of leukemia cells xenografted onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane. At the molecular level, PS-NH2 inhibit, whereas PS-COOH activate mTOR signaling in leukemia cells. Consistently, PS-NH2 block activation of the mTOR downstream targets, Akt and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1, and induce overexpression of the cell-cycle regulator p21(Cip1/Waf1) and degradation of cyclin B1. After addition, both types of particles rapidly induce autophagy in leukemia cells. Yet, only in PS-NH2-treated cells, acidic vesicular organelles show elevated pH and impaired processing of procathepsin B. Moreover, solely in PS-NH2-treated cells, autophagy is followed by permeabilization of acidic vesicular organelles and induction of apoptosis. By contrast, primary macrophages, which do not exhibit activated mTOR signaling, proved relatively resistant to PS-NH2-induced toxicity. These data indicate that functionalized nanoparticles can be used to control activation of mTOR signaling pathways, and to influence proliferation and viability of malignant cells.","['Loos, Cornelia', 'Syrovets, Tatiana', 'Musyanovych, Anna', 'Mailander, Volker', 'Landfester, Katharina', 'Simmet, Thomas']","['Loos C', 'Syrovets T', 'Musyanovych A', 'Mailander V', 'Landfester K', 'Simmet T']","['Institute of Pharmacology of Natural Products & Clinical Pharmacology, Ulm University, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology of Natural Products & Clinical Pharmacology, Ulm University, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Pneumology, University Medical Center Mainz, Langenbeckstr. 1, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology of Natural Products & Clinical Pharmacology, Ulm University, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.

METHODS: The anti-proliferation effect of resveratrol-induced, apoptosis and autophagy on T-ALL cells were detected by using MTT test, immunofluorescence, electronic microscope, and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blotting was performed for detecting changes of apoptosis-associated proteins, cell cycle regulatory proteins and state of activation of Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, 4E-BP1, and p38-MAPK. RESULTS: Resveratrol inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis and autophagy in T-ALL cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. It also induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via up regulating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27 and down regulating cyclin A and cyclin D1. Western blotting revealed that resveratrol significantly decreased the expression of antiapoptotic proteins (Mcl-1 and Bcl-2) and increased the expression of proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bim, and Bad), and induced cleaved-caspase-3 in a time-dependent manner. Significant increase in ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin 1 was also detected. Furthermore, resveratrol induced significant dephosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1, but enhanced specific phosphorylation of p38-MAPK which could be blocked by SB203580. When autophagy was suppressed by 3-MA, apoptosis in T-ALL cells induced by resveratrol was enhanced. CONCLUSION: Our findings have suggested that resveratrol induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in T-ALL cells through inhibiting Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 and activating p38-MAPK signaling pathways. Autophagy might play a role as a self-defense mechanism in T-ALL cells treated by resveratrol. Therefore, the reasonable inhibition of autophagy in T-ALL cells may serve as a promising strategy for resveratrol induced apoptosis and can be used as adjuvant chemotherapy for T-ALL.","['Ge, Jiao', 'Liu, Yan', 'Li, Qiang', 'Guo, Xia', 'Gu, Ling', 'Ma, Zhi Gui', 'Zhu, Yi Ping']","['Ge J', 'Liu Y', 'Li Q', 'Guo X', 'Gu L', 'Ma ZG', 'Zhu YP']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Biomed Environ Sci,Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,8909524,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/03/14 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3967/bes2013.019 [doi]', 'S0895-3988(13)60130-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomed Environ Sci. 2013 Nov;26(11):902-11. doi: 10.3967/bes2013.019.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt/mTOR', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Resveratrol', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'p38-MAPK']",,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.', 'Published by China CDC.

The median time to development of t-MDS/AML is 3-5 years, with the risk decreasing markedly after the first decade. t-MDS/AML is the major cause of non-relapse mortality after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for HL or NHL. The magnitude of risk of t-MDS/AML is higher, and the latency is shorter after HCT, compared to conventional therapy. Two types of t-MDS/AML are recognized depending on the causative therapeutic exposure: an alkylating agent/radiation-related type and a topoisomerase II inhibitor-related type. Inter-individual variability in the risk for development of t-MDS/AML suggests a role for genetic variation in susceptibility to genotoxic exposures. Treatment of t-MDS/AML with conventional therapy is associated with a uniformly poor prognosis, with a median survival of 6 months. Because of the poor response to conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic HCT is recommended. Current research is focused on developing risk prediction and risk reduction strategies.","['Bhatia, Smita']",['Bhatia S'],"['Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.

Whether an oncogenic protein, beta-catenin, is positively involved in LPS-induced cytotoxicity in a mouse leukemic monocyte cell line, RAW 264.7, was examined. TWS119, a GSK-3beta inhibitor, increased LPS-induced beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and augmented LPS-induced cytotoxicity. Cardamonin, a beta-catenin inhibitor, inhibited LPS-induced beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and reduced LPS-induced cytotoxicity. To confirm that beta-catenin is involved in LPS-induced cytotoxicity, silencing of beta-catenin expression by siRNA was carried out. The results were that knockdown of beta-catenin reduced LPS-induced cytotoxicity. Interestingly, Cardamonin treatment or beta-catenin silencing reduced LPS-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses such as PERK and e1F-2alpha phosphorylation and CHOP expression. Moreover, TWS119 increased LPS-induced ER stress responses. On the basis of these results, the oncogenic protein beta-catenin is considered to be positively involved in LPS-induced cytotoxicity, possibly by downregulating ER stress responses.","['Koide, Naoki', 'Naiki, Yoshikazu', 'Odkhuu, Erdenezaya', 'Tsolmongyn, Bilegtsaikhan', 'Komatsu, Takayuki', 'Ito, Kiyoaki', 'Yoshida, Tomoaki', 'Yokochi, Takashi']","['Koide N', 'Naiki Y', 'Odkhuu E', 'Tsolmongyn B', 'Komatsu T', 'Ito K', 'Yoshida T', 'Yokochi T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TWS 119)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'H8KP1OJ8JX (cardamonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects/physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Leukemia', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'beta Catenin/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/07/23 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504013X13793555706803 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2013;21(1):59-65. doi: 10.3727/096504013X13793555706803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we stably expressed Bmi-1 in a human gastric epithelial immortalized cell line, GES-1.

CONCLUSIONS: The chromosome material lost in MDS/AML/MPN is highly variable with no identifiable common deleted regions, whereas in SDS the loss is more uniform: in 3/6 patients it was almost identical, and the breakpoints that we defined are probably common to most patients from the literature. In some SDS patients less material may be lost, due to different distal breakpoints, but the proximal breakpoint is in the same region, always leading to the loss of the EIF6 gene, an event which was related to a lower risk of MDS/AML in comparison with other patients.","['Valli, Roberto', 'Pressato, Barbara', 'Marletta, Cristina', 'Mare, Lydia', 'Montalbano, Giuseppe', 'Curto, Francesco Lo', 'Pasquali, Francesco', 'Maserati, Emanuela']","['Valli R', 'Pressato B', 'Marletta C', 'Mare L', 'Montalbano G', 'Curto FL', 'Pasquali F', 'Maserati E']","[""Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, Universita dell'Insubria, Via J, H, Dunant, 5, I 21100 Varese, Italy. emanuela.maserati@uninsubria.it.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131212,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC3914702,2013/12/18 06:00,2013/12/18 06:01,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-6-56 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-6-56 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2013 Dec 12;6(1):56. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-6-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: It seems that in developing countries, using prophylactic ciprofloxacin has no significant effect on the incidence of neutropenic fever and the outcome of the AML patients.","['Ghadiany, Mojtaba', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Rezvani, Hamid', 'Mohammad Alizadeh, Afshin', 'Zamani, Nasim', 'Mehdizadeh, Mahshid', 'Foratyazdi, Mohammad']","['Ghadiany M', 'Rahimi H', 'Rezvani H', 'Mohammad Alizadeh A', 'Zamani N', 'Mehdizadeh M', 'Foratyazdi M']","['Department of Oncology, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology, Hamedan University of Medical Sciences, Hamedan, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Toxicology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology, Yazd University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131017,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,['5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ajco.12133 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2016 Mar;12(1):e11-5. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12133.

The present study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activities of the organic extracts from twenty six Saudi Arabian medicinal plants. The study was also extended to the investigation of the effects of the extracts from the four best plants, Ononis serrata (SY160), Haplophyllum tuberculatum (SY177), Pulicaria crispa (SY179), and Achillea beiberstenii (SY-200) on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, caspases activities and mitochondrial function in leukemia CCRF-CEM cell line. METHODS: A resazurin assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the extracts on a panel of human cancer cell lines whilst the microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the samples against twelve bacterial strains belonging to four species, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The best activity on leukemia cell lines were recorded with SY177 (IC50 of 9.94 mug/mL) and SY179 (IC50 of 1.81 mug/mL) against CCRF-CEM as well as Ach-b (IC50 of 9.30 mug/mL) and SY160 (IC50 of 5.06 mug/mL) against HL60 cells. The extracts from SY177 and SY179 were also toxic against the seven solid cancer cell lines studied with the highest IC50 values of 31.64 mug/mL (SY177 against Hep-G2 cells). SY177 and Ach-b induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 and S phases whilst SY160 and SY179 induced arrest in G0/G1 phase. All the four plant extracts induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells with the alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In the antibacterial assays, only Ach-b displayed moderate antibacterial activities against E. coli and E. aerogenes ATCC strains (MIC of 256 mug/mL), AG100A(TeT) and K. pneumoniae ATCC strains (MIC of 128 mug/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Finally, the results of the present investigation provided supportive data for the possible use of some Saudi Arabian plants investigated herein, and mostly Haplophyllum tuberculatum, Pulicaria crispa, Ononis serrata and Achillea beiberstenii in the control of cancer diseases.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Wiench, Benjamin', 'Alsaid, Mansour S', 'Alyahya, Muhammad A', 'Fankam, Aime G', 'Shahat, Abdelaaty A', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Wiench B', 'Alsaid MS', 'Alyahya MA', 'Fankam AG', 'Shahat AA', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany. ashahat@ksu.edu.sa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131212,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Pseudomonas/drug effects']",PMC4029389,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/05/14 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-13-354 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-13-354 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2013 Dec 12;13:354. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-13-354.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We explored association of 34,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related primarily to pharmacogenomics and immune function to risk of infections among 69 ALL patients on induction therapy. RESULTS: Forty-eight (70%) patients experienced infectious events including 23 with positive blood cultures. Infectious events and positive blood cultures were associated significantly with 24 and 21 SNPs, respectively (P < 0.01). Classification and regression tree analysis demonstrated rs11033797 (OR51F1), rs2835265 (CBR1), rs28627172 (POLDIP3) and rs1129844 (CCL11) to be predictive of outcome. Among 61 patients for whom read-outs were available for all four SNPs, 40 of 41 patients with the worst SNP profile experienced at least one infectious event compared with five of the remaining 20 patients (Hazard ratio 9.0, 95% CI 3.4-23.5, which was unchanged after adjustments for neutrophil counts). Pathway analysis identified variations in 'G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) downstream signalling', 'Bile acid and bile salt metabolism' and 'Class I MHC-mediated antigen processing and presentation' to be highly predictive of infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that host genomic profiling may predict the risk of infections during induction therapy.

Expression of LMO2 has been demonstrated in germinal centre B cells, various B cell lymphomas and T lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukaemia (T-ALL), but has not been studied extensively in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: We studied LMO2 expression by immunohistochemistry in biopsies from a cohort of AML patients (n = 196) and correlated it with established prognostic factors such as age, bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic findings. RESULTS: Forty per cent (79 of 196) of the samples from AML patients showed moderate/strong expression of LMO2 protein. LMO2 expression showed a significant positive correlation with normal cytogenetics (65% versus 24%, P < 0.0001) and a moderately negative correlation with complex karyotype [rs (98) = -0.218, P < 0.002]. AML associated with core binding factor [(t(8;21)/inv(16)/t(16;16)] had low LMO2 expression compared to diploid karyotype (29% versus 65%; P = 0.013). Expression of LMO2 protein exhibited an insignificant association with age (P = 0.197). Lower expression of LMO2 protein was noted in AML associated with myelodysplasia-related changes, compared to AML subtypes based on FAB classification (M0-M7) (21% versus 44%, P = 0.0187). CONCLUSIONS: LMO2 is expressed in a subset of AML patients and is associated with normal karyotype, which is different from T-ALL, where specific translocation (11p13) mediates protein expression.","['Patel, Jay L', 'Pournazari, Payam', 'Haggstrom, Sarah-Joy', 'Kosari, Farid', 'Shabani-Rad, Meer-Taher', 'Natkunam, Yasodha', 'Mansoor, Adnan']","['Patel JL', 'Pournazari P', 'Haggstrom SJ', 'Kosari F', 'Shabani-Rad MT', 'Natkunam Y', 'Mansoor A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131106,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Germinal Center/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Karyotyping', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/22 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/his.12242 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2014 Jan;64(2):226-33. doi: 10.1111/his.12242.

To evaluate a state of maternal blood screening for mother-to-child infections in Japan, we for the first time conducted a nationwide survey on obstetric facilities where regular maternity checkups were carried out. A questionnaire assessment involved an annual number of deliveries, scale of facilities and a state of maternal blood screening for eight pathogens. A high rate (73.7%) of reply to the questionnaire was achieved from 1990 facilities, covering 75.1% of annual number of delivery in 2011. The performance rates of blood screening were more than 99% for rubella virus, Treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus, while the rate was found to be only 4.5% for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and 48.5% for Toxoplasma gondii with large differences in regions. Most of the facilities performed blood tests for rubella virus, Treponema pallidum, HIV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus once in early pregnancy, while approximately 28% of the facilities performed blood tests for HTLV-1 once during the 2nd or 3rd trimester. Most of the facilities used HA tests for Toxoplasma gondii, whereas there was a wide variation in antibody measurement methods for CMV. Generally, the obstetric facilities in Japan have performed maternal blood screening properly according to the current recommendations. The results of this survey involve important information and are helpful for clinical practitioners.","['Yamada, Hideto', 'Tairaku, Shinya', 'Morioka, Ichiro', 'Ebina, Yasuhiko', 'Sonoyama, Ayako', 'Tanimura, Kenji', 'Deguchi, Masashi', 'Nagamata, Satoshi']","['Yamada H', 'Tairaku S', 'Morioka I', 'Ebina Y', 'Sonoyama A', 'Tanimura K', 'Deguchi M', 'Nagamata S']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Congenit Anom (Kyoto),Congenital anomalies,9306292,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*blood/microbiology/virology', 'Japan', '*Mass Screening', '*Mother-Child Relations', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*blood/microbiology/virology']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cga.12044 [doi]'],ppublish,Congenit Anom (Kyoto). 2014 May;54(2):100-3. doi: 10.1111/cga.12044.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Toxoplasma gondii', 'Treponema pallidum', 'cytomegalovirus', 'parvovirus B19', 'rubella virus']",,,,['(c) 2013 Japanese Teratology Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

To understand immature T-ALL of which ETP-ALL is part, we used these antigens to subcategorize non-ETP T-ALL for examining expression of myeloid/stem cell antigens (M/S) and clinical features. Using CD5 (+/-) to start categorization, we studied 69 routinely immunophenotyped patients with T-ALL. CD5(-) was a homogenous (CD8,CD1a)(-) M/S(+) ETP-ALL group (n = 9). CD5(+) cases were (CD8,CD1a)(-) pre-T-ALL (n = 22) or (CD8,CD1a)(+) (n = 38) thymic/cortical T-ALL; M/S(+) 20/22 (90.91%) in former and 22/38 (57.89%) in latter (P = 0.007). ETP- and pre-T-ALL together (CD1a(-) ,CD5(-/+) immature T-ALL group) were nearly always M/S(+) (29/31; 93.55%). In multivariate analysis, only ETP-ALL predicted poor overall survival (P = 0.02). We conclude (i) CD5 negativity in T-ALL almost always means ETP-ALL. CD1a and CD8 negativity, as much as CD5, marks immaturity in T-ALL, and the CD5(+/-) /CD1a(-) /CD8(-) immature T-ALL group needs further study to understand the biology of the T-ALL-myeloid interface. (ii) ETP-ALL patients may be pre-T-ALL if CD2(+) ; CD2(+) , conversely, CD5(-) /CD1a(-) /CD8(-) pre-T ALL patients are ETP-ALL. (iii) Immunophenotypic workup of T-ALL must not omit CD1a, CD5, CD8 and CD2, and positivity of antigens should preferably be defined as recommended for ETP-ALL, so that this entity can be better evaluated in future studies of immature T-ALL, a group to which ETP-ALL belongs.

Surprisingly, we recently confirmed NES as a tumour-specific marker for mature CD138(+) 38(+) plasma cells (PC) in multiple myeloma (MM). The present study analysed NES expression throughout the spectrum of MM developmental stages, starting with individuals with no haematological malignancy, through monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM to plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) and MM cell lines. NES was analysed in bone marrow PC of 163 MM, four PCL and nine MGUS patients, 10 individuals with no haematological malignancy and 6 myeloma cell lines (OPM-2, RPMI-8226, MOLP-8, U-266, EJM, NCI-H929) by flow cytometry and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction or immunochemistry. We observed a tendency of increased NES expression in parallel with disease progression. NES was evaluated as a reliable marker for accurate discrimination between MM patients and the control group. High NES levels were strongly associated with the presence of 1q21 gain. For the first time, NES was demonstrated to predict worse response to conventional therapy/novel agents.

HSCs engraft for long-term blood cell production and could provide a continuous source of targeted anti-cancer effector cells to sustain remissions. T cells produced de novo from HSCs may continuously replenish anti-tumor T cells that have become anergic or exhausted from ex vivo expansion or exposure to the intratumoral microenvironment. In addition, transgenic T cells produced in vivo undergo allelic exclusion, preventing co-expression of an endogenous TCR that could mis-pair with the introduced TCR chains and blunt activity or even cause off-target reactivity. CAR-engineered HSCs may produce myeloid and natural killer cells in addition to T cells expressing the CAR, providing broader anti-tumor activity that arises quickly after transplant and does not solely require de novo thymopoiesis. Use of TCR- or CAR-engineered HSCs would likely require cytoreductive conditioning to achieve long-term engraftment, and this approach may be used in clinical settings where autologous HSC transplant is being performed to add a graft-versus-tumor effect.

On the back of this, other emerging immune-based therapies are providing great promise. T-cell therapy is one such area where recent trials using T cells genetically modified to express an antibody-based chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeted against the CD19 antigen have demonstrated impressive responses when adoptively transferred to patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The general concept of the CAR T cell was devised some 20 years ago. In this relatively short period of time, the technology to redirect T-cell function has moved at pace facilitating clinical translation; however, many questions remain with respect to developing the approach to improve CAR T-cell therapeutic activity and also to broaden the range of tumors that can be effectively targeted by this approach. This review highlights some of the underlying principles and compromises of CAR T-cell technology using the CD19-targeted CAR as a paradigm and discusses some of the issues that relate to targeting solid tumors with CAR T cells.","['Cheadle, Eleanor J', 'Gornall, Hannah', 'Baldan, Vania', 'Hanson, Vivien', 'Hawkins, Robert E', 'Gilham, David E']","['Cheadle EJ', 'Gornall H', 'Baldan V', 'Hanson V', 'Hawkins RE', 'Gilham DE']","['Clinical and Experimental Immunotherapy Group, Department of Medical Oncology, Institute of Cancer Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Healthcare Science Centre, Manchester, UK; Targeted Therapy Group, Institute of Cancer Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Healthcare Science Centre, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/01 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12126 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2014 Jan;257(1):91-106. doi: 10.1111/imr.12126.,,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'gene transfer', 'lymphoma']",,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Infusions of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells targeting viral antigens derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induce sustained complete tumor remissions in patients with highly immunogenic tumors such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, although resistance occurred when the infused T-cell population had restricted antigen specificity. T cells specific for EBV antigens have also produced complete remissions of EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas and lymphomas developing in immunocompetent individuals, even though in these patients tumor survival is dependent on their ability to evade T-cell immunity. Adapting this strategy to non-viral tumors is more challenging, as the target antigens expressed are less immunogenic and the tumors lack the potent danger signals that are characteristic of viruses. The goals of current studies are to define conditions that promote expansion of antigen-specific T cells ex vivo and to ensure their in vivo persistence and survival by combining with maneuvers such as lymphodepletion, checkpoint inhibition, cytokine infusions, or genetic manipulations. More pragmatic goals are to streamline manufacturing to facilitate the transition of these therapies to late phase trials and to evaluate closely histocompatibility antigen (HLA)-matched banked antigen-specific T cells so that T-cell therapies can be made more broadly available.","['Rooney, Cliona M', 'Leen, Ann M', 'Vera, Juan F', 'Heslop, Helen E']","['Rooney CM', 'Leen AM', 'Vera JF', 'Heslop HE']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/etiology/therapy/virology', 'Melanoma/immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism']",PMC3869095,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/08/01 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12133 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2014 Jan;257(1):39-55. doi: 10.1111/imr.12133.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein Barr virus', 'tumor antigen', 'virus-specific T cells']",,"['HHSN268201000007C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA094237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS536664'],['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Several protocols recommend that the two perceived high-risk adjuvanted vaccines should be administered into distinct anatomical sites (""left hind leg leukaemia, right hind leg rabies""), which should aid surgical resection. This has resulted in a change in tumour distribution with an increased proportion situated caudal to the diaphragm when such a policy is adopted. The aim of this study was to determine UK cat owners' attitudes towards surgical treatments of different anatomical regions. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of an anonymous convenience sample of UK cat owners was conducted from September to December, 2012 using an internet-based survey. RESULTS: There were a total of 208 respondents: 39% would pursue surgery regardless of tumour site. One percent would not pursue surgery. Of the remainder, respondents would not allow amputation of the forelimb (20%), hindlimb (15%) or tail (15%). Twenty-six, 32 and 27% would not have surgical treatment of the inter-scapular region, chest or abdomen, respectively. The majority of respondents were willing to travel up to 100 miles for radiotherapy or chemotherapy (66 and 69%, respectively).

In previous studies, we found a T-ALL case with two malignant T-cell clones with Vdelta1Ddelta2Ddelta3Jdelta1 and Vdelta2Ddelta3Jdelta2 rearrangements. In this study, we further characterized T-ALL cases with two malignant clones containing Vdelta1Ddelta3Jdelta1 and Vdelta2Ddelta1Jdelta1 rearrangements using fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR), sequencing, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. We further analyzed the distribution and clonality of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vgamma and Vdelta subfamily T cells in the two T-ALL cases by RT-PCR and GeneScan. Monoclonal Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 subfamilies were confirmed in both samples, the Vdelta3 through Vdelta7 subfamilies could not be detected in the T-ALL samples, whereas the oligoclonal Vdelta8 subfamily could be identified. Based on the clinical finding that both of the T-ALL cases with two malignant T-cell clones had a poor outcome, we attempted to compare the expression pattern of genes related to T-cell activation and proliferation between cases with the malignant Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 T-cell clones and T-ALL cases with a mono-malignant Valpha T-cell clone. We selected two T-ALL cases with ValphaJalpha rearrangements and analyzed the expression level of Notch1, TAL1, and the CARMA-BCL10-MALT-A20-NF-kappaB pathway genes by real-time PCR. A20 had significantly higher expression in the biclonal compared with the monoclonal T-ALL group (p=0.0354), and there was a trend toward higher expression for the other genes in the biclonal group with the exception of TAL1, although the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we identified two T-ALL cases with biclonal malignant T-cell clones and described the characteristics of the biclonal T-ALL subtype and its gene expression pattern.

BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines represent the highest risk for development of cardiotoxicity. GPBB belongs to proposed biomarkers of cardiac injury with a very limited experience in this context. METHODS: Totally, 24 adult patients with acute leukemia were enrolled. Plasma GPBB concentrations were measured by ELISA at diagnosis (before chemotherapy), after first chemotherapy with anthracyclines and 6 months after the completion of treatment. The cut-off value for GPBB positivity was 10.00 microg/L as recommended by the manufacturer. RESULTS: Before chemotherapy, the mean plasma GPBB concentration was 5.25+/-3.81 microg/L, increased above the cut-off in 1 patient (4.2 %). After the first chemotherapy, the mean GPBB was 6.61+/-5.54 microg/L, positive in 7 (29.2 %) patients. Six months after treatment, the mean GPBB was 10.06+/-11.41 microg/L, positive in 8 (33.3 %) patients. Six months after treatment, we found a significant correlation between elevation in GPBB and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography (r=0.621; p<0.0001). The differences in plasma GPBB between healthy blood donors and patients treated for acute leukemia were statistically significant (p<0.01 in all cases). CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that GPBB could become a potential biomarker for detection of acute and chronic cardiotoxicity associated with anthracycline containing chemotherapy. The predictive value for development of treatment-related cardiomyopathy in future is not clear and will be evaluated during the follow-up. Further studies are needed to define the potential role of GPBB and other biomarkers in the assessment of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (Ref. 21).

The subcellular localization of PpIX and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation were determined by confocal microscope. The cell viability was examined by MTT assay. Annexin V-PE/7-AAD and DAPI staining were used to detect apoptotic cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) changes were tested by rhodamine123 staining. DNA damage was measured by comet assay. RESULTS: PpIX preferentially accumulated in L1210 cells compared to PBMCs and PpIX mainly located in the mitochondria of L1210 cells. PpIX at a concentration of 1 microg/ml or above exerted significant anti-tumor effect and the cell viability loss presented PpIX dose-dependent manner. Typical apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation were observed by DAPI staining. Annexin V-PE/7-AAD analysis showed 5 microg/ml PpIX could induce about 24% cell apoptosis, which was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. In addition, the PpIX caused MMP loss, AIF translocation to nucleus and serious DNA damage were also suppressed by CsA. CONCLUSION: The results indicate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis were involved in PpIX caused cell damage on L1210 cells.","['Su, Xiaomin', 'Chen, Yan', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Wang, Pan', 'Li, Long', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Su X', 'Chen Y', 'Wang X', 'Wang Y', 'Wang P', 'Li L', 'Liu Q']","[""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131216,United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Photosensitizing Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01480545.2013.866135 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2014 Jul;37(3):348-56. doi: 10.3109/01480545.2013.866135.

Self-assembly of DNA molecules via sticky ends is currently used to grow DNA structures with desired architectures. The sticky end links are the weakest parts of such structures. In this work, the strength of sticky end links is studied by computational means. The number of basepairs in the sticky end and the sequence are varied, and the response to tension along the axis of the molecule is evaluated using a full atomistic model. It is observed that, generally, increasing the number of basepairs in the sticky end increases the strength, but the central factor controlling this parameter is the basepair sequence. The sticky ends are divided into two classes of low and high strength. The second class has strength comparable with that of a double stranded molecule with one nick in one of the strands. The strength of the first class is roughly half that of the strong sticky ends. For all strong sticky ends tested, the enhanced stability is associated with the formation of an unusually stable complex composed from two basepairs and two flanking bases of certain sequence. This complex rotates and aligns with the direction of the force allowing significant deformation and providing enhanced strength. This is similar to a mechanism recently suggested to enhance the mechanical stability of an RNA kissing loop from the Moloney murine leukemia virus. The model is tested against experimental structural data for sticky ends and against published simulation results for the stretch of double stranded DNA. The results provide guidance for the design of DNA self-assembled structures and indicate the types of sticky ends desirable if maximizing the strength and stability of these structures is targeted.","['Ban, Ehsan', 'Picu, Catalin R']","['Ban E', 'Picu CR']","['Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Troy, New York, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131212,United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary/genetics', 'Tensile Strength/*physiology']",,2013/12/18 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/12/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bm401425k [doi]'],ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2014 Jan 13;15(1):143-9. doi: 10.1021/bm401425k.

Currently, Stevia extracts are largely used as a noncaloric high-potency biosweetener alternative to sugar, due to the growing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic disorders worldwide. Despite the large number of studies on Stevia and steviol glycosides in vivo, little is reported concerning the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects on human health. The effect of four commercial Stevia extracts on glucose transport activity was evaluated in HL-60 human leukaemia and in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The extracts were able to enhance glucose uptake in both cellular lines, as efficiently as insulin. Our data suggest that steviol glycosides could act by modulating GLUT translocation through the PI3K/Akt pathway since treatments with both insulin and Stevia extracts increased the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt. Furthermore, Stevia extracts were able to revert the effect of the reduction of glucose uptake caused by methylglyoxal, an inhibitor of the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway. These results corroborate the hypothesis that Stevia extracts could mimic insulin effects modulating PI3K/Akt pathway.","['Rizzo, Benedetta', 'Zambonin, Laura', 'Angeloni, Cristina', 'Leoncini, Emanuela', 'Dalla Sega, Francesco Vieceli', 'Prata, Cecilia', 'Fiorentini, Diana', 'Hrelia, Silvana']","['Rizzo B', 'Zambonin L', 'Angeloni C', 'Leoncini E', 'Dalla Sega FV', 'Prata C', 'Fiorentini D', 'Hrelia S']","['Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Corso Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131112,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4741LYX6RT (steviol)', '722KLD7415 (Pyruvaldehyde)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative/metabolism', 'Glycosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyruvaldehyde/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC3845854,2013/12/12 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/348169 [doi]'],ppublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2013;2013:348169. doi: 10.1155/2013/348169.

Unfortunately, limiting the application of this effective agent to APL patients is severe cardiotoxicity. Resveratrol, the natural food-derived polyphenolic compound, is well known for its antioxidant properties and protects the cardiovascular system. But the potential role of resveratrol against As2O3 in heart via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of pretreatment with resveratrol and As2O3 on oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction in rat. In the present study, resveratrol decreased As2O3-induced reactive oxygen species generation, oxidative DNA damage, and pathological alterations. In addition, cardiac dysfunction parameters, intracellular calcium and arsenic accumulation, glutathione redox ratio, and cAMP deficiency levels were observed in As2O3-treated rats; these changes were attenuated by resveratrol. Furthermore, resveratrol significantly prohibited the downregulation of both Nrf2 and HO-1 gene expressions that were downregulated by As2O3, whereas resveratrol did not alter As2O3-induced nitric oxide formation. Thus, the protective role of resveratrol against As2O3-induced cardiotoxicity is implemented by the maintenance of redox homeostasis (Nrf2-HO-1 pathway) and facilitating arsenic efflux. Our findings suggest coadministration with resveratrol, and As2O3 might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for APL.","['Zhang, Weiqian', 'Guo, Changming', 'Gao, Ruifeng', 'Ge, Ming', 'Zhu, Yanzhu', 'Zhang, Zhigang']","['Zhang W', 'Guo C', 'Gao R', 'Ge M', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhang Z']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131114,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC3847954,2013/12/12 06:00,2013/12/12 06:01,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/407839 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013;2013:407839. doi: 10.1155/2013/407839.

However, the identification involving chemoresistant features for cell surface proteins is a challenge. To identify potential cell membrane markers in hematologic cancer MDR, we used a cell- and antibody-based strategy of subtractive immunization coupled with cell surface comparative screening of leukemia cell lines from sensitive HL60 and resistant HL60/DOX cells. Fifty one antibodies that recognized the cell surface proteins expressed differently between the two cell lines were generated. One of them, the McAb-5D12 not only recognizes its antigen but also block its function. Comparative analysis of immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and mass spectrum analysis validated that the membrane antigen of McAb-5D12 is a nucleoprotein-polypyrimidine tract binding protein associated splicing factor, PSF. Our results identified that PSF overexpressed on the membrane of sensitive cells compared with resistant cells and its relocation from the nuclear to the cell surface was common in hematological malignancy cell lines and marrow of leukemia patients.

We investigated the effect of FGFR inhibition in pancreatic cancer in complementary cancer models derived from cell lines and patient-derived primary tumour explants. METHODS: The effects of FGFR signalling inhibition in pancreatic cancer were evaluated using anti-FRS2 shRNA and dovitinib. Pancreatic cancers with varying sensitivity to dovitinib were evaluated to determine potential predictive biomarkers of efficacy. Primary pancreatic explants with opposite extreme of biomarker expression were selected from 13 tumours for in vivo dovitinib treatment. RESULTS: Treatment with anti-FRS2 shRNA induced significant in vitro cell kill in pancreatic cancer cells. Dovitinib treatment achieved similar effects and was mediated by Akt/Mcl-1 signalling in sensitive cells. Dovitinib efficacy correlated with FRS2 phosphorylation status, FGFR2 mRNA level and FGFR2 IIIb expression but not phosphorylation status of VEGFR2 and PDGFRbeta. Using FGFR2 mRNA level, a proof-of-concept study using primary pancreatic cancer explants correctly identified the tumours' sensitivity to dovitinib. CONCLUSION: Inhibiting FGFR signalling using shRNA and dovitinib achieved significant anti-cancer cancer effects in pancreatic cancer. The effect was more pronounced in FGFR2 IIIb overexpressing pancreatic cancer that may be dependent on aberrant stimulation by stromal-derived FGF ligands.","['Zhang, H', 'Hylander, B L', 'LeVea, C', 'Repasky, E A', 'Straubinger, R M', 'Adjei, A A', 'Ma, W W']","['Zhang H', 'Hylander BL', 'LeVea C', 'Repasky EA', 'Straubinger RM', 'Adjei AA', 'Ma WW']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Department of Immunity, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Department of Immunity, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131210,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0', '(4-amino-5-fluoro-3-(5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinolin-2(1', 'H)-one)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FRS2 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinolones/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC3899776,2013/12/12 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013754 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.754 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2014 Jan 21;110(2):320-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.754.

METHODS: Parents (n=231) of children with leukemia (study group) and parents (n=261) of children with acute respiratory/digestive infections (control group) were recruited from five hospitals in southern China. Children's clinical characteristics and parents' demographic characteristics, depression, type D personality, coping styles, and social support were collected with self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Parents of children with leukemia, especially mothers, reported higher levels of depression accompanied by a higher prevalence of type D personality, more negative coping styles, and less subjective social support, but received more objective social support than controls (P<0.05). The depression in parents in the study group was positively correlated with type D personality and negative coping style, but negatively correlated with social support and positive coping styles (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that type D personality (OR=5.64, P<0.001), lower social support (OR=2.38, P=0.020), and less positive coping (OR=3.32, P=0.003) were independently associated with depression in parents of children with leukemia. As for demographic characteristics, female, lower education level, unemployed, and paying medical expenses at one's own expenses were independent predictors of depression in parents of children with leukemia. CONCLUSION: Depression and type D personality were remarkably prevalent in parents of children with leukemia in southern China. Type D personality and multiple social factors were associated with depression in parents of children with leukemia.","['Chen, Jie', 'Liu, Yang', 'Cai, Qingqing', 'Liu, Yimin', 'Wang, Tong', 'Wang, Jingfeng', 'Chen, Wei-qing', 'Huang, Hui']","['Chen J', 'Liu Y', 'Cai Q', 'Liu Y', 'Wang T', 'Wang J', 'Chen WQ', 'Huang H']","['Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131211,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'China', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/*etiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Mothers/psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Prevalence', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Type D Personality']",,2013/12/12 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-013-2082-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2014 May;22(5):1277-86. doi: 10.1007/s00520-013-2082-2.

Despite advanced disease at initial presentation and extensive tumor spreading during the course of the disease, he presented with unusually mild symptoms. The scarcity of lung cancer in people with intellectual disability, and particularly those with Down syndrome, is due, in part, to reduced tobacco use.

We investigated the prognostic relevance of GAS6 expression, encoding the common TAM RTK ligand, in 270 adults (n=71 aged<60 years; n=199 aged 60 years) with de novo cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Patients expressing GAS6 (GAS6+), especially those aged 60 years, more often failed to achieve a complete remission (CR). In all patients, GAS6+ patients had shorter disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survival than patients without GAS6 expression (GAS6-). After adjusting for other prognostic markers, GAS6+ predicted CR failure (P=0.02), shorter DFS (P=0.004) and OS (P=0.04). To gain further biological insights, we derived a GAS6-associated gene-expression signature (P<0.001) that in GAS6+ patients included overexpressed BAALC and MN1, known to confer adverse prognosis in CN-AML, and overexpressed CXCL12, encoding stromal cell-derived factor, and its receptor genes, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and CXCR7. This study reports for the first time that GAS6 expression is an adverse prognostic marker in CN-AML. Although GAS6 decoy receptors are not yet available in the clinic for GAS6+ CN-AML therapy, potential alternative therapies targeting GAS6+-associated pathways, for example, CXCR4 antagonists, may be considered for GAS6+ patients to sensitize them to chemotherapy.","['Whitman, Susan P', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Mendler, Jason H', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Park, Il-Kyoo', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Whitman SP', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Maharry K', 'Volinia S', 'Mrozek K', 'Nicolet D', 'Schwind S', 'Becker H', 'Metzeler KH', 'Mendler JH', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Carroll AJ', 'Powell BL', 'Carter TH', 'Baer MR', 'Kolitz JE', 'Park IK', 'Stone RM', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'The Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131211,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ACKR3 protein, human)', '0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (growth arrest-specific protein 6)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC4047202,2013/12/12 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2013.371 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1252-1258. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.371.

IL-15 signals through a heterotrimeric receptor involving the common gamma chain (gammac) shared with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-21, IL-2/IL-15 receptor beta (IL-15Rbeta) shared with IL-2 and a private IL-15Ralpha subunit. IFN- or CD40 ligand-stimulated dendritic cells coordinately express IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha. Cell surface IL-15Ralpha presents IL-15 in trans to cells that express IL-2/IL-15Rbeta and gammac. IL-15 is being used to treat patients with metastatic malignancy. However, IL-15 is an inflammatory cytokine involved in immunological memory including that to self, thereby playing a role in autoimmune diseases. These insights provide the scientific basis for clinical strategies directed toward diminishing IL-15 action. Dysregulated IL-15 expression was demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, celiac disease, and alopecia areata. The monoclonal antibody Hu-Mik-beta-1 targets the cytokine receptor subunit IL-2/IL-15Rbeta (CD122), blocks IL-15 transpresentation, and is being used in clinical trials in patients with autoimmune diseases. In parallel, clinical trials have been initiated involving the Jak2/3 (Janus kinase-2/3) inhibitor tofacitinib and Jak1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to block IL-15 signaling.","['Waldmann, Thomas A']",['Waldmann TA'],"['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc,The journal of investigative dermatology.

Thus, we assessed the clinical and biological phenotypes of LGL leukemia associated with vasculitis. RESULTS: We studied a series of 11 patients displaying LGL leukemia associated with vasculitis (LAV). The mean age at diagnosis of LGL leukemia was 60.3 years; there were nine women and two men. The mean follow-up period was 45 months. The main LGL lineage was T-LGL (10 patients), and only one NK-LGL was identified. Clinical and biological features of T-LGL leukemia were compared with those from the 2009 French T-LGL registry. We did not find any relevant differences except that patients with LAV were predominantly female (p < 0.05). The most frequently observed vasculitis was cryoglobulinemia (n = 5). Three patients presented with cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, two patients had ANCA-negative microscopic polyangiitis, and one patient had giant cell arteritis. The main clinical features involved the skin, e.g., purpura (91%), arthralgia (37%), peripheral neuritis (27%), and renal glomerulonephritis (18%). The most frequent histologic finding was leucocytoclastic vasculitis (54%). The rate of complete remission was high; i.e., 80%. A minority of patients had a vasculitis relapse (27%). Three patients (27%) died; one death was related to LGL leukemia (acute infection) and the two other deaths were related to vasculitis (both with heart failure). CONCLUSION: We conclude that vasculitis is overrepresented in the population of LGL patients, LAV predominantly affects women, vasculitis preferentially affects the small vessels, and LAV has high rate of complete response.","['Audemard, Alexandra', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Bareau, Benoit', 'Sicre, Flore', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Truquet, Florence', 'Salaun, Veronique', 'Macro, Magaret', 'Verneuil, Laurence', 'Lobbedez, Thierry', 'Castrale, Cindy', 'Boutemy, Jonathan', 'Cheze, Stephane', 'Geffray, Loik', 'Schleinitz, Nicolas', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Lazaro, Estibaliz', 'Guillevin, Loic', 'Bienvenu, Boris']","['Audemard A', 'Lamy T', 'Bareau B', 'Sicre F', 'Suarez F', 'Truquet F', 'Salaun V', 'Macro M', 'Verneuil L', 'Lobbedez T', 'Castrale C', 'Boutemy J', 'Cheze S', 'Geffray L', 'Schleinitz N', 'Rey J', 'Lazaro E', 'Guillevin L', 'Bienvenu B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, CHU Caen, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vasculitis/*complications/drug therapy']",,2013/12/12 06:00,2014/08/22 06:00,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-0172(13)00150-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semarthrit.2013.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2013 Dec;43(3):362-6. doi: 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2013.07.002.,,['NOTNLM'],"['LGL leukemia', 'Large granular lymphocyte leukemia', 'Vasculitis']",,,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The effect of polyphyllin D on K562/A02 cells were analysed by studying their cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, caspase-3 activity and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). KEY FINDINGS: Polyphyllin D, a small molecular monomer extracted from rhizoma of Paris polyphyllin, exhibited strong anticancer activity in a previous study. Our results demonstrate that polyphyllin D exerts a growth inhibitory effect by arresting cells at G2/M phase and by the induction of apoptosis in K562/A02 human leukaemia drug-resistant cells, G2/M phase arrest was found to be associated with up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1. Polyphyllin D-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as evidenced by decreased Bcl-2 expression levels, disruption of MMP and increased Bax, cytochrome C and cleaved-caspase-3 levels.

The objective of this work was to design a methodology to improve the automatic classification of abnormal lymphoid cells. METHODS: We analyzed 340 digital images of individual lymphoid cells from PB films obtained in the CellaVision DM96:150 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, 100 hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells, and 90 normal lymphocytes (N). We implemented the Watershed Transformation to segment the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the peripheral cell region. We extracted 44 features and then the clustering Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) was applied in two steps for the lymphocyte classification. RESULTS: The images were automatically clustered in three groups, one of them with 98% of the HCL cells. The set of the remaining cells was clustered again using FCM and texture features. The two new groups contained 83.3% of the N cells and 71.3% of the CLL cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: The approach has been able to automatically classify with high precision three types of lymphoid cells.

Over the past several decades, investigators have made great advances in the research of PDAC pathogenesis. Importantly, identification of pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs) in pancreatic cancer cases has increased our understanding of PDAC biology and therapy. PCSCs are responsible for pancreatic tumorigenesis and tumor progression via a number of mechanisms, including extensive proliferation, self-renewal, high tumorigenic ability, high propensity for invasiveness and metastasis, and resistance to conventional treatment. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that PCSCs are involved in the malignant transformation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The molecular mechanisms that control PCSCs are related to alterations of various signaling pathways, for instance, Hedgehog, Notch, Wnt, B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, and Nodal/Activin. Also, authors have reported that the proliferation-specific transcriptional factor Forkhead box protein M1 is involved in PCSC self-renewal and proliferation. In this review, we describe the current knowledge about the signaling pathways related to PCSCs and the early stages of PDAC development, highlighting the pivotal roles of Forkhead box protein M1 in PCSCs and their impacts on the development and progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.","['Quan, Ming', 'Wang, Peipei', 'Cui, Jiujie', 'Gao, Yong', 'Xie, Keping']","['Quan M', 'Wang P', 'Cui J', 'Gao Y', 'Xie K']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. kepxie@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20131210,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3924162,2013/12/12 06:00,2014/07/18 06:00,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-159 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-159 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 Dec 10;12:159. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-159.,,,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA130821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA129956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA172233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA148954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA152309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed exome sequencing of samples obtained from 151 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. The mutation status of the gene encoding calreticulin (CALR) was assessed in an additional 1345 hematologic cancers, 1517 other cancers, and 550 controls. We established phylogenetic trees using hematopoietic colonies. We assessed calreticulin subcellular localization using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Exome sequencing identified 1498 mutations in 151 patients, with medians of 6.5, 6.5, and 13.0 mutations per patient in samples of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis, respectively. Somatic CALR mutations were found in 70 to 84% of samples of myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated JAK2, in 8% of myelodysplasia samples, in occasional samples of other myeloid cancers, and in none of the other cancers. A total of 148 CALR mutations were identified with 19 distinct variants. Mutations were located in exon 9 and generated a +1 base-pair frameshift, which would result in a mutant protein with a novel C-terminal. Mutant calreticulin was observed in the endoplasmic reticulum without increased cell-surface or Golgi accumulation. Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms carrying CALR mutations presented with higher platelet counts and lower hemoglobin levels than patients with mutated JAK2. Mutation of CALR was detected in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Clonal analyses showed CALR mutations in the earliest phylogenetic node, a finding consistent with its role as an initiating mutation in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone CALR were found in a majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated JAK2.

So far, no specific molecular marker has been identified in the remaining 30 to 45% of patients. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing to identify somatically acquired mutations in six patients who had primary myelofibrosis without mutations in JAK2 or MPL. Resequencing of CALR, encoding calreticulin, was then performed in cohorts of patients with myeloid neoplasms. RESULTS: Somatic insertions or deletions in exon 9 of CALR were detected in all patients who underwent whole-exome sequencing. Resequencing in 1107 samples from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms showed that CALR mutations were absent in polycythemia vera. In essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, CALR mutations and JAK2 and MPL mutations were mutually exclusive. Among patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis with nonmutated JAK2 or MPL, CALR mutations were detected in 67% of those with essential thrombocythemia and 88% of those with primary myelofibrosis. A total of 36 types of insertions or deletions were identified that all cause a frameshift to the same alternative reading frame and generate a novel C-terminal peptide in the mutant calreticulin. Overexpression of the most frequent CALR deletion caused cytokine-independent growth in vitro owing to the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) by means of an unknown mechanism. Patients with mutated CALR had a lower risk of thrombosis and longer overall survival than patients with mutated JAK2. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis that was not associated with a JAK2 or MPL alteration carried a somatic mutation in CALR. The clinical course in these patients was more indolent than that in patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation.

Among the secondary side effects of chemotherapy, mucositis is the most frequent complication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of herpes viruses HSV-1, EBV, and CMV and the presence and severity of oral mucositis in children and adolescents diagnosed with ALL. METHODOLOGY: Ninety-two patients diagnosed with ALL were evaluated. Serum samples were collected before chemotherapy and tested by ELISA method. Presence of mucositis was observed on the first day before antineoplastic therapy (D0) and on 7th day post-therapy (D7). Classification of mucositis intensity was performed according to toxicity criteria established by the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: 70.7% of the patients presented mucositis on the D7, and of these, 60% were classified as Grade I and 40% as Grade II; of the 92 individuals tested, 59 (64.1%) presented antibodies for HSV-1, 57 (62%) for EBV, 75 (81.5%) for CMV_IgG, and 21 (22.8%) for CMV_IgM. Using a logistic regression model, the presence of HSV-1 was observed to be 4.10 times greater in Grade II mucositis severity than in Grade I (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, it was possible to conclude that infection by the herpes viruses HSV-1, EBV, and CMV is ubiquitous in the studied population and that HSV-1 may be a risk factor for aggravating the severity of mucositis.","['Santos de Faria, Andreza Barkokebas', 'Silva, Igor Henrique Moraes', 'de Godoy Almeida, Roberta', 'Silva, Sirleide Pereira da', 'Carvalho, Alessandra Tavares', 'Leao, Jair Carneiro']","['Santos de Faria AB', 'Silva IH', 'de Godoy Almeida R', 'Silva SP', 'Carvalho AT', 'Leao JC']","['Departamento de Clinicae Odontologia Preventiva, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131210,Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/epidemiology', 'Herpesviridae/*classification', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/classification/*virology', 'Viral Load']",,2013/12/12 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2013/12/12 06:00'],"['2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jop.12138 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2014 Apr;43(4):298-303. doi: 10.1111/jop.12138.

The transcription levels of apoptosis-related BCL-2, BAX and C-MYC genes were determined by RT-PCR. The translation levels of those genes were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with normal controls and the HL-60 cells infected with Ad-KZ, the mRNA and protein expression levels of PML(NLS-) gene increased significantly in the HL-60 cells infected with Ad-PML( NLS-). Increased proliferation levels of the Ad-PML (NLS-) infected HL-60 cells were observed in those treated with 60 pmol/L emodin, which showed decreased percentage of cells at Gx phase, increased percentage of cells at S phase, and decreased emodin-induced apoptosis. The levels of mRNA transcription and protein expression of BAX gene decreased, while those of BCL-2 and C-MYC genes increased significantly. CONCLUSION: The over-expression of PML(NLS-) gene might promote the proliferation and arrest the apoptosis of HL-60 cells by up-regulating the expressions of BCL-2 and C-MYC genes and down-regulating the expression of BAX gene.","['Gao, Yuan-Mei', 'Liu, Bei-Zhong', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Hu, Xiu-Xiu', 'Zhong, Liang']","['Gao YM', 'Liu BZ', 'Zhang X', 'Hu XX', 'Zhong L']","['Central Laboratory of Yong-chuan Hospital Affiliated Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

The Ikaros gene family, encoding for key transcription factors in hematopoietic development, provides several examples as genetic defects in these genes are associated with the development of different types of leukemia. However, the complex patterns of expression of isoforms in Ikaros family genes has prevented their use as clinical markers. In this study, we propose the use of the expression profiles of the Ikaros isoforms to classify various hematological tumor diseases. We have standardized a quantitative PCR protocol to estimate the expression levels of the Ikaros gene exons. Our analysis reveals that these levels are associated with specific types of leukemia and we have found differences in the levels of expression relative to five interexonic Ikaros regions for all diseases studied. In conclusion, our method has allowed us to precisely discriminate between B-ALL, CLL and MM cases. Differences between the groups of lymphoid and myeloid pathologies were also identified in the same way.","['Orozco, Carlos A', 'Acevedo, Andres', 'Cortina, Lazaro', 'Cuellar, Gina E', 'Duarte, Monica', 'Martin, Liliana', 'Mesa, Nestor M', 'Munoz, Javier', 'Portilla, Carlos A', 'Quijano, Sandra M', 'Quintero, Guillermo', 'Rodriguez, Miriam', 'Saavedra, Carlos E', 'Groot, Helena', 'Torres, Maria M', 'Lopez-Segura, Valeriano']","['Orozco CA', 'Acevedo A', 'Cortina L', 'Cuellar GE', 'Duarte M', 'Martin L', 'Mesa NM', 'Munoz J', 'Portilla CA', 'Quijano SM', 'Quintero G', 'Rodriguez M', 'Saavedra CE', 'Groot H', 'Torres MM', 'Lopez-Segura V']","['Laboratory of Human Genetics, Los Andes University, Bogota, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131206,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', '*Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3855751,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/08/01 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0082411 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-25222 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 6;8(12):e82411. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082411. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding this process is important for regenerative medicine applications that require in vitro production of HSC. In this study we investigated the effects of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during early embryonic differentiation and hematopoietic specification using an embryonic stem cell system. Our data clearly demonstrates that following early differentiation induction, canonical Wnt signaling induces a strong mesodermal program whilst maintaining a degree of stemness potential. This involved a complex interplay between beta-catenin/TCF/LEF/Brachyury/Nanog. beta-catenin mediated up-regulation of TCF/LEF resulted in enhanced brachyury levels, which in-turn lead to Nanog up-regulation. During differentiation, active canonical Wnt signaling also up-regulated key transcription factors and cell specific markers essential for hematopoietic specification, in particular genes involved in establishing primitive erythropoiesis. This led to a significant increase in primitive erythroid colony formation. beta-catenin signaling also augmented early hematopoietic and multipotent progenitor (MPP) formation. Following culture in a MPP specific cytokine cocktail, activation of beta-catenin suppressed differentiation of the early hematopoietic progenitor population, with cells displaying a higher replating capacity and a propensity to form megakaryocytic erythroid progenitors. This bias towards erythroid lineage commitment was also observed when hematopoietic progenitors were directed to undergo myeloid colony formation. Overall this study underscores the importance of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mesodermal specification, primitive erythropoiesis and early hematopietic progenitor formation during hematopoietic induction.","['Tarafdar, Anuradha', 'Dobbin, Edwina', 'Corrigan, Pamela', 'Freeburn, Robin', 'Wheadon, Helen']","['Tarafdar A', 'Dobbin E', 'Corrigan P', 'Freeburn R', 'Wheadon H']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom ; Biomedical Science Institute, University of Ulster, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131126,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3850021,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081030 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-24819 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 26;8(11):e81030. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081030. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study to assess the efficacy of single low-dose regimen of rasburicase in controlling hyperuricaemia in patients with tumour lysis syndrome due to haematological malignancies.,378,10.3332/ecancer.2013.378 [doi],"We conducted a retrospective audit of six patients with various haematological malignancies (two acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, one acute myeloid leukaemia, and three non-Hodgkin lymphoma); these patients were eligible to receive rasburicase, being at high risk of development of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). They received a fixed single low-dose regimen of rasburicase (7.5 mg) mainly due to financial restriction, as patients were not supported by the National Health Service and did not have health insurance. We compared uric acid, creatinine levels, and electrolytes (i.e. phosphate, potassium, and calcium) before and after rasburicase administration and also assessed the need for renal replacement therapy after treatment. All six patients had a significant reduction in uric acid levels on the first day, achieving a response rate of 100% (p = 0.008994); creatinine, phosphate, and potassium were reduced significantly as well, with the p values of 0.0439, 0.014326, and 0.002008, respectively; only one patient needed renal replacement therapy in the form of haemodialysis, due to concerns about hyperphosphataemia. Financial difficulties faced either because patients lacked insurance or because of the restricted National Health Service budget in Egypt have resulted in the unavailability of certain modalities of treatment in cancer care and the need to consider more economic yet efficient approaches. Our experience suggests that a single low-dose rasburicase injection (7.5 mg) is an efficient and cost-effective method to control hyperuricaemia in patients with a high risk of developing TLS when compared with the more expensive and extended standard regimen and doses recommended.","['Azim, Hamdy A', 'Bahr, Sherif Ahmed', 'Kamal, Nermine Shawky', 'Koura, Mohamed Adel', 'Tolba, Rehab', 'Gad, Heba Abdelmoneem', 'Morsy, Ahmad', 'Attia, Hossameldin Mohsen', 'Iskander, Ibraheem', 'Hammad, Ahmed', 'Hemed, Mohammed Farouk', 'Abdallah, Mohammed Fathy', 'Sadek, Kareem Ahmed', 'Taha, Alaa Hamdi']","['Azim HA', 'Bahr SA', 'Kamal NS', 'Koura MA', 'Tolba R', 'Gad HA', 'Morsy A', 'Attia HM', 'Iskander I', 'Hammad A', 'Hemed MF', 'Abdallah MF', 'Sadek KA', 'Taha AH']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt ; Clinical Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Manial Specialized University Hospital, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20131210,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,,,,PMC3855003,2013/12/11 06:00,2013/12/11 06:01,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2013.378 [doi]', 'can-7-378 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2013 Dec 10;7:378. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2013.378. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['haemological malignancies', 'hyperuricaemia', 'single dose of rasburicase', 'tumour lysis syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Expert Group of the 4(th) European Conference on Infections in Leukemia has developed guidelines for initial empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients, based on: i) the local resistance epidemiology; and ii) the patient's risk factors for resistant bacteria and for a complicated clinical course. An 'escalation' approach, avoiding empirical carbapenems and combinations, should be employed in patients without particular risk factors. A 'de-escalation' approach, with initial broad-spectrum antibiotics or combinations, should be used only in those patients with: i) known prior colonization or infection with resistant pathogens; or ii) complicated presentation; or iii) in centers where resistant pathogens are prevalent at the onset of febrile neutropenia. In the latter case, infection control and antibiotic stewardship also need urgent review. Modification of the initial regimen at 72-96 h should be based on the patient's clinical course and the microbiological results. Discontinuation of antibiotics after 72 h or later should be considered in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin who are hemodynamically stable since presentation and afebrile for at least 48 h, irrespective of neutrophil count and expected duration of neutropenia.

The coexistence and coevolution of CLL cells with their tissue neighbors provided the basis for discovery of critical cellular and molecular drivers of the disease and identification of new therapeutic targets. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), monocyte-derived nurselike cells (NLC), and T cells are key players in the CLL microenvironment, which activate and protect CLL cells within the tissues. CLL surface molecules, such as the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules, and TNF receptor superfamily members (e.g., CD40, BCMA, and BAFF-R) engage in cross-talk with respective tissue ligands. This cross-talk results in survival and expansion of the CLL clone, and protects CLL cells from conventional cytotoxic drugs. Inhibiting these pathways represents an alternative therapeutic strategy to more conventional chemoimmunotherapy. Here, we review central components of the CLL microenvironment, with a particular emphasis on BCR signaling, and we summarize the most relevant clinical advances with inhibitors that target the BCR-associated spleen tyrosine kinase/SYK (fostamatinib), Bruton's tyrosine kinase/BTK (ibrutinib), and PI3Kdelta (idelalisib).","['ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Burger, Jan A']","['ten Hacken E', 'Burger JA']","[""Authors' Affiliation: Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20131209,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*physiology']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-0226 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0226 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Feb 1;20(3):548-56. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0226.

We searched for biological active substances for the prevention and treatment of ATL from several species of herbs. The ATL cell growth-inhibitory activity and apoptosis assay showed that carnosol, which is an ingredient contained in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), induced apoptosis in ATL cells. Next, to investigate the apoptosis-inducing mechanism of carnosol, we applied proteomic analysis using fluorescent two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The proteomic analysis showed that the expression of reductases, enzymes in glycolytic pathway, and enzymes in pentose phosphate pathway was increased in carnosol-treated cells, compared with untreated cells. These results suggested that carnosol affected the redox status in the cells. Further, the quantitative analysis of glutathione, which plays the central role for the maintenance of intracellular redox status, indicated that carnosol caused the decrease of glutathione in the cells. Further, N-acetyl-L-cystein, which is precursor of glutathione, canceled the efficiency of carnosol. From these results, it was suggested that the apoptosis-inducing activity of carnosol in ATL cells was caused by the depletion of glutathione.","['Ishida, Yo-ichi', 'Yamasaki, Masao', 'Yukizaki, Chizuko', 'Nishiyama, Kazuo', 'Tsubouchi, Hirohito', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Kataoka, Hiroaki']","['Ishida Y', 'Yamasaki M', 'Yukizaki C', 'Nishiyama K', 'Tsubouchi H', 'Okayama A', 'Kataoka H']","['Department of Biochemistry, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo, 204-8588, Japan, ishida@my-pharm.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131210,Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Abietanes)', '483O455CKD (carnosol)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Abietanes/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/*methods', 'Glutathione/deficiency/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway/drug effects', 'Phytotherapy', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Rosmarinus/*chemistry']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13577-013-0083-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Cell. 2014 Apr;27(2):68-77. doi: 10.1007/s13577-013-0083-6.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The protein content in the plasma of 100 patients suffering from the three most common B-cell lymphomas and 100 control samples was studied with antibody microarrays composed of 810 antibodies that target cancer-associated proteins. Sample pools were screened for an identification of marker proteins. Then, the samples were analyzed individually to validate the usability of these markers. RESULTS: More than 200 proteins with disease-associated abundance changes were found. The evaluation on individual patients confirmed some molecules as robust informative markers while others were inadequate for this purpose. In addition, the analysis revealed distinct subgroups for each of the three investigated B-cell lymphoma subtypes. With this information, we delineated a classifier that discriminates the different lymphoma entities. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Variations in plasma protein abundance permit discrimination between different patient groups. After validation on a larger study cohort, the findings could have diagnostic as well as differential diagnostic potential. Beside this, methodological aspects were critically evaluated, such as the value of sample pooling for the identification of biomarkers that are useful for a diagnosis on individual patients.","['Schroder, Christoph', 'Srinivasan, Harish', 'Sill, Martin', 'Linseisen, Jakob', 'Fellenberg, Kurt', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Hoheisel, Jorg D']","['Schroder C', 'Srinivasan H', 'Sill M', 'Linseisen J', 'Fellenberg K', 'Becker N', 'Nieters A', 'Hoheisel JD']","['Division of Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics Clin Appl,Proteomics.

Observer agreement using the GSQ method in this age group has not been described. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate observer agreement on vertebral readability and vertebral fracture diagnosis using the GSQ method in pediatric vertebral morphometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spine radiographs of 186 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were evaluated independently by three radiologists using the same GSQ methodology as in adults. A subset of 100 radiographs was evaluated on two occasions. RESULTS: An average of 4.7% of vertebrae were unreadable for the three radiologists. Intraobserver Cohen's kappa (kappa) on readability ranged from 0.434 to 0.648 at the vertebral level and from 0.416 to 0.611 at the patient level, while interobserver kappa for readability had a range of 0.330 to 0.504 at the vertebral level and 0.295 to 0.467 at the patient level. Intraobserver kappa for the presence of vertebral fracture had a range of 0.529 to 0.726 at the vertebral level and was 0.528 to 0.767 at the patient level. Interobserver kappa for fracture at the vertebral level ranged from 0.455 to 0.548 and from 0.433 to 0.486 at the patient level. CONCLUSION: Most kappa values for both intra- and interobserver agreement in applying the GSQ method to pediatric spine radiographs were in the moderate to substantial range, comparable to the performance of the technique in adult studies. The GSQ method should be considered for use in pediatric research and clinical practice.","['Siminoski, Kerry', 'Lentle, Brian', 'Matzinger, Mary Ann', 'Shenouda, Nazih', 'Ward, Leanne M']","['Siminoski K', 'Lentle B', 'Matzinger MA', 'Shenouda N', 'Ward LM']","['Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging and Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, 6628-123 St., Edmonton, Canada, T6H 3T6, kerrygs@telusplanet.net.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131210,Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Observer Variation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Radiography', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spinal Fractures/*diagnostic imaging/*etiology']",PMC3900460,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00247-013-2837-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2014 Apr;44(4):457-66. doi: 10.1007/s00247-013-2837-4.

Here, we demonstrate preferential selection of CD8(+) thymocytes from in vitro differentiation of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes exhibiting the characteristics of nonconventional innate memory CD8(+) cells. In contrast to conventional CD8(+) thymocytes, these culture-differentiated CD8(+) cells are eomesodermin positive and robustly express CXCR3, CD44, CD122 and TLR2. Interestingly, the pathogen-associated molecule porin promotes preferential differentiation of the CD8(+) single-positive subset in association with promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger upregulation and interleukin (IL)-4 production. On priming with anti-CD3 antibody, porin augmented TLR2 and IFN-gamma indicating a role of the TLR ligand in acquisition of innate memory response of CD8(+) thymocytes. In addition, porin has a cooperative role with IL-15 on the expansion of memory-phenotype CD8(+) T cells along with its effector function. Thus, the study opens an avenue to unfold the cues for development of these cells and the strategies adopted for bolstering immunity during primary infection.","['Biswas, Ratna', 'Mukherjee, Subhadeep', 'Sinha, Debolina', 'Ghosh, Amlan Kanti', 'Biswas, Tapas']","['Biswas R', 'Mukherjee S', 'Sinha D', 'Ghosh AK', 'Biswas T']","['Division of Immunology, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, India.', 'Division of Immunology, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, India.', 'Division of Immunology, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, India.', 'Division of Immunology, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, India.', 'Division of Immunology, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131210,United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Porins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects/*immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/drug effects/*immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Porins/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Thymocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['icb201394 [pii]', '10.1038/icb.2013.94 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2014 Apr;92(4):368-76. doi: 10.1038/icb.2013.94.

We investigated loss of major molecular response (MMR) as a criterion for resuming therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter observational study (A-STIM [According to Stop Imatinib]) evaluating MMR persistence was conducted in 80 patients with CP-CML who had stopped imatinib after prolonged CMR. RESULTS: Median time from imatinib initiation to discontinuation was 79 months (range, 30 to 145 months);median duration of CMR before imatinib discontinuation was 41 months (range, 24 to 96 months); median follow-up after discontinuation was 31 months (range, 8 to 92 months). Twenty-nine patients (36%) lost MMR after a median of 4 months off therapy (range, 2 to 17 months). Cumulative incidence of MMR loss was estimated as 35% (95% CI, 25% to 46%) at 12 months and 36% (95% CI, 26% to 47%) at 24 months, whereas probability of losing CMR was higher. Fluctuation of BCR-ABL transcript levels below the MMR threshold (>/= two consecutive positive values) was observed in 31% of patients after imatinib discontinuation. Treatment-free remission was estimated as 64% (95% CI, 54% to 75%) at 12 and 24 months and 61% (95% CI, 51% to 73%) at 36 months. Median to time to second CMR was estimated as 7.3 months in re-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Loss of MMR is a practical and safe criterion for restarting therapy in patients with CML with prolonged CMR.","['Rousselot, Philippe', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Agape, Philippe', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Varet, Bruno', 'Gardembas, Martine', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Tulliez, Michel', 'Prost, Stephane', 'Spentchian, Marc', 'Cayuela, Jean Michel', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Chomel, Jean Claude', 'Turhan, Ali', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Rousselot P', 'Charbonnier A', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Agape P', 'Nicolini FE', 'Varet B', 'Gardembas M', 'Etienne G', 'Rea D', 'Roy L', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Tulliez M', 'Prost S', 'Spentchian M', 'Cayuela JM', 'Reiffers J', 'Chomel JC', 'Turhan A', 'Guilhot J', 'Guilhot F', 'Mahon FX']","[""Philippe Rousselot, Hopital Mignot, Universite Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Versailles; Aude Charbonnier, Institut Paoli Calmette, Marseille; Pascale Cony-Makhoul, Hopital d'Annecy, Pringy; Philippe Agape, Hopital Felix Guyon-Centre Hospitalier Universitaire en France (CHU) de la Reunion, La Reunion; Franck E.

RESULTS: RFS was significantly worse in Vietnamese children (hazards ratio=4.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.16-9.3; P<0.01). The 5-year RFS was 83.8% (95% CI, 76.3%-92.0%) and 47.8% (95% CI, 35.6%-64.2%) for white and Vietnamese children, respectively. In the latter group, relapses occurred in bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid at a much earlier stage. The outcome was compared at first relapse only because of different treatments afterward, according to the country. Both series were similar for sex, age at diagnosis, initial white blood cell count, cytogenetic abnormalities, and corticosensitivity at day 8. Higher frequency of L2-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P<0.001) but lower frequency of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P=0.004) were observed in Vietnamese children. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors may contribute to the poor RFS in Vietnamese children, which include the time interval before the first intrathecal therapy and differences in the management of drug-related toxicity. However, additional contribution of socioeconomic factors and/or variations in pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in Vietnamese patients cannot currently be ruled out.","['Vu Hoang, Phuong Thu', 'Ambroise, Jerome', 'Dang Chi, Vu Luan', 'Dekairelle, Anne-France', 'Dupont, Sophie', 'Huynh, Nghia', 'Nguyen, Tan Binh', 'Robert, Annie', 'Gala, Jean-Luc', 'Vermylen, Christiane']","['Vu Hoang PT', 'Ambroise J', 'Dang Chi VL', 'Dekairelle AF', 'Dupont S', 'Huynh N', 'Nguyen TB', 'Robert A', 'Gala JL', 'Vermylen C']","['*Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc daggerCentre de Technologies Moleculaires Appliquees (CTMA) parallelEpidemiology and Biostatistics Department, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite catholique de Louvain (UCL) paragraph signDefence Laboratories Department, Belgian Armed Forces, Brussels, Belgium double daggerPham Ngoc Thach University of Medecin section signBlood Transfusion and Hematology Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asians/*statistics & numerical data', 'Belgium/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/ethnology/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vietnam/epidemiology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000062 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Oct;36(7):534-40. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After initial HSCT, they subsequently received high-dose Ara-C (3 g/m IV) every 12 hours on days -8 through -3 and mitoxantrone (10 mg/m/d IV) on days -8, -7, -6 followed by second HSCT from their original donors. All 5 patients are alive at 88, 179, 199, 234, and 246 months with no evidence of JMML, no significant toxicity, and 100% donor chimera as determined by PCR short-tandem repeat analysis. Our experience supports second transplant utilizing high-dose Ara-C and mitoxantrone in children with JMML who do not respond or relapse after first transplant.","['Patel, Sachit A', 'Coulter, Don W', 'Grovas, Alfred C', 'Gordon, Bruce G', 'Harper, James L', 'Warkentin, Phyllis I', 'Wisecarver, James L', 'Sanger, Warren G', 'Coccia, Peter F']","['Patel SA', 'Coulter DW', 'Grovas AC', 'Gordon BG', 'Harper JL', 'Warkentin PI', 'Wisecarver JL', 'Sanger WG', 'Coccia PF']","['*Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation daggerDepartment of Pathology and Microbiology double daggerDivision of Clinical and Human Genetics, Munroe-Meyer Institute, The University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4048652,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000077 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Aug;36(6):491-4. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000077.,,,,,['T32 HL007057/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS555428'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is often accompanied by severe coagulopathy and bleeding risk and thus represents a potentially fatal haematological emergency requiring immediate treatment. Spontaneous splenic rupture is a rare event in all haematological malignancies. Only two clinical cases have been described so far in a setting of APL. CASE REPORT: We report a patient with APL without preceding splenomegaly who underwent urgent splenectomy for spontaneously occurring splenic rupture during induction chemotherapy. After surgery the patient completed induction chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. CONCLUSION: This is the second case of spontaneous splenic rupture without preceding splenomegaly in a patient with APL during induction chemotherapy described so far. Our case demonstrates that emergent splenectomy can be lifesaving even in the unfavourable condition of patient with severe immune deficiency.","['Kuba, Adam', 'Szotkowski, Tomas', 'Rohon, Peter', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Turcsanyi, Peter', 'Hubacek, Jaromir', 'Holzerova, Milena', 'Prasil, Vojtech', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Kuba A', 'Szotkowski T', 'Rohon P', 'Faber E', 'Turcsanyi P', 'Hubacek J', 'Holzerova M', 'Prasil V', 'Jarosova M', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131126,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Emergency Treatment', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rupture, Spontaneous/etiology/surgery', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenic Rupture/*etiology/surgery']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2013.086 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2015 Jun;159(2):294-8. doi: 10.5507/bp.2013.086.

Variations in ABCG2 activity might influence pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcome of TKIs. The role of ABCG2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TKI treatment is not clear and functional in-vitro studies are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of ABCG2 SNPs for transport and efficacy of TKIs [imatinib, N-desmethyl imatinib (CGP74588), dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib]. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ABCG2 SNPs 34G>A, 421C>A, 623T>C, 886G>C, 1574T>G, and 1582G>A were constructed from ABCG2 wild-type cDNA and transduced to K562 cells by retroviral gene transfer. Variant ABCG2 expression in cell membranes was evaluated and the effects of ABCG2 SNPs on transport and efficacy of TKIs were measured as the ability of ABCG2 variants to protect against TKI cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Wild-type ABCG2 had a protective effect against the cytotoxicity of all investigated compounds except bosutinib. It was found that ABCG2 expression provided better protection against CGP74588 than its parent compound, imatinib. ABCG2 421C>A, 623T>C, 886G>C, and 1574T>G reduced cell membrane expression of ABCG2 and the protective effect of ABCG2 against imatinib, CGP74588, dasatinib, and nilotinib cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the ABCG2 SNPs 421C>A, 623T>C, 886G>C, and 1574T>G increase the efficacy of investigated TKIs, indicating a reduced transport function that might influence TKI pharmacokinetics in vivo. Furthermore, the active imatinib metabolite CGP74588 is influenced by ABCG2 expression to a greater extent than the parent compound.","['Skoglund, Karin', 'Boiso Moreno, Samuel', 'Jonsson, Jan-Ingvar', 'Vikingsson, Svante', 'Carlsson, Bjorn', 'Green, Henrik']","['Skoglund K', 'Boiso Moreno S', 'Jonsson JI', 'Vikingsson S', 'Carlsson B', 'Green H']","['aDepartment of Medical and Health Sciences, Division of Drug Research/Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences bDepartment of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University cDivision of Drug Research/Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, County Council of Ostergotland dDepartment of Forensic Genetics and Forensic Toxicology, National Board of Forensic Medicine, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CGP 74588)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Aniline Compounds/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000022 [doi]', '01213011-201401000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2014 Jan;24(1):52-61. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because CLL is a highly radiosensitive cancer, we hypothesized that total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimens may be associated with better outcomes than those without TBI. To answer this, we analyzed data from 180 subjects with CLL receiving myeloablative doses of TBI (n = 126) or not (n = 54), who received transplants from an HLA-identical sibling donor between 1995 and 2007 and reported to the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research. At 5 years, treatment-related mortality was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39% to 57%) versus 50% (95% CI, 36% to 64%); P = NS. Relapse rates were 17% (95% CI, 11% to 25%) versus 22% (95% CI, 11% to 35%); P = NS. Five-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 34% (95% CI, 26% to 43%) versus 28% (95% CI, 15% to 42%); P = NS and 42% (95% CI, 33% to 51%) versus 33% (95% CI, 19% to 48%); P = NS, respectively. The single most common cause of death in both cohorts was recurrent/progressive CLL. No variable tested in the multivariate analysis was found to significantly affect these outcomes, including having failed fludarabine.

Our study was aimed at investigating SC2017 tumor growth-inhibiting activity and the underlying mechanisms in Jurkat cells (T-cell leukemia) and xenograft tumor models. METHODS: Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell cycle progression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation and apoptotic hallmarks were monitored by flow cytometry. Inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) by biochemical assays. Levels and/or activation status of signaling proteins were assessed by western blotting. Xenograft tumors were generated with HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells. RESULTS: SC2017 displayed cell growth-inhibiting activity against Jurkat cells (half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC50)<2muM), but low cell-killing potential in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The primary response of Jurkat cells to SC2017 was an arrest in G2 phase followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway and TrxR activity by SC2017 was demonstrated by biochemical and pharmacological approaches. At least, SC2017 was found to inhibit xenograft tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that SC2017 inhibits tumor cell growth in in vitro and in vivo models, but displays moderate toxicity against PBMC. We also demonstrate that SC2017 promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis in Jurkat cells by affecting Akt activation status and TrxR functionality.

In all vertebrates, the Runx1 gene is transcribed from two promoters: a proximal promoter (P2), and a distal promoter (P1). We previously found that runx1 expression in a specific hematopoietic cell population in zebrafish embryos depends on cohesin. Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2. Cohesin initiates expression of runx1 in the posterior lateral mesoderm and influences promoter use, while CTCF represses its expression in the newly emerging cells of the tail bud. The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay. The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). CTCF depletion excluded RNAPII from two intronic CREs but not the promoters of runx1. We propose that cohesin and CTCF have distinct functions in the regulation of runx1 during zebrafish embryogenesis, and that these regulatory functions are likely to involve runx1 intronic CREs. Cohesin (but not CTCF) depletion enhanced RUNX1 expression in a human leukemia cell line, suggesting conservation of RUNX1 regulation through evolution.","['Marsman, Judith', ""O'Neill, Adam C"", 'Kao, Betty Rui-Yun', 'Rhodes, Jenny M', 'Meier, Michael', 'Antony, Jisha', 'Monnich, Maren', 'Horsfield, Julia A']","['Marsman J', ""O'Neill AC"", 'Kao BR', 'Rhodes JM', 'Meier M', 'Antony J', 'Monnich M', 'Horsfield JA']","['Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, The University of Otago, P.O.

XB05 displayed potent antiproliferative activity against cell lines derived from leukemia or solid tumors, but had less effect on nonmalignant cells. To identify factors that contribute to the cancer selectivity of XB05, we chose three cell lines that had high sensitivity to XB05 (U937 leukemia), moderate sensitivity (A549 lung cancer), or low sensitivity (Hs27 nonmalignant skin fibroblasts), and proceeded to assess cell death and oxidative stress in these cells. XB05 was found to induce cell death via both apoptotic and nonapoptotic mechanisms in U937 and A549 cells, whereas it had no cytotoxicity against Hs27 cells at comparable concentrations. Treatment with XB05 caused an increase in reactive oxygen species in all cell lines tested, but levels were higher in malignant compared to nonmalignant cells. XB05 treatment also induced DNA damage exclusively in the malignant cells. Differences in antioxidant responses were observed between cell lines. For example, XB05 caused a decrease in levels of glutathione and nuclear Nrf2 in the most sensitive cells (U937), whereas the least sensitive cells (Hs27) displayed increased glutathione levels and no change in nuclear Nrf2. XB05 could react in vitro with cysteine and glutathione, but had much lower reactivity compared to typical thiol-reactive electrophiles, diethyl maleate and maleimide. In summary, XB05 is a novel compound that selectively kills malignant cells, most likely by disrupting cellular redox homeostasis, making it a promising candidate for development as a chemotherapeutic agent.","['Salipur, Francesca R', 'Reyes-Reyes, E Merit', 'Xu, Bo', 'Hammond, Gerald B', 'Bates, Paula J']","['Salipur FR', 'Reyes-Reyes EM', 'Xu B', 'Hammond GB', 'Bates PJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA; Molecular Targets Program of the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.', 'Molecular Targets Program of the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA; Molecular Targets Program of the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.

METHODS: The mouse ELSC14.5 cells were randomly divided into two groups: control group and experimental group, which were infected with two adenovirus vectors expressing green fluorescent protein, Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-wnt3a, respectively. The mRNA and protein expressions of Wnt3a and apoptosis-related factors Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bax were examined by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting respectively. Cell apoptosis was tested by annexin-PE/7-ADD and Hoechst 33258 staining method.

The anti CD33 immunoconjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), was withdrawn with concerns over induction mortality and lack of efficacy. However a number of recent trials suggest that, particularly in AML with favourable cytogenetics, GO may improve overall survival. This data and the development of alternative novel monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have renewed interest in the area. Leukaemic stem cells (LSC) are identified as the subset of AML blasts that reproduces the leukaemic phenotype upon transplantation into immunosuppressed mice. AML relapse may be caused by chemoresistant LSC and this has refocused interest on identifying and targeting antigens specific for LSC. Several mAb have been developed that target LSC effectively in xenogeneic models but only a few have begun clinical evaluation. Antibody engineering may improve the activity of potential new therapeutics for AML. The encouraging results seen with bispecific T cell-engaging mAb-based molecules against CD19 in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphobalstic leukaemia, highlight the potential efficacy of engineered antibodies in the treatment of acute leukaemia.

The two most common situations involving immunosuppression-associated skin cancer are solid organ transplantation and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with lymphoma are more likely to have development of a secondary malignancy, with skin cancer being the most common. The most common types of skin cancer in patients with NHL/CLL include melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. Many skin cancers demonstrate increased aggressiveness in patients with NHL/CLL and are associated with higher recurrence rates, increased regional metastasis, and death secondary to skin cancer metastases.

METHODS: Four patients treated with TMI and TMLI were randomly selected from the internal database. Plans were optimized with VMAT technique. Planning target volume (PTV) included all the body bones; for TMLI, lymph nodes and spleen were considered into the target, too. Dose prescription to PTV was 12 Gy in six fractions, two times per day for TMI, and 2 Gy in single fraction for TMLI. Ten arcs on five isocenters (two arcs for isocenter) were used to cover the upper part of PTV (i.e., from cranium to middle femurs). For each plan, three series of random shifts with values between -3 and +3 mm and three between -5 and +5 mm were applied to the five isocenters simulating involuntary patient motion during treatment. The shifts were applied separately in the three directions: left-right (L-R), anterior-posterior (A-P), and cranial-caudal (C-C). The worst case scenario with simultaneous random shifts in all directions simultaneously was considered too. Doses were recalculated for the 96 shifted plans (24 for each patient). RESULTS: For all shifts, differences <0.5% were found for mean doses to PTV, body, and organs at risk with volumes >100 cm(3). Maximum doses increased up to 15% for C-C shifted plans. PTV covered by the 95% isodose decreased of 2%-8% revealing target underdosage with the highest values in C-C direction. CONCLUSIONS: The correct isocenter repositioning of TMI-TMLI patients is fundamental, in particular in C-C direction, in order to avoid over- and underdosages especially in the overlap regions. For this reason, a dedicated immobilization system was developed in the authors' center to best immobilize the patient.","['Mancosu, Pietro', 'Navarria, Piera', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Reggiori, Giacomo', 'Sarina, Barbara', 'Tomatis, Stefano', 'Alongi, Filippo', 'Nicolini, Giorgia', 'Fogliata, Antonella', 'Cozzi, Luca', 'Scorsetti, Marta']","['Mancosu P', 'Navarria P', 'Castagna L', 'Reggiori G', 'Sarina B', 'Tomatis S', 'Alongi F', 'Nicolini G', 'Fogliata A', 'Cozzi L', 'Scorsetti M']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Rozzano, Milan 20089, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Equipment Design', 'Femur/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/rehabilitation', 'Lymph Nodes/radiation effects', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Organs at Risk', 'Patient Positioning', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry', 'Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Skull/radiation effects', 'Spleen/radiation effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2014/08/08 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1118/1.4823767 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 2013 Nov;40(11):111713. doi: 10.1118/1.4823767.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Records of 42 eligible female patients treated for MOGCT between 1 May 1995 and 31 December 2010 at two centers were analyzed retrospectively. A telephone questionnaire was performed to gather reproductive and menstrual history. RESULTS: One patient was treated without FSCS and two patients were lost to follow-up. The mean age of the remaining 39 patients was 18.4 +/- 3.2 years. Eighteen of the tumors were histologically pure dysgerminomas (PD) and 21 were non-dysgerminomatous tumors (non-DT). Thirteen patients (33%) presented with stage II-III disease. Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 34 of the 39 patients (87%). Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed in 31 of the 39 patients (79.5%). The frequency of lymph node metastasis was 29% (9/31). Twenty-seven patients (69.2%) received ACT. Disease recurred in six (15.3%) patients, all in the non-DT group. Four of six underwent secondary optimal FSCS followed by chemotherapy. Retroperitoneal nodal recurrence was detected in two of these four patients (50%). Four deaths occurred, three due to chemoresistant aggressive disease and one due to secondary acute myelocytic leukemia. The overall survival rates for patients with PD and non-DT were 100% and 81.4%, respectively. Twenty-three of 27 patients who received ACT continued their regular menses. Sixteen spontaneous pregnancies and one pregnancy by intrauterine insemination were achieved by 21 patients who attempted conception. CONCLUSION: Either primary or secondary FSCS followed by ACT seems to be a feasible and safe approach to preserving future fertility and hormonal function in young patients with MOGCT.","['Ertas, Ibrahim Egemen', 'Taskin, Salih', 'Goklu, Rifat', 'Bilgin, Muzaffer', 'Goc, Goksu', 'Yildirim, Yusuf', 'Ortac, Firat']","['Ertas IE', 'Taskin S', 'Goklu R', 'Bilgin M', 'Goc G', 'Yildirim Y', 'Ortac F']","['Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Tepecik Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20131210,Australia,J Obstet Gynaecol Res,The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,9612761,['Ovarian Germ Cell Cancer'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cryosurgery/*adverse effects', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Fertility Preservation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery', '*Organ Sparing Treatments/adverse effects', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Reoperation/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Turkey', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/11 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2013/12/11 06:00'],"['2013/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jog.12253 [doi]'],ppublish,J Obstet Gynaecol Res. 2014 Mar;40(3):797-805. doi: 10.1111/jog.12253.

Advances in the clinical management of AML patients have been achieved by defining better molecular prognostic markers, but there remains a need for new targeted drugs that disrupt non-overlapping pathways in leukemia cells. The mTOR cellular cascade is critical for cell metabolism, growth, proliferation and survival. Extensive preclinical work suggests that targeting mTOR may provide a powerful approach to block AML precursor cells, while other findings suggest enhanced antileukemic effects by combining mTOR inhibitors with traditional chemotherapy. Such combinations may increase antileukemic responses further, offering unique ways to overcome leukemic cell resistance and to eliminate primitive leukemic precursors.","['Altman, Jessica K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Altman JK', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center & Division of Hematology-Oncology, Lurie 3-107, 303 East Superior Street, Chicago, IL 60611, USA ; Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA ; Department of Medicine, Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Hematol Oncol,International journal of hematologic oncology,101600758,,,,PMC3851308,2013/12/10 06:00,2013/12/10 06:01,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/ijh.13.23 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jun;2(3). doi: 10.2217/ijh.13.23.,,,,,"['P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS530955'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The predictive value of minimal residual disease evaluation as a measurement of in vivo drug resistance opened new perspectives for its use in clinical evaluation to determine a risk-based treatment and as a potential surrogate end point for efficacy. More recently, detailed genomic analyses of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia have increased our knowledge in this disease. It is likely that this will lead to further improvement of risk assessment and stratification to targeted therapies.

In B-cell malignancies, it is increasingly understood that similar pathways are activated through both tonic and chronic active BCR signaling to promote tumor viability and resistance to therapy. Recently, several active and oral agents have emerged that target key proximal kinases in the BCR pathway, including Bruton tyrosine kinase, PI3K, and spleen tyrosine kinase. In early clinical studies, these agents have shown significant activity across a broad range of B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Especially impressive responses have been reported in mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and many patients remain on treatment with continued disease control. Toxicity profiles have been mild in the majority of early studies, without significant myelosuppression over prolonged dosing. Due to these attractive attributes, several agents targeting the BCR pathway are now entering early combination studies with traditional chemotherapeutics and/or other novel agents. It is clear that agents targeting the BCR pathway will significantly affect the design of future therapeutic regimens for B-cell malignancies. Future research will focus on understanding potential mechanisms of resistance, identifying biomarkers of response, and defining optimal combination regimens.","['Fowler, Nathan', 'Davis, Eric']","['Fowler N', 'Davis E']","['1Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In the past decade, there has been an explosion of information on the molecular-genetic features associated with these diseases, fueled recently by the discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation. The development of JAK inhibitors has represented a significant therapeutic advance for these diseases; however, their use in MF has not yet been associated with eradication or a significant suppression of the malignant clone. In this era, much remains to be understood about MF, but it is likely that the identification of key pathogenetic drivers of the disease, coupled with the availability of novel molecularly targeted agents, will result in the discovery of new agents that significantly alter the natural history of the disease. This review focuses on recent and ongoing efforts in the development of novel agents in MF that go beyond the field of JAK inhibitors.","['Odenike, Olatoyosi']",['Odenike O'],"['1Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Results in patients with HIV and lymphoma have now led to studies that will test these principles in HIV patients without concomitant malignancy. In addition, in a patient with HIV and acute myeloid leukemia, the success of an allogeneic transplantation from an unrelated donor carrying a mutation in the CCR5 genes has demonstrated that, in principle, such an approach could also lead to cure of patients with HIV.

Due to their rapid recovery early after allo-HCT and their ability to kill malignant targets without prior exposure, natural killer (NK) cells have been considered one of the main effector cells that mediate early GVL reactions. Conversely, regulatory T ells (Tregs) have proven to be critical in facilitating self-tolerance. Both murine and human studies have demonstrated a significant role for Tregs in the modulation of GVHD after allo-HCT. This article reviews the mechanisms of how these 2 cell types carry out these functions, focusing on the post-allo-HCT period. Surprisingly, relatively few studies have addressed how Tregs and NK cells interact with one another and whether these interactions are antagonistic. Although preclinical studies suggest active cross-talk between NK cells and Tregs, early clinical studies have not shown a detrimental impact of Treg therapy on relapse. Despite this, interruption of tolerogenic signals may enhance the efficacy of NK effector functions. Methods to transiently impair Treg functions and augment NK cell alloreactivity will be discussed.","['Verneris, Michael R']",['Verneris MR'],"[""1Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital, Minneapolis, MN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

We now know that NK cells can be long-lived and remember past exposures. They become educated by interaction with MHC class I molecules to gain potent function to kill targets and produce cytokines. In the clinical setting, haploidentical NK cells can be transferred adoptively to treat cancer. Persistence and in vivo expansion of NK cells depends on lymphodepleting chemotherapy to make space for the release of endogenous IL-15. In vivo expansion is also enhanced by cytokine administration. IL-2 has been used at low doses to stimulate NK cells in vivo, but has the down side of stimulating CD25hi regulatory T cells. IL-15 is now being tested and has the advantage of avoiding inhibitory regulatory T cell stimulation. In refractory acute myeloid leukemia, leukemia clearance is correlated with the persistence and in vivo expansion of NK cells after adoptive transfer. Limitations to NK cell therapy include poor in vivo survival and lack of specificity. Monoclonal antibodies and bispecific or trispecific killer engagers to target CD16 on NK cells to enhance recognition of various tumor antigens and ADAM17 inhibition to prevent CD16 shedding after NK cell activation should promote enhanced killing of cancer with specificity.

Because none of the 3 available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown a clear survival advantage, they all represent reasonable choices. However, in individual patients, the case may be stronger for a particular TKI. In the younger patient, in whom the prospect of eventually achieving treatment-free remission is likely to be of great importance, dasatinib or nilotinib may be preferred, although their advantage over imatinib in this setting remains to be proven. In patients with a higher risk of transformation (which is currently based on prognostic scoring), the more potent TKIs may be preferred because they appear to be more effective at reducing the risk of transformation to BC. However, imatinib still represents an excellent choice for many chronic myeloid leukemia patients. All of these considerations need to be made in the context of the patient's comorbidities, which may lead to one or more TKIs being ruled out of contention. Whatever first choice of TKI is made, treatment failure or intolerance must be recognized early because a prompt switch to another TKI likely provides the best chance of achieving optimal response.","['Hughes, Timothy', 'White, Deborah']","['Hughes T', 'White D']","['1South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, SA Pathology, and University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Because of its improved specificity, immunotherapy potentially offers a way out of this dilemma.

Cytogenetics provide reliable risk stratification for treatment: high hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 are good risk, whereas BCR-ABL1, MLL rearrangements, and hypodiploidy are poor risk. Nevertheless, some patients within the good- and intermediate-risk groups will unpredictably relapse. With advancing technologies in array-based approaches (single nucleotide polymorphism arrays) and next-generation sequencing to study the genome, increasing numbers of new genetic changes are being discovered. These include deletions of B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes, as well as mutations of genes in key signaling pathways. Their associations and interactions with established cytogenetic subgroups and with each other are becoming elucidated. Whether they have a link to outcome is the most important factor for refinement of risk factors in relation to clinical trials. For several newly identified abnormalities, including intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21), that are associated with a poor prognosis with standard therapy, appropriately modified treatment has significantly improved outcome. After the successful use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients with alternative ABL1 translocations and rearrangements involving PDGFRB may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Other aberrations, for example, CRLF2 overexpression and JAK2 mutations, are also providing potential novel therapeutic targets with the prospect of reduced toxicity.","['Harrison, Christine J']",['Harrison CJ'],"['1Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) of older patients may result in long-term survival due to GVL, but the data remain observational and mostly restricted to those 50 to 69 years of age. Patients with excellent performance status and low comorbidity have the best long-term survival after HCT. Novel measures of health status such as self-report or performance-based functional measures allow ""staging the age"" and may inform candidacy for less robust patients. Older matched sibling donors should be preferred over matched unrelated donors (MUDs) because outcomes are equivalent to superior for matched sibling donors compared with MUD. However, MUDs also achieve acceptable outcomes and long-term disease control. An alternative donor can be considered based on institutional protocols and expertise.

Although there has been substantial progress in reducing transplantation-related mortality (TRM), little progress has been made in reducing the risk of disease relapse, which continues to represent the major cause of treatment failure in patients allografted for AML and MDS. Experience with myeloablative conditioning regimens has demonstrated that, although intensification of the preparative regimen reduces relapse risk, any survival benefit is blunted by a concomitant increase in TRM. A similar inverse correlation between relapse risk and TRM is observed in patients allografted using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. However, the markedly lower toxicity of such regimens has permitted the design of novel conditioning strategies aimed at maximizing antitumor activity without excessive transplant toxicity. Coupled with recent advances in drug delivery and design, this has allowed the development of a spectrum of new conditioning regimens in patients with high-risk AML and MDS. At the same time, the optimization of a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect by minimizing posttransplantation immunosuppression, with or without the infusion of donor lymphocytes, is essential if the risk of disease relapse is to be reduced. Recently, the delivery of adjunctive posttransplantation therapies has emerged as a promising method of augmenting antileukemic activity, either through a direct antitumor activity or consequent upon pharmacological manipulation of the alloreactive response. Taken together these advances present a realistic possibility of delivering improved outcome in patients allografted for high-risk AML or MDS.","['Craddock, Charles']",['Craddock C'],"['1Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Its therapeutic effects are to a large extent mediated by GVL effects, but partially offset by treatment-related mortality and loss of quality of life caused by acute and chronic GVHD. Although severe acute and chronic GVHD are associated with a reduction in relapse risk, they are not associated with improved survival. Recent efforts to modulate the GVL-GVH balance include novel methods of in vitro or in vivo T-cell depletion that are associated with a minimal impact on rates of disease recurrence and a dramatically decreased risk for GVHD. Donor selection algorithms may also have a significant impact on transplantation outcomes. Low-expression HLA alleles, particularly HLA-DP, should be incorporated in selection of adult unrelated donors. Evolving data suggest that KIR typing may also be important. High-resolution HLA typing and the importance of fetal-maternal interactions in umbilical cord blood transplantation are also briefly discussed.

Blood samples from 260 stray cats were evaluated, using conventional polymerase chain reaction tests (cPCRs), for the presence of DNA associated with Rickettsia species, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia species. Positive cPCR results occurred in 127/260 subjects (48.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 40.7-58.1), with a prevalence of 31.9% (83/260, 95% CI = 25.4-39.6) for Rickettsia species, 17.7% (46/260, 95% CI= 13.0-23.6) for A phagocytophilum, and 5.4% (14/260, 95% CI = 2.9-9.0) for Ehrlichia species. There was no statistical association between a positive PCR test for vector-borne infections surveyed and colony location, age, gender, body condition score or complete blood count abnormalities, nor feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus or Toxoplasma gondii status.

The tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has recently been shown to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of CML. Nuclear localization and proper nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling are crucial for PTEN's tumor suppressive function. In this study, we show that BCR-ABL enhances HAUSP-induced de-ubiquitination of PTEN in turn favoring its nuclear exclusion. We further demonstrate that BCR-ABL physically interacts with and phosphorylates HAUSP on tyrosine residues to trigger its activity. Importantly, we also find that PTEN delocalization induced by BCR-ABL does not occur in the leukemic stem cell compartment due to high levels of PML, a potent inhibitor of HAUSP activity toward PTEN. We therefore identify a new proto-oncogenic mechanism whereby BCR-ABL antagonizes the nuclear function of the PTEN tumor suppressor, with important therapeutic implications for the eradication of CML minimal residual disease.","['Morotti, A', 'Panuzzo, C', 'Crivellaro, S', 'Pergolizzi, B', 'Familiari, U', 'Berger, A H', 'Saglio, G', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Morotti A', 'Panuzzo C', 'Crivellaro S', 'Pergolizzi B', 'Familiari U', 'Berger AH', 'Saglio G', 'Pandolfi PP']","['1] Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA [2] Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Oncology, San Luigi Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Oncology, San Luigi Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Oncology, San Luigi Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Oncology, St Luigi Hospital, Torino, Italy.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Oncology, San Luigi Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131209,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Ubiquitination']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013370 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.370 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1326-33. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.370.

The role of miRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) development and pathogenesis remains largely unknown. In the present study, we showed that miR-200b was downregulated in clinical prostatic tumors when compared to normal prostate tissue and in advanced PCa cell lines when compared to normal epithelial prostatic cells. Enforced miR-200b expression suppressed PCa cell proliferation and migration and enhanced chemosensitivity to docetaxel by targeting B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1). Bmi-1 was detected at higher levels in PCa, and knockdown of Bmi-1 showed similar effects as miR-200b overexpression in PCa cells. Moreover, we confirmed that these effects were correlated with increased levels of E-cadherin and P16 and a reduction in vimentin expression and expression of stem cell markers (CD44 and OCT4). These findings suggest that miR-200b plays vital roles as a tumor-suppressor by targeting Bmi-1 and may be a promising therapeutic target for PCa treatment.","['Yu, Junjie', 'Lu, Youyi', 'Cui, Di', 'Li, Enhui', 'Zhu, Yipin', 'Zhao, Yuyang', 'Zhao, Fujun', 'Xia, Shujie']","['Yu J', 'Lu Y', 'Cui D', 'Li E', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhao F', 'Xia S']","[""Department of Urology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200080, P.R.

Cox-proportional hazards modeling examined associations between urinary cytokine levels and development of these renal end points. The association of ACR with the hazard of overall mortality was assessed using Cox regression. Increasing urinary IL-6 and IL-15 were associated with an increased risk of developing proteinuria. Urinary MCP-1 during the first 100 days post HCT was associated with kidney disease at 1 year. The degree of albuminuria at any time point in the first 100 days post transplant was related to the subsequent risk of death (for ACR 30-299, hazard ratio (HR)=1.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-2.87; for ACR >300, HR=2.82; 95% CI: 1.60-4.98). After HCT, elevated urinary levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with development of albuminuria and proteinuria, suggesting early intra-renal inflammation as an important pathogenetic mechanism.

It is often associated with autoimmune disorders and immune-mediated cytopenias. Our recent findings suggest that up to 40% of T-LGL patients harbor mutations in the STAT3 gene, whereas STAT5 mutations are present in 2% of patients. In order to identify putative disease-causing genetic alterations in the remaining T-LGL patients, we performed exome sequencing from three STAT mutation-negative patients and validated the findings in 113 large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia patients. On average, 11 CD8+ LGL leukemia cell-specific high-confidence nonsynonymous somatic mutations were discovered in each patient. Interestingly, all patients had at least one mutation that affects either directly the STAT3-pathway (such as PTPRT) or T-cell activation (BCL11B, SLIT2 and NRP1). In all three patients, the STAT3 pathway was activated when studied by RNA expression or pSTAT3 analysis. Screening of the remaining 113 LGL leukemia patients did not reveal additional patients with same mutations. These novel mutations are potentially biologically relevant and represent rare genetic triggers for T-LGL leukemia, and are associated with similar disease phenotype as observed in patients with mutations in the STAT3 gene.","['Andersson, E I', 'Rajala, H L M', 'Eldfors, S', 'Ellonen, P', 'Olson, T', 'Jerez, A', 'Clemente, M J', 'Kallioniemi, O', 'Porkka, K', 'Heckman, C', 'Loughran, T P Jr', 'Maciejewski, J P', 'Mustjoki, S']","['Andersson EI', 'Rajala HL', 'Eldfors S', 'Ellonen P', 'Olson T', 'Jerez A', 'Clemente MJ', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Porkka K', 'Heckman C', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Mustjoki S']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131206,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,PMC3877422,2013/12/10 06:00,2013/12/10 06:01,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201365 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.65 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Dec 6;3:e168. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.65.,,,,,"['K24 HL077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI085578/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacological effect of azacitidine arises after incorporation into the DNA and RNA. To this end, the drug first has to be converted into its triphosphate forms. This paper describes the development of an assay for quantitative determination of azacitidine triphosphate (aza-CTP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To quantify aza-CTP, separation from the endogenous nucleotides cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP) is required. This was a challenge as the structures of these nucleotides are highly similar and the monoisotopic molecular masses of aza-CTP, UTP and the naturally occurring [(13)C]- and [(15)N]-isotopes of CTP differ less than 0.02 Da. Efforts to select a specific MS(2)-fragment for aza-CTP using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer remained without success. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility to separate these highly resembling nucleotides based on accurate mass spectrometry using a linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) coupled with an Orbitrap. The LTQ-Orbitrap was able to differentiate between aza-CTP and the endogenous nucleotides UTP and [(13)C]-CTP. There was no baseline resolution between aza-CTP and [(15)N]-CTP, but the [(15)N]-CTP interference was low. For quantification, extracted ion chromatograms were obtained for the accurate m/z window of the aza-CTP product ion. The assay was able to determine aza-CTP concentrations in PBMC lysate from 40.7 to 281 nM. Assuming that an average cell suspension extracted from 16 mL blood contains 10 to 42 million PBMCs per mL, this range corresponds with 2.58/10.9-17.8/74.9 pmol aza-CTP per million PBMCs. Intra-assay accuracies were between -1.1 and 9.5% deviation and coefficient of variation values were </=13.2%. The assay was successfully applied to quantify aza-CTP in samples from two patients treated with azacitidine. Aza-CTP concentrations up to 19.0 pmol per million PBMCs were measured. This is the first time that aza-CTP concentrations were quantified in PBMCs from patients treated with azacitidine.","['Derissen, Ellen J B', 'Hillebrand, Michel J X', 'Rosing, Hilde', 'Otten, Hans M M B', 'Laille, Eric', 'Schellens, Jan H M', 'Beijnen, Jos H']","['Derissen EJ', 'Hillebrand MJ', 'Rosing H', 'Otten HM', 'Laille E', 'Schellens JH', 'Beijnen JH']","['Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Slotervaart Hospital/The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Louwesweg 6, 1066 EC Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Germline transmission competency of the chimeric rats was not influenced by the profile of ES cell lines until their establishment.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, Ahr ablation in mice and studies with orthologous genes in invertebrates suggest that AHR may also play a significant role in embryonic development. To address this hypothesis, we studied the regulation of Ahr expression in mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny. In ES cells, interactions between OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2 and Polycomb Group proteins at the Ahr promoter repress AHR expression, which can also be repressed by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors in hepatoma cells. In ES cells, unproductive RNA polymerase II binds at the Ahr transcription start site and drives the synthesis of short abortive transcripts. Activation of Ahr expression during differentiation follows from reversal of repressive marks in Ahr promoter chromatin, release of pluripotency factors and PcG proteins, binding of Sp factors, establishment of histone marks of open chromatin, and engagement of active RNAPII to drive full-length RNA transcript elongation.

The system consisted of a 3.5mum particle bonded octadecyl silica column, with gradient elution using a mixture of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile and 10mM ammonium formate in water with 0.1% formic acid. The analyte was quantified using the selected reaction-monitoring mode of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray interface. The assay was validated in a 75-2500ng/mL calibration range. For quality control, within-day and between-day precisions were 1.2-2.8%, and 1.2-6.9%, respectively. The beta-expectation tolerance limit (accuracy) met the limits of acceptance +/-15% (+/-20% for the LLQ). The drug was sufficiently stable under all relevant analytical conditions.

A cardinal feature of HTLV-1 infection is the presence of expanded clones of HTLV-1-infected T cells, which may persist for decades. A high viral burden (proviral load) is associated with both the inflammatory and malignant diseases caused by HTLV-1, and it has been believed that the oligoclonal expansion of infected cells predisposes to these diseases. However, it is not understood what regulates the clonality of HTLV-1 in vivo, that is, the number and abundance of HTLV-1-infected T cell clones.

Here we evaluate the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 17 children and young adults with sMDS/sAML after childhood aplastic anemia. The median interval between the diagnosis of aplastic anemia and the development of sMDS/sAML was 2.9 years (range, 1.2 to 13.0 years). At a median age of 13.1 years (range, 4.4 to 26.7 years), patients underwent HSCT with bone marrow (n = 6) or peripheral blood stem cell (n = 11) grafts from HLA-matched sibling donors (n = 2), mismatched family donors (n = 2), or unrelated donors (n = 13). Monosomy 7 was detected in 13 patients. The preparative regimen consisted of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan in 11 patients and other agents in 6 patients. All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 47%, and that of chronic GVHD was 70%. Relapse occurred in 1 patient. The major cause of death was transplant-related complication (n = 9). Overall survival and event-free survival at 5 years after HSCT were both 41%. In summary, this study indicates that HSCT is a curative therapy for some patients with sMDS/sAML after aplastic anemia.

AML is frequently associated with mutations or chromosomal rearrangements involving transcription factors. PU.1 (encoded by Sfpi1) is an E26 transformation-specific family transcription factor that is required for myeloid differentiation. Reduced PU.1 levels, caused by either mutation or repression, are associated with human AML and are sufficient to cause AML in mice. The objective of this study was to determine whether reduced PU.1 expression induces deregulation of the cell cycle in the myeloid lineage. Our results showed that immature myeloid cells expressing reduced PU.1 levels (Sfpi1(BN/BN) myeloid cells) proliferated indefinitely in cell culture and expanded in vivo. Transplantation of Sfpi1(BN/BN) cells induced AML in recipient mice. Cultured Sfpi1(BN/BN) cells expressed elevated messenger RNA transcript and protein levels of E2F1, an important regulator of cell cycle entry. Restoration of PU.1 expression in Sfpi1(BN/BN) myeloid cells blocked proliferation, induced differentiation, and reduced E2F1 expression. Taken together, these data show that PU.1 controls cell cycle exit in the myeloid lineage associated with downregulation of E2F1 expression.","['Ziliotto, Rachel', 'Gruca, Marek R', 'Podder, Shreya', 'Noel, Greg', 'Ogle, Cora K', 'Hess, David A', 'DeKoter, Rodney P']","['Ziliotto R', 'Gruca MR', 'Podder S', 'Noel G', 'Ogle CK', 'Hess DA', 'DeKoter RP']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Research, Shriners Hospital for Children, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Research, Shriners Hospital for Children, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Surgery, The University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Robarts Research Institute, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Oncology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.

In particular, dual-color, z-scan fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy in conjunction with total internal reflection fluorescence and conventional, epi-illumination imaging were utilized.

These observations imply fundamental differences between HIV-1 and HTLV-1 Gag trafficking and membrane association.","['Fogarty, Keir H', 'Berk, Serkan', 'Grigsby, Iwen F', 'Chen, Yan', 'Mansky, Louis M', 'Mueller, Joachim D']","['Fogarty KH', 'Berk S', 'Grigsby IF', 'Chen Y', 'Mansky LM', 'Mueller JD']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA; Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

Furthermore, cladribine affects the T cell priming capacity of dendritic cells, resulting in reduced induction of interferon-gamma- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-producing T cells and increased induction of interleukin-10-producing T cells.

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of miR-128a, especially that in the Fas-signalling pathway, in T-cell leukaemia cells. The role of miR-128a in Fas-mediated apoptosis was examined by using Fas-activating antibody (CH-11)-susceptible Jurkat cells and -resistant Jurkat/R cells. Whereas ectopic expression of miR-128a conferred Fas-resistance on Jurkat cells by directly targeting Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), antagonizing miR-128a expression sensitized Jurkat/R cells to the Fas-mediated apoptosis through derepression of FADD expression. Myeloid leukaemia HL60 and K562 cells were also CH-11-resistant, sharing a similar resistant mechanism with Jurkat/R cells. Furthermore, CH-11 induced demethylation of the promoter region of miR-128a with resultant up-regulation of miR-128a expression in Jurkat/R cells, which was shown to be a mechanism for the resistance ofJurkat/R cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicate that the induction of miR-128a expression by DNA demethylation is a novel mechanism of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis.","['Yamada, Nami', 'Noguchi, Shunsuke', 'Kumazaki, Minami', 'Shinohara, Haruka', 'Miki, Kohei', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Yamada N', 'Noguchi S', 'Kumazaki M', 'Shinohara H', 'Miki K', 'Naoe T', 'Akao Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (MIRN128 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00414-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.11.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014 Mar;1843(3):590-602. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.11.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated diagnostic criteria and factors that might affect its development and outcome. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, we analyzed medical records and intestinal specimens from 10 patients diagnosed with intestinal CD4+ T-cell lymphoma among 115 consecutive patients examined for severe enteropathy with villous atrophy. Samples were analyzed by histology, flow cytometry, and comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: Small-intestine epithelial and lamina propria tissues from patients who presented with chronic diarrhea and malnutrition had variable levels of infiltration of CD3+ CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry showed a high frequency of CD4+ intraepithelial cells, which frequently expressed a specific Vbeta chain. T-cell receptor beta clonality was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two patients had HLA and serology results compatible with celiac disease and autoimmune enteropathy, respectively. Two patients were found to have antibodies against human T-cell leukemia virus and 2 patients had signs of a recent infection with the herpes viruses. Comparative genomic hybridization analyses showed heterogeneous chromosomal abnormalities. Symptoms were reduced in patients treated with steroids (n = 5), but not in patients given purine analogues or chemotherapy. Antibodies against CD52 produced clinical and histologic responses in 2 of 2 patients, whereas severe adverse effects developed in 1 patient. At the latest follow-up evaluation, all patients were alive. CONCLUSIONS: There is much heterogeneity in the onset and genetic features of intestinal CD4+ T-cell lymphomas, despite their common presentation as indolent lymphoproliferations of the intestinal mucosa. Patients should be treated with steroids, and possibly antibodies against CD52 (for the most aggressive forms of this disorder).","['Malamut, Georgia', 'Meresse, Bertrand', 'Kaltenbach, Sophie', 'Derrieux, Coralie', 'Verkarre, Virginie', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Ruskone-Fourmestraux, Agnes', 'Fabiani, Bettina', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Brousse, Nicole', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Cerf-Bensussan, Nadine', 'Cellier, Christophe']","['Malamut G', 'Meresse B', 'Kaltenbach S', 'Derrieux C', 'Verkarre V', 'Macintyre E', 'Ruskone-Fourmestraux A', 'Fabiani B', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Brousse N', 'Hermine O', 'Cerf-Bensussan N', 'Cellier C']","['Universite Paris Descartes-Sorbonne Paris Centre, Paris, France; Gastroenterology Department, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France; Inserm U989, Paris, France; Institute Imagine, Paris, France.

A LAA/HA1-peptide/protein stimulation, cloning and monitoring strategy for specific CD8(+)/CD4(+)T-cells in AML-pts after SCT is given. Our results show that (1) LAA-peptide-specific CD8+T-cells are detectable in every AML-pt after SCT. CD8(+)T-cells, recognizing two different antigens detectable in 5 of 7 cases correlate with long-lasting remissions. Clonal TCR-Vbeta-restriction exemplarily proven by spectratyping in PRAME-specific CD8(+)T-cells; high PRAME-peptide-reactivity was CD4(+)-associated, as shown by IFN-gamma-release. (2) Two types of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were tested for presentation of LAA/HA1-proteins to CD4(+)T-cells: miniEBV-transduced lymphoblastoid cells (B-cell-source) and CD4-depleted MNC (source for B-cell/monocyte/DC). We provide a refined cloning-system for proliferating, CD40L(+)CD4(+)T-cells after LAA/HA1-stimulation. CD4(+)T-cells produced cytokines (GM-CSF, IFN-gamma) upon exposure to LAA/HA1-stimulation until after at least 7 restimulations and demonstrated cytotoxic activity against naive blasts, but not fibroblasts.

Despite sharing the common property of pluripotency, hESCs are notably distinct from epiblast cells of the preimplantation blastocyst. Here we use a combination of three small-molecule inhibitors to sustain hESCs in a LIF signaling-dependent hESC state (3iL hESCs) with elevated expression of NANOG and epiblast-enriched genes such as KLF4, DPPA3, and TBX3. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis confirms that the expression signature of 3iL hESCs shares similarities with native preimplantation epiblast cells. We also show that 3iL hESCs have a distinct epigenetic landscape, characterized by derepression of preimplantation epiblast genes. Using genome-wide binding profiles of NANOG and OCT4, we identify enhancers that contribute to rewiring of the regulatory circuitry. In summary, our study identifies a distinct hESC state with defined regulatory circuitry that will facilitate future analysis of human preimplantation embryogenesis and pluripotency.","['Chan, Yun-Shen', 'Goke, Jonathan', 'Ng, Jia-Hui', 'Lu, Xinyi', 'Gonzales, Kevin Andrew Uy', 'Tan, Cheng-Peow', 'Tng, Wei-Quan', 'Hong, Zhong-Zhi', 'Lim, Yee-Siang', 'Ng, Huck-Hui']","['Chan YS', 'Goke J', 'Ng JH', 'Lu X', 'Gonzales KA', 'Tan CP', 'Tng WQ', 'Hong ZZ', 'Lim YS', 'Ng HH']","['Gene Regulation Laboratory, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore.

Recently, a RET (exon 12) rearrangement with FGFR1OP [fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) oncogene partner] (exon 12) was identified in one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patient. We report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel FGFR1OP (exon 11)-RET (exon 11) gene fusion event (named FGFR1OP-RET), mediated by a reciprocal translocation t(6; 10)(q27; q11), in a patient affected by primary myelofibrosis (PMF) with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The FGFR1OP-RET fusion protein displayed constitutive tyrosine kinase and transforming activity in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and induced IL3-independent growth and activation of PI3K/STAT signaling in hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells. FGFR1OP-RET supported cytokine-independent growth, protection from stress and enhanced self-renewal of primary murine hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells in vitro. In vivo, FGFR1OP-RET caused a spectrum of disease phenotypes, with >50% of mice showing a fatal myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). Other phenotypes were leukemia transplantable in secondary recipients, dramatic expansion of the mast cell lineage, and reduction of repopulating activity upon lethal irradiation. In conclusion, FGFR1OP-RET chimeric oncogenes are endowed with leukemogenic potential and associated to myeloid neoplasms (CMML and PMF/AML).","['Bossi, Daniela', 'Carlomagno, Francesca', 'Pallavicini, Isabella', 'Pruneri, Giancarlo', 'Trubia, Maurizio', 'Raviele, Paola Rafaniello', 'Marinelli, Alessandra', 'Anaganti, Suresh', 'Cox, Maria Christina', 'Viale, Giuseppe', 'Santoro, Massimo', 'Di Fiore, Pier Paolo', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Bossi D', 'Carlomagno F', 'Pallavicini I', 'Pruneri G', 'Trubia M', 'Raviele PR', 'Marinelli A', 'Anaganti S', 'Cox MC', 'Viale G', 'Santoro M', 'Di Fiore PP', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Cellular and Molecular Pathology, University Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Cellular and Molecular Pathology, University Federico II, Naples, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology, A.O.

In our experience, only 1/3 patients have a matched unrelated donor (MUD); therefore, the majority of the patients will require umbilical cord blood (UCB). Patients treated for hematologic diseases with UCB transplants were included. UCB selection and conditioning regimens were performed according to the Minnesota group. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, infection prevention, and patient care were performed according to institutional guidelines. We analyzed patients and graft demography, neutrophil and platelet recovery, chimerism kinetics, GVHD incidence, overall (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and transplant-related mortality (TRM). We included 29 patients with a median age of 34.8 years (range 15-55). Eighteen were male and the median weight was 72.6 kg (range 54-100). Nineteen patients had acute leukemia. Myeloablative (MA) conditioning was used in 27 patients. Seventeen received double UCB (DUCB) grafts. Median total nucleated cell (10(7)/kg) was 4.2 (range 3.9-4.9) and 4.4 (range 2.8-6.3) for single UCB (SUCB) and DUCB transplants, respectively. Median time for neutrophil engraftment was 24.7 (range 14-43) and 25.8 days (range 14-52) after SUCB and DUCB transplants, respectively. Median time for platelet engraftment was 147 (range 30-516) and 81 days (range 37-200) after SUCB and DUCB transplants, respectively. All the patients receiving MA conditioning had >95% chimerism shortly after transplant. Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD was 41% and 20%, respectively. Localized chronic GVHD was seen in 14% of the patients. Median follow-up was 16.7 months (range 1-63). Five-year OS and PFS were 38% and 39%, respectively. One-year TRM was 42%. UCB transplantation is associated with potential cure of hematologic malignancies and our results are similar to other series.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the clinical and histopathological features of cutaneous LBL. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the clinical and histologic features of 13 patients with cutaneous LBL, 6 with B-LBL and 7 with T-LBL. RESULTS: Five of 6 patients with B-LBL had lesions in the head and neck area, whereas 4 of 7 patients with T-LBL developed skin lesions on sites other than the head and neck. Seven patients (1 case of B-LBL, and 6 of 7 cases of T-LBL) developed multiple skin lesions, and the T-LBL cases frequently developed multiple skin lesions in the head, neck, and throughout the torso. Complete remission was achieved in 9 patients (3 patients with T-LBL and all patients with B-LBL). LIMITATIONS: This study used a retrospective design and included a small sample size. CONCLUSION: This study compared the clinical features of T-LBL and B-LBL, in particular the affected sites and number of skin lesions. Cutaneous T-LBL is likely to be accompanied by disseminated disease and has a relatively poor prognosis compared with B-LBL.","['Lee, Woo Jin', 'Moon, Hye Rim', 'Won, Chong Hyun', 'Chang, Sung Eun', 'Choi, Jee Ho', 'Moon, Kee Chan', 'Lee, Mi Woo']","['Lee WJ', 'Moon HR', 'Won CH', 'Chang SE', 'Choi JH', 'Moon KC', 'Lee MW']","['Department of Dermatology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

These results exemplify the effectiveness of HRM-based approaches for hypermutation quantification and for the detection of hypermutated DNA sequences potentially associated with disease or retroviral drug resistance.","['Belanger, Kasandra', 'Savoie, Mathieu', 'Aydin, Halil', 'Renner, Tyler Milston', 'Montazeri, Zahra', 'Langlois, Marc-Andre']","['Belanger K', 'Savoie M', 'Aydin H', 'Renner TM', 'Montazeri Z', 'Langlois MA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131025,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/instrumentation/*methods', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Deamination', '*Genome, Viral', 'HIV Infections/*enzymology/virology', 'HIV-1/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Point Mutation', 'Retroviridae Infections/*enzymology/virology']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(13)00568-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2013.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2014 Jan 5;448:168-75. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2013.10.008.

Despite the presence of phase III trials to support clinical decision-making, we hypothesized that physicians who treat adult ALL would demonstrate wide practice variation. Canadian hematologists who treat ALL were surveyed electronically. Overall, 69 of 173 physicians responded (40%). There was high agreement with offering alloHCT for ALL with high-risk cytogenetics or induction failure after a single chemotherapy cycle. However, only a minority of respondents felt that age >35 years was an indication for alloHCT in CR1. Almost all respondents (96%) felt that a well-matched unrelated donor was an acceptable alternative to a sibling donor. There was uncertainty about the role of cord blood (53% agree) and the utility of reduced intensity conditioning HCT (41% agree). In contrast to the results of the MRC/ECOG study, respondents considered alloHCT to be particularly helpful in high-risk patients. Consensus was lacking on the use of cord blood, RIC alloHCT, and the application of MRD. Equipoise exists on the role of alloHCT in CR1 in ALL, suggesting that further trials in this area are required.","['Paulson, K', 'Szwajcer, D', 'Raymond, C B', 'Seftel, M D']","['Paulson K', 'Szwajcer D', 'Raymond CB', 'Seftel MD']","['Section of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.

24314616,NLM,MEDLINE,20140226,20140818,1474-5488 (Electronic) 1470-2045 (Linking),15,1,2014 Jan,Childhood cancer survival in Europe 1999-2007: results of EUROCARE-5--a population-based study.,35-47,10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70548-5 [doi] S1470-2045(13)70548-5 [pii],"BACKGROUND: Survival and cure rates for childhood cancers in Europe have greatly improved over the past 40 years and are mostly good, although not in all European countries. The EUROCARE-5 survival study estimates survival of children diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2007, assesses whether survival differences among European countries have changed, and investigates changes from 1999 to 2007. METHODS: We analysed survival data for 157,499 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed between Jan 1, 1978 and Dec 31, 2007. They came from 74 population-based cancer registries in 29 countries. We calculated observed, country-weighted 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival for major cancers and all cancers combined. For comparison between countries, we used the corrected group prognosis method to provide survival probabilities adjusted for multiple confounders (sex, age, period of diagnosis, and, for all cancers combined without CNS cancers, casemix). Age-adjusted survival differences by area and calendar period were calculated with period analysis and were given for all cancers combined and the major cancers. FINDINGS: We analysed 59,579 cases. For all cancers combined for children diagnosed in 2000-07, 1-year survival was 90.6% (95% CI 90.2-90.9), 3-year survival was 81.0 % (95% CI 80.5-81.4), and 5-year survival was 77.9% (95% CI 77.4-78.3). For all cancers combined, 5-year survival rose from 76.1% (74.4-77.7) for 1999-2001, to 79.1% (77.3-80.7) for 2005-07 (hazard ratio 0.973, 95% CI 0.965-0.982, p<0.0001). The greatest improvements were in eastern Europe, where 5-year survival rose from 65.2% (95% CI 63.1-67.3) in 1999-2001, to 70.2% (67.9-72.3) in 2005-07. Europe-wide average yearly change in mortality (hazard ratio) was 0.939 (95% CI 0.919-0.960) for acute lymphoid leukaemia, 0.959 (0.933-0.986) for acute myeloid leukaemia, and 0.940 (0.897-0.984) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality for all of Europe did not change significantly for Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, CNS tumours, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Disparities for 5-year survival persisted between countries and regions, ranging from 70% to 82% (for 2005-07). INTERPRETATION: Several reasons might explain persisting inequalities. The lack of health-care resources is probably most important, especially in some eastern European countries with limited drug supply, lack of specialised centres with multidisciplinary teams, delayed diagnosis and treatment, poor management of treatment, and drug toxicity. In the short term, cross-border care and collaborative programmes could help to narrow the survival gaps in Europe.

Although cost effective compared to whole genome sequencing, analysis of many samples constitutes a significant cost, which could be reduced by pooling samples before capture. Another limitation to the number of cancer samples that can be analyzed is often the amount of available tumor DNA. We evaluated the performance of whole genome amplified DNA and the power to detect subclonal somatic single nucleotide variants in non-indexed pools of cancer samples using the HaloPlex technology for target enrichment and next generation sequencing. RESULTS: We captured a set of 1528 putative somatic single nucleotide variants and germline SNPs, which were identified by whole genome sequencing, with the HaloPlex technology and sequenced to a depth of 792-1752. We found that the allele fractions of the analyzed variants are well preserved during whole genome amplification and that capture specificity or variant calling is not affected. We detected a large majority of the known single nucleotide variants present uniquely in one sample with allele fractions as low as 0.1 in non-indexed pools of up to ten samples. We also identified and experimentally validated six novel variants in the samples included in the pools. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates that whole genome amplified DNA can be used for target enrichment equally well as genomic DNA and that accurate variant detection is possible in non-indexed pools of cancer samples. These findings show that analysis of a large number of samples is feasible at low cost, even when only small amounts of DNA is available, and thereby significantly increases the chances of indentifying recurrent mutations in cancer samples.","['Berglund, Eva C', 'Lindqvist, Carl Marten', 'Hayat, Shahina', 'Overnas, Elin', 'Henriksson, Niklas', 'Nordlund, Jessica', 'Wahlberg, Per', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine']","['Berglund EC', 'Lindqvist CM', 'Hayat S', 'Overnas E', 'Henriksson N', 'Nordlund J', 'Wahlberg P', 'Forestier E', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Syvanen AC']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. eva.berglund@medsci.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells/metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC4046713,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-14-856 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-14-856 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2013 Dec 5;14:856. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-14-856.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Stat3 activity in ESCC cells was inhibited with JAK/Stat3 inhibitors (AG490 or JSI-124). Specific siRNA was used to inhibit the Stat3 expression. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Expression of Mcl-1 protein was determined by Western blotting. Expression of phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) and myeloid leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) proteins in ESCC tissues was detected by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. The relationship between p-Stat3 or Mcl-1 aberrant expression and clinicopatholohical features of ESCC was analyzed. The correlation of their expression was also analyzed. RESULTS: Suppression of the Stat3 signaling activation in ESCC cells led to marked apoptosis, and dramatic reduction of Mcl-1 protein. The positive rate of phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) expression was 45.0% in 50/111 of the ESCC tissue samples. The lower the degree of tumor differentiation, the higher the positive rate of phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705), showing a significant difference (P = 0.018). The positive rate of Mcl-1 protein expression was 72.1% (80/111), and the lower the degree of tumor differentiation was, the higher there was the positive rate of Mcl-1, with a significant difference (P = 0.026). There was a positive correlation between the expressions of p-Stat3 and Mcl-1 proteins (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In a subset of ESCC tissues, p-Stat3 (Tyr705) and Mcl-1 are overexpressed and positively correlated with each other, and both are correlated with tumor differentiation. Persistent activation of Stat3 contributes to apoptotic resistance in ESCC cells, and may be at least partly mediated through upregulation of Mcl-1.","['Huo, Yan-qiu', 'Ruan, Xia', 'DU, Xiao-li', 'Shang, Li', 'Cai, Yan', 'Xu, Xin', 'Wang, Ming-rong', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Fu, Song-bin']","['Huo YQ', 'Ruan X', 'DU XL', 'Shang L', 'Cai Y', 'Xu X', 'Wang MR', 'Zhang Y', 'Fu SB']","['Medical Genetics Laboratory, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2013 Aug;35(8):579-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A life-time Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of azacitidine compared with conventional care regimens. The health states modelled were: myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and death. Variables measured included survival rates, progression probabilities and quality of life indicators. Resource use and cost data reflect the Spanish context. The analysis was performed from the Spanish National Health System perspective, discounting both costs (in 2012 euros) and future effects at 3%. The time horizon considered was end-of-life. Results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained and cost per life-year gained and compared with cost-effectiveness thresholds. RESULTS: According to the current use of each conventional care regimens options in Spain, azacitidine resulted in euro34,673 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (euro28,891 per life-year gained) with an increase of 1.89 in quality-adjusted life-years (2.26 in life-years). Azacitidine was superior to best supportive care and low dose chemotherapy in terms of quality-adjusted life-years gained, 1.82 and 2.03, respectively (life-years 2.16 vs. best supportive care, 2.39 vs. low dose chemotherapy). Treatment with azacitidine resulted in longer survival time and thus longer treatment time and lifetime costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro39,610 per quality-adjusted life-year gained vs. best supportive care and euro30,531 per quality-adjusted life-year gained vs. low dose chemotherapy (euro33,111 per life-year gained vs. best supportive care and euro25,953 per life-year gained vs. low dose chemotherapy). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed that the use of azacitidine in the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome is a cost-effective option compared with conventional care regimen options used in the Spanish setting and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio within the range of the thresholds accepted by health authorities.","['Crespo, Carlos', 'Moreno, Estela', 'Sierra, Jordi', 'Serip, Suzan', 'Rubio, Marta']","['Crespo C', 'Moreno E', 'Sierra J', 'Serip S', 'Rubio M']","['Statistic Department, University of Barcelona, C/Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08028, Spain. carlos.crespo@oblikue.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131205,Germany,Health Econ Rev,Health economics review,101583209,,,,PMC4029489,2013/12/10 06:00,2013/12/10 06:01,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/10 06:01 [medline]']","['2191-1991-3-28 [pii]', '10.1186/2191-1991-3-28 [doi]']",epublish,Health Econ Rev. 2013 Dec 5;3(1):28. doi: 10.1186/2191-1991-3-28.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism related to a favorable prognosis in AML1-ETO-positive AML is still not fully understood. Our results show that the AML1-ETO fusion protein triggered activation of early growth response gene l (EGR1) by binding at AML1-binding sites on the EGR1 promoter and, subsequently, recruiting acetyltransferase P300, which is known to acetylate histones. However, AML1-ETO could not recruit DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases; therefore, EGR1 expression was affected by histone acetylation but not by DNA methylation. Both transcription and translation of EGR1 were higher in AML1-ETO-positive AML cell lines than in AML1-ETO-negative AML cell lines, owing to acetylation. Furthermore, when AML1-ETO-positive AML cell lines were treated with C646 (P300 inhibitor) and trichostatin A (histone deacetylase inhibitor), EGR1 expression was significantly decreased and increased, respectively. In addition, treatment with 5-azacytidine (methyltransferase inhibitor) did not cause any significant change in EGR1 expression. Overexpression of EGR1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, and EGR1 knockout promoted cell proliferation. Thus, EGR1 could be a novel prognostic factor for a favorable outcome in AML1-ETO-positive AML.

Vacuum cleaner samples were collected from 289 homes in the California Childhood Leukemia Study during two sampling rounds from 2001 to 2010 and 15 PCBs were measured by high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Median concentrations of the most abundant PCBs (i.e., PCBs 28, 52, 101, 105, 118, 138, 153, and 180) ranged from 1.0-5.8 ng per g of dust in the first sampling round and from 0.8-3.4 ng/g in the second sampling round. For each of these eight PCBs, we used a random-effects model to apportion total variation into regional variability (6-11%), intraregional between-home variability (27-56%), within-home variability over time (18-52%), and within-sample variability (9-16%). In mixed-effects models, differences in PCB concentrations between homes were explained by home age, with older homes having higher PCB levels. Differences in PCB concentrations within homes were explained by decreasing time trends. Estimated half-lives ranged from 5-18 years, indicating that PCBs are removed very slowly from the indoor environment. Our findings suggest that it may be feasible to use residential dust for retrospective assessment of PCB exposures in studies of children's health.","['Whitehead, Todd P', 'Brown, F Reber', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Park, June-Soo', 'Does, Monique', 'Dhaliwal, Joginder', 'Petreas, Myrto X', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Rappaport, Stephen M']","['Whitehead TP', 'Brown FR', 'Metayer C', 'Park JS', 'Does M', 'Dhaliwal J', 'Petreas MX', 'Buffler PA', 'Rappaport SM']","['University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, 50 University Hall MC 7360, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20131216,United States,Environ Sci Technol,Environmental science & technology,0213155,"['0 (Dust)', 'DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dust/*analysis', 'Environmental Exposure/analysis', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Half-Life', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC3941978,2013/12/10 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/es403863m [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Sci Technol. 2014;48(1):157-64. doi: 10.1021/es403863m.

In the present work, we wished to investigate whether D393-CD20 variant was expressed by B cells from patients with pemphigus. Ten patients with bullous pemphigoid and twenty-five patients with pemphigus were included. All patients were responder to conventional immunosuppressive agents or rituximab (n = 11). Efficacy of B-cell activation by pokeweed mitogen was assessed by CD86 expression using a FACS Canto II flow cytometer. mRNA CD20 expression study was then performed using RT-PCR assay allowing first to discriminate wild-type (wt)-CD20 and D393-CD20 transcript. Although wt-CD20 expression was always detected, we were unable to detect D393-CD20, even after B-cell activation or RTX treatment. Our results suggest that D393-CD20 transcript may be a molecular marker of B-cell malignancies rather than autoimmune disease like pemphigus. Further study of RTX non-responders or non-escaping PV patients is thus still required to appreciate whether D393-CD20 expression may be detected under the pressure of RTX therapy.","['Gamonet, Clementine', 'Ferrand, Christophe', 'Colliou, Natacha', 'Musette, Philippe', 'Joly, Pascal', 'Girardin, Marie', 'Humbert, Philippe', 'Aubin, Francois']","['Gamonet C', 'Ferrand C', 'Colliou N', 'Musette P', 'Joly P', 'Girardin M', 'Humbert P', 'Aubin F']","['Inserm UMR 1098, Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne-Franche Comte, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pemphigus/*genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rituximab']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/08/26 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/exd.12299 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2014 Jan;23(1):66-7. doi: 10.1111/exd.12299.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD20', 'pemphigus', 'rituximab']",,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), previously known as juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML), is a rare, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease typically presenting in early childhood. CASE REPORTS: Two cases are described of immunodeficiency disorders, both treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (Busulfan plus cyclophosphamide) before bone marrow transplantation. After treatment, these two different cases showed several similar oral lesions: microdontia, root alterations, numerous tooth ageneses, incomplete calcification, enamel hypoplasia, premature apexification and hypodontia. Both subjects underwent dental and orthodontic treatment. The first phase comprised orthopaedic treatment using a removable appliance (Interim-G(R)) followed by rapid palatal expansion; in the second phase patients underwent tooth extraction and were treated using fixed appliances for 19 and 26 months, respectively (mean 2 years) to obtain final alignment and maximum intercuspation. In the third and final phase, reconstruction of malformed teeth was completed, and implant-supported protheses were applied. CONCLUSION: The difficulties of managing and treating these diseases are discussed, with particular focus on tooth anomalies and malocclusion disorders. Collaboration between dentist and paediatrician in dealing with patients with a variety of oral lesions and tooth anomalies is important in order to prevent any other possible tooth lesions and ensure correct jaw development.","['Cossellu, G', 'Seramondi, R', 'Benedicenti, S', 'Farronato, G', 'Olivi, G', 'Angiero, F']","['Cossellu G', 'Seramondi R', 'Benedicenti S', 'Farronato G', 'Olivi G', 'Angiero F']","['Department of Orthodontics, University of Milan, Orthodontic Department, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Eur J Paediatr Dent,European journal of paediatric dentistry,101121881,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Busulfan/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Malocclusion/etiology', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*complications/therapy', 'Tooth Abnormalities/*etiology']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur J Paediatr Dent. 2013 Dec;14(4):328-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label study to investigate the efficacy of deferasirox (DFX) by serial measurement of serum ferritin (S-ferritin) level, liver iron concentration (LIC) level using relaxation rates magnetic resonance imaging, and other laboratory variables in patients with MDS or AA. RESULTS: A total of 96 patients showing S-ferritin level of at least 1000 ng/mL received daily DFX for up to 1 year. At the end of the study, S-ferritin level was significantly decreased in MDS (p=0.02366) and AA (p=0.0009). LIC level was also significantly reduced by more than 6.7 mg Fe/g dry weight from baseline. Hemoglobin level and platelet counts were significantly increased from baseline (p=0.002 and p=0.025, respectively) for patients showing significant anemia or thrombocytopenia. Elevated alanine aminotransferase was also significantly decreased from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that DFX is effective in reducing S-ferritin and LIC level in transfusional iron overload patients with MDS or AA and is well tolerated. In addition, positive effects in hematologic and hepatic function can be expected with DFX. Iron chelation treatment should be considered in transfused patients with MDS and AA when transfusion-related iron overload is documented.","['Cheong, June-Won', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Lee, Jae Hoon', 'Park, Hee-Sook', 'Kim, Ho Young', 'Shim, Hyeok', 'Seong, Chu-Myung', 'Kim, Chul Soo', 'Chung, Jooseop', 'Hyun, Myung Soo', 'Jo, Deog-Yeon', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Yoon, Hwi-Joong', 'Kim, Byung Soo', 'Joo, Young-Don', 'Park, Chi-Young', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Cheong JW', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee KH', 'Yoon SS', 'Lee JH', 'Park HS', 'Kim HY', 'Shim H', 'Seong CM', 'Kim CS', 'Chung J', 'Hyun MS', 'Jo DY', 'Jung CW', 'Sohn SK', 'Yoon HJ', 'Kim BS', 'Joo YD', 'Park CY', 'Min YH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20131203,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Triazoles)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*therapy', 'Benzoates/*therapeutic use', 'Deferasirox', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Overload/*drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.12507 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2014 Jun;54(6):1542-51. doi: 10.1111/trf.12507.

Therapeutic options for AML that are relapsed or refractory to front-line chemotherapy are limited, and the development of effective agents for this indication is an unmet need. The aminopeptidase-inhibitor tosedostat (CHR-2797) is a novel metalloenzyme inhibitor that blocks a critical step in the protein degradation and re-synthesizes intracellular pathway. This orally bioavailable agent has shown promising activity in vitro and in early clinical trials for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the development of tosedostat to date. Specifically, the authors review the literature on its mechanism of action, pharmacoepidemiology and the currently available preclinical and clinical data. EXPERT OPINION: Tosedostat is an oral agent with a novel mechanism of action. Early trials of tosedostat in relapsed/refractory elderly AML have shown encouraging results in a population with an overall very poor prognosis. This is particularly noted in patients with a prior history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and hypomethylating-agent (HMA) use. Additional studies of tosedostat in rationally designed combinations with cytarabine and HMAs in advanced MDS and refractory AML populations are ongoing. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy evaluation is similarly ongoing, and patient selection will be an important consideration in the continued development of this promising compound.","['DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['DiNardo CD', 'Cortes JE']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia , 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0428, Houston, TX 77030 , USA +1 713 794 5783 ; +1 713 745 4612 ; jcortes@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131209,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', 'KZK563J2UW (tosedostat)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glycine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/08/22 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2014.864276 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2014 Feb;23(2):265-72. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2014.864276.

Furthermore, we studied the impact of baseline clinical factors and conditioning regimens on CRP levels in the same period. We conducted a population-based retrospective study of 349 patients undergoing SCT at the National Danish SCT centre between January 2000 and January 2009. CRP levels increased significantly during the conditioning and peaked at day -3 before infusion of the graft. Elevated CRP was associated with older age, non-malignant disease, reduced pretransplant Karnofsky score and high-risk leukaemia. By univariate and multivariate analyses, increased CRP levels (>10 mg/l) before the start of treatment (day -7) and at the day of graft infusion (day 0) were associated with decreased overall survival [HR 1.35 (95%CL) (1.18-1.54); P < 0.0001] and increased treatment-related mortality [1.5 (1.24-1.82); P < 0.0001]. Similar findings were seen for mean CRP levels during the conditioning. CRP was not associated with risk of relapse or aGvHD in multivariate analysis. This study suggests that increased CRP levels before and during the conditioning are associated with baseline clinical factors and that elevated pretransplant CRP levels predict a poorer survival in SCT.","['Jordan, K K I', 'Christensen, I J', 'Heilmann, C', 'Sengelov, H', 'Muller, K G']","['Jordan KK', 'Christensen IJ', 'Heilmann C', 'Sengelov H', 'Muller KG']","['Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine 4072 and Institute for Inflammation Research 7541, National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12137 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2014 Mar;79(3):206-13. doi: 10.1111/sji.12137.,,,,,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging research suggests that ethanol can impair mammalian development by interfering with the execution of molecular programs governing differentiation. For example, ethanol exposure disrupts cellular migration, changes cell-cell interactions, and alters growth factor signaling pathways. Additionally, ethanol can alter epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression. Normally, lineage-specific regulatory factors (i.e., transcription factors) establish the transcriptional networks of each new cell type; the cell's identity then is maintained through epigenetic alterations in the way in which the DNA encoding each gene becomes packaged within the chromatin. Ethanol exposure can induce epigenetic changes that do not induce genetic mutations but nonetheless alter the course of fetal development and result in a large array of patterning defects. Two crucial enzyme complexes--the Polycomb and Trithorax proteins--are central to the epigenetic programs controlling the intricate balance between self-renewal and the execution of cellular differentiation, with diametrically opposed functions. Prenatal ethanol exposure may disrupt the functions of these two enzyme complexes, altering a crucial aspect of mammalian differentiation. Characterizing the involvement of Polycomb and Trithorax group complexes in the etiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders will undoubtedly enhance understanding of the role that epigenetic programming plays in this complex disorder.","['Veazey, Kylee J', 'Muller, Daria', 'Golding, Michael C']","['Veazey KJ', 'Muller D', 'Golding MC']","['Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Alcohol Res,Alcohol research : current reviews,101594475,"['0 (Central Nervous System Depressants)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Central Nervous System Depressants/*adverse effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Ethanol/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multiprotein Complexes/physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3860417,2013/12/10 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/12/10 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Alcohol Res. 2013;35(1):77-85.,,,,,"['1-R03-AA-020129/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', '1-R24-RR-032683/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5-R01-HD-058969/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro cytotoxic activities of a standardized crude methanol extracts prepared from Salvia officinalis L., on a non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma (Raji) and human leukemic monocyte lymphoma (U937), Human acute myelocytic leukemia (KG-1A) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial (HUVEC) cell lines. METHODS: The effect of methanolic extract on the inhibition of cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity was evaluated by Dye exclusion and Micro culture tetrazolium test (MTT) cytotoxicity assay. Cell death ELISA was employed to quantify the nucleosome production result from nuclear DNA fragmentation during apoptosis and determined whether the mechanism involves induction of apoptosis or necrosis. RESULTS: The present results demonstrated that methanolic extract at 50 to 800 mug/ml dose and time-dependently suppressed the proliferation of KG-1A, U937 and Raji cells by more than 80% (p<0.01), with ascending order of IC50 values in 24: KG-1A (214.377 mug/ml), U937 (229.312 mug/ml) and Raji (239.692 mug/ml) when compared with a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug, paclitaxel (Toxol), confirming the tumour-selective cytotoxicity. The crude extract however did not exert any significant cytotoxic effect on normal cell line HUVEC (IC50>800 Ag/ml). Nucleosome productions in KG-1A, Raji and U937 cells were significantly increased respectively upon the treatment of Salvia officinalis L. extract.

These findings suggest that LGP1 treatment may inhibit diabetic nephropathy progression and may regulate several pharmacological targets for treating or preventing diabetic nephropathy.","['Wen, Qingwei', 'Liang, Tao', 'Qin, Feizhang', 'Wei, Jinbin', 'He, Qiaoling', 'Luo, Xiu', 'Chen, Xiaoyu', 'Zheng, Ni', 'Huang, Renbin']","['Wen Q', 'Liang T', 'Qin F', 'Wei J', 'He Q', 'Luo X', 'Chen X', 'Zheng N', 'Huang R']","['Pharmaceutical College, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20131203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anisoles)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (lyoniresinol-3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anisoles/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Fasting', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hypoglycemia/*metabolism', 'Insulin/blood', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney/*drug effects/*injuries/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Streptozocin/*adverse effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3849267,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/09/28 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081772 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-26873 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 3;8(12):e81772. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081772. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the functional consequences of ZAP-70 ectopic expression in malignant B-cells in a xenograft mouse model of disseminated B-cell leukemia. Mice injected with B-cells expressing ZAP-70 showed a prominently higher infiltration of the bone marrow. In vitro analysis of the response of malignant B-cells to CXCL12, the main attracting chemokine regulating trafficking of lymphocytes to the bone marrow, or to bone marrow stromal cells, revealed that ZAP-70 induces an increased response in terms of signaling and migration. These effects are probably mediated by direct participation of ZAP-70 in CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling since CXCR4 stimulation led to activation of ZAP-70 and downstream signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Akt, whereas ZAP-70 did not alter the expression of the CXCR4 receptor. In addition, subclones of primary CLL cells with high expression of ZAP-70 also showed increased migrative capacity toward CXCL12. Neutralization of CXCR4 with a monoclonal antibody resulted in impaired in vitro responses to CXCL12 and bone marrow stromal cells. We conclude that ZAP-70 enhances the migration of malignant B-cells into the supportive microenvironment found in the bone marrow mainly by enhancing signaling and migration after CXCR4 stimulation.","['Calpe, Eva', 'Purroy, Noelia', 'Carpio, Cecilia', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Carabia, Julia', 'Palacio, Carles', 'Castellvi, Josep', 'Crespo, Marta', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Calpe E', 'Purroy N', 'Carpio C', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Carabia J', 'Palacio C', 'Castellvi J', 'Crespo M', 'Bosch F']","[""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Zap70 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3849145,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081221 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-26280 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 3;8(12):e81221. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081221. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, differences between the species often result in mice being unreliable as preclinical models for human disease. One difference that might play a role in lowering the predictivity of mice models to human diseases is age. Despite the important role age plays in medicine, it is too often considered only casually when considering mouse models. METHODS: We developed the mouse-Age Phenotype Knowledgebase, which holds knowledge about age-related phenotypic patterns in mice. The knowledgebase was extensively populated with literature-derived data using text mining techniques. We then mapped between ages in humans and mice by comparing the age distribution pattern for 887 diseases in both species. RESULTS: The knowledgebase was populated with over 9800 instances generated by a text-mining pipeline. The quality of the data was manually evaluated, and was found to be of high accuracy (estimated precision >86%). Furthermore, grouping together diseases that share similar age patterns in mice resulted in clusters that mirror actual biomedical knowledge. Using these data, we matched age distribution patterns in mice and in humans, allowing for age differences by shifting either of the patterns. High correlation (r(2)>0.5) was found for 223 diseases. The results clearly indicate a difference in the age mapping between different diseases: age 30 years in human is mapped to 120 days in mice for Leukemia, but to 295 days for Anemia. Based on these results we generated a mice-to-human age map which is publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: We present here the development of the mouse-APK, its population with literature-derived data and its use to map ages in mice and human for 223 diseases. These results present a further step made to bridging the gap between humans and mice in biomedical research.","['Geifman, Nophar', 'Rubin, Eitan']","['Geifman N', 'Rubin E']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Medical Sciences and The National Institute of Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['*Aging', 'Animals', 'Data Mining/*methods', '*Databases, Factual', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Knowledge Bases', 'Mice', 'Species Specificity']",PMC3849212,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081114 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-30358 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 3;8(12):e81114. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081114. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we evaluated the stability, bioavailability, and hypersensitivity of Delta(12)-PGJ3. The stability of Delta(12)-PGJ3 was evaluated under simulated conditions using artificial gastric and intestinal juice. The bioavailability of Delta(12)-PGJ3 in systemic circulation was demonstrated upon intraperitoneal injection into mice by LC-MS/MS. Delta(12)-PGJ3 being a downstream metabolite of PGD3 was tested in vitro using primary mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and in vivo mouse models for airway hypersensitivity. ZK118182, a synthetic PG analog with potent PGD2 receptor (DP)-agonist activity and a drug candidate in current clinical trials, was used for toxicological comparison. Delta(12)-PGJ3 was relatively more stable in simulated gastric juice than in simulated intestinal juice that followed first-order kinetics of degradation. Intraperitoneal injection into mice revealed that Delta(12)-PGJ3 was bioavailable and well absorbed into systemic circulation with a Cmax of 263 microg/L at 12 h. Treatment of BMMCs with ZK118182 for 12 h resulted in increased production of histamine, while Delta(12)-PGJ3 did not induce degranulation in BMMCs nor increase histamine. In addition, in vivo testing for hypersensitivity in mice showed that ZK118182 induces higher airways hyperresponsiveness when compared Delta(12)-PGJ3 and/or PBS control. Based on the stability studies, our data indicates that intraperitoneal route of administration of Delta(12)-PGJ3 was favorable than oral administration to achieve effective pharmacological levels in the plasma against leukemia. Delta(12)-PGJ3 failed to increase histamine and IL-4 in BMMCs, which is in agreement with reduced airway hyperresponsiveness in mice. In summary, our studies suggest Delta(12)-PGJ3 to be a promising bioactive metabolite for further evaluation as a potential drug candidate for treating CML.","['Kudva, Avinash K', 'Kaushal, Naveen', 'Mohinta, Sonia', 'Kennett, Mary J', 'August, Avery', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Prabhu, K Sandeep']","['Kudva AK', 'Kaushal N', 'Mohinta S', 'Kennett MJ', 'August A', 'Paulson RF', 'Prabhu KS']","['Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131202,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (delta12-prostaglandin J3)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Biological Availability', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', '*Fatty Acids, Omega-3/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Prostaglandins/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",PMC3846793,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0080622 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-29731 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 2;8(12):e80622. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080622. eCollection 2013.,,,,,"['R01 CA175576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA175576-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivating p53 mutations are uncommon in non-complex karyotype leukemias, thus the p53-pathway must be inactivated by other mechanisms. The Apoptosis Stimulating Protein of p53-2 (ASPP2) is a damage-inducible p53-binding protein that enhances apoptosis at least in part through a p53-mediated pathway. We have previously shown, that ASPP2 is an independent haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in vivo. Now, we reveal that ASPP2 expression is significantly attenuated in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia - especially in patients with an unfavorable prognostic risk profile and patients who fail induction chemotherapy. In line, knock down of ASPP2 in expressing leukemia cell lines and native leukemic blasts attenuates damage-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, cultured blasts derived from high-risk leukemias fail to induce ASPP2 expression upon anthracycline treatment. The mechanisms of ASPP2 dysregulation are unknown. We provide evidence that attenuation of ASPP2 is caused by hypermethylation of the promoter and 5'UTR regions in native leukemia blasts. Together, our results suggest that ASPP2 contributes to the biology of leukemia and expression should be further explored as a potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarker to monitor therapy responses in acute leukemia.","['Schittenhelm, Marcus M', 'Illing, Barbara', 'Ahmut, Figen', 'Rasp, Katharina Henriette', 'Blumenstock, Gunnar', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Lopez, Charles D', 'Kampa-Schittenhelm, Kerstin M']","['Schittenhelm MM', 'Illing B', 'Ahmut F', 'Rasp KH', 'Blumenstock G', 'Dohner K', 'Lopez CD', 'Kampa-Schittenhelm KM']","['University Hospital Tubingen, Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, Immunology and Pulmology, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP53BP2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3842400,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0080193 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-23249 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 27;8(11):e80193. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080193. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the Emu-TCL1 (TCL1) transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia development. Inhibition of BTK in primary human CLL cells by small interfering RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib. Collectively, our data confirm the importance of kinase-functional BTK in CLL.","['Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Bojnik, Engin', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Stefanovski, Matthew R', 'Goettl, Virginia M', 'Smucker, Kelly A', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Dubovsky, Jason A', 'Towns, William H', 'MacMurray, Jessica', 'Harrington, Bonnie K', 'Davis, Melanie E', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Chang, Betty Y', 'Buggy, Joseph J', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Byrd, John C', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Woyach JA', 'Bojnik E', 'Ruppert AS', 'Stefanovski MR', 'Goettl VM', 'Smucker KA', 'Smith LL', 'Dubovsky JA', 'Towns WH', 'MacMurray J', 'Harrington BK', 'Davis ME', 'Gobessi S', 'Laurenti L', 'Chang BY', 'Buggy JJ', 'Efremov DG', 'Byrd JC', 'Johnson AJ']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology']",PMC3931190,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35991-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-515361 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 20;123(8):1207-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-515361.

Herein, we investigated the cellular determinants for the activity of the novel CD33/CD3-directed bispecific T-cell engager antibody, AMG 330. In the presence of T cells, AMG 330 was highly active against human AML cell lines and primary AML cells in a dose- and effector to target cell ratio-dependent manner. Using cell lines engineered to express wild-type CD33 at increased levels, we found a quantitative relationship between AMG 330 cytotoxicity and CD33 expression; in contrast, AMG 330 cytotoxicity was neither affected by common CD33 single nucleotide polymorphisms nor expression of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, P-glycoprotein or breast cancer resistance protein. Unlike bivalent CD33 antibodies, AMG 330 did not reduce surface CD33 expression. The epigenetic modifier drugs, panobinostat and azacitidine, increased CD33 expression in some cell lines and augmented AMG 330-induced cytotoxicity. These findings demonstrate that AMG 330 has potent CD33-dependent cytolytic activity in vitro, which can be further enhanced with other clinically available therapeutics. As it neither modulates CD33 expression nor is affected by ABC transporter activity, AMG 330 is highly promising for clinical exploration as it may overcome some limitations of previous CD33-targeted agents.","['Laszlo, George S', 'Gudgeon, Chelsea J', 'Harrington, Kimberly H', ""Dell'Aringa, Justine"", 'Newhall, Kathryn J', 'Means, Gary D', 'Sinclair, Angus M', 'Kischel, Roman', 'Frankel, Stanley R', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Laszlo GS', 'Gudgeon CJ', 'Harrington KH', ""Dell'Aringa J"", 'Newhall KJ', 'Means GD', 'Sinclair AM', 'Kischel R', 'Frankel SR', 'Walter RB']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '6Z4B5PJ4OP (AMG 330)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Antibodies/chemistry', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*chemistry', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/chemistry', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry', 'Indoles/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Panobinostat', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism']",PMC3901068,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/03/22 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36113-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-09-527044 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jan 23;123(4):554-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-09-527044.

We demonstrated rapid induction of deep molecular remissions in adults, which has been recently confirmed in a case report involving a child with B-ALL.

Reports in adult patients describe a range of effects of TK inhibitors on the kidney, including hypertension, proteinuria, acute kidney injury, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA); however, there are only a few reports of TK-inhibitor-associated nephrotic syndrome. METHODS: We report four pediatric patients with various malignancies (chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and glioma/renal cell carcinoma) who developed nephrotic syndrome during treatment with TK inhibitors (imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib, and quizartinib). One of the four patients also had clinical features of TMA. RESULTS: Three of the four patients achieved complete remission of nephrotic syndrome with discontinuation of the TK inhibitor and have had no additional nephrotic syndrome relapses to date. The temporal relationship of nephrotic syndrome onset to TK-inhibitor therapy and resolution of nephrotic syndrome with cessation of therapy strongly imply an association in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: TK inhibitors are important therapies in pediatric cancer, and their use is expanding. Nephrotic syndrome with or without features of TMA is a potential complication of these therapies in children.","['Ruebner, Rebecca L', 'Copelovitch, Lawrence', 'Evageliou, Nicholas F', 'Denburg, Michelle R', 'Belasco, Jean B', 'Kaplan, Bernard S']","['Ruebner RL', 'Copelovitch L', 'Evageliou NF', 'Denburg MR', 'Belasco JB', 'Kaplan BS']","[""Division of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA, ruebnerr@email.chop.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20131207,Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glioma/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2015/02/03 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00467-013-2696-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 2014 May;29(5):863-9. doi: 10.1007/s00467-013-2696-0.

The consistent association of anthracylines (e.g., epirubicin and idarubicin) in inducing therapy-related acute leukemias (t-AL) with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement suggests that MLL translocations are causative events for t-AL. Using asymmetric multiplex PCR strategy followed by direct DNA sequencing, we characterized the genomic breakpoints of the MLL and AFF1 genes in two patients who developed t-AL with t(4;11)(q21;q23). Chemotherapeutic treatment of the primary disease in both patients included topoisomerase II (topo II) targeting agents. In one case, the MLL breakpoint was located in intron 9 at nucleotide position chr11:118354284 while the AFF1 breakpoint was in intron 3 at nucleotide position chr4:87992070. The breakpoint junction sequences revealed an insertion of two nucleotides at the MLL-AFF1 junction. In the other patient, the MLL breakpoint was located in intron 11 at nucleotide position chr11:118359130-32 and the AFF1 break was in intron 3 at nucleotide position chr4:87996215-17. The MLL breakpoint found in the latter patient was identical to that of two previously reported cases, strongly suggesting the presence of a preferential site of DNA cleavage in the presence of topo II inhibitor. In addition, microhomologies at the breakpoint junctions were indicative of DNA repair by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. This study further supports the evidence that MLL breakpoints in therapy-related acute leukemia with MLL-AFF1 are clustered in the telomeric half of the breakpoint cluster region that contains topo II recognition sites.","['Hasan, Syed Khizer', 'Barba, Gianluca', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Hasan SK', 'Barba G', 'Metzler M', 'Divona M', 'Ottone T', 'Cicconi L', 'Falini B', 'Mecucci C', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Laboratorio di Neuro-Oncoematologia, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/drug therapy', '*Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics', 'Epirubicin/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/10/03 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22135 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Mar;53(3):248-54. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22135.

For example, while TNFR1 mediates neurodegenerative effects in multiple sclerosis, TNFR2 is protective and contributes to remyelination. The exact mode of TNFR2 action, however, is poorly understood. Here, we show that TNFR2-mediated activation of the PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway in primary astrocytes increased the expression of neuroprotective genes, including that encoding the neurotrophic cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). To investigate whether intercellular signaling between TNFR2-stimulated astrocytes and oligodendrocytes plays a role in oligodendrocyte maturation, we established an astrocyte-oligodendrocyte coculture model, composed of primary astrocytes from huTNFR2-transgenic (tgE1335) mice and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from wild-type mice, capable of differentiating into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. In this model, selective stimulation of human TNFR2 on astrocytes, promoted differentiation of cocultured OPCs to myelin basic protein-positive mature oligodendrocytes.

These observations lend compelling weight to the application of PI3K inhibitors in the therapy of T-ALL. Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of the pan-PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 (BKM120), an orally bioavailable 2,6-dimorpholino pyrimidine derivative, which has entered clinical trials for solid tumors, on both T-ALL cell lines and patient samples. BKM120 treatment resulted in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, being cytotoxic to a panel of T-ALL cell lines and patient T lymphoblasts, and promoting a dose- and time-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and S6RP. BKM120 maintained its pro-apoptotic activity against Jurkat cells even when cocultured with MS-5 stromal cells, which mimic the bone marrow microenvironment. Remarkably, BKM120 synergized with chemotherapeutic agents currently used for treating T-ALL patients. Moreover, in vivo administration of BKM120 to a subcutaneous xenotransplant model of human T-ALL significantly delayed tumor growth, thus prolonging survival time. Taken together, our findings indicate that BKM120, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, may be an efficient treatment for T-ALLs that have aberrant upregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway.","['Lonetti, A', 'Antunes, I L', 'Chiarini, F', 'Orsini, E', 'Buontempo, F', 'Ricci, F', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Pagliaro, P', 'Melchionda, F', 'Pession, A', 'Bertaina, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Barata, J T', 'Martelli, A M']","['Lonetti A', 'Antunes IL', 'Chiarini F', 'Orsini E', 'Buontempo F', 'Ricci F', 'Tazzari PL', 'Pagliaro P', 'Melchionda F', 'Pession A', 'Bertaina A', 'Locatelli F', 'McCubrey JA', 'Barata JT', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Cancer Biology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', '1] Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Pavia, Italy [2] Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusion Center, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusion Center, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusion Center, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, University of Bologna, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, University of Bologna, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Oncoematologia Pediatrica, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncoematologia Pediatrica, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', '1] Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy [2] Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Pavia, Italy [3] Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131106,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NVP-BKM120)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013369 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.369 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1196-206. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.369.

The approval was based on the FDA review of data from 111 patients with CML in CP or in AP who had received two or more prior TKIs, including imatinib. Major cytogenetic response was achieved in 18% of patients with CP, with a median response duration of 12.5 months. Major hematologic response was achieved in 14% of patients with AP, with a median response duration of 4.7 months. The FDA safety evaluation was based on submitted data from 163 patients with CP or AP CML who had received at least one dose of omacetaxine mepesuccinate. The safety evaluation was limited by the single-arm design of the clinical trials as conducted in a small number of previously treated patients. The most common (>/=20%) adverse reactions of any grade in enrolled patients included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, asthenia, injection site reaction, pyrexia, and infection. The FDA concluded that omacetaxine mepesuccinate has shown activity and a favorable benefit-to-risk profile for the studied population of adult patients with CML (CP or AP) with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more TKIs.

Thus, new drugs targeting LSCs are urgently needed. Triptolide (TPL) is cytotoxic to LSCs. Low dose of TPL enhances the cytotoxicity of idarubicin (IDA) in LSCs. In this study, the ability of TPL to induce apoptosis in leukemic stem cell (LSC)-like cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG1a was investigated. LSC-like cells sorted from KG1a were subjected to cell cycle analysis and different treatments, and then followed by in vitro methyl thiazole tetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay. The effects of different drug combinations on cell viability, intracellular reactive-oxygen species (ROS) activity, colony-forming ability and apoptotic status were also examined. Combination index-isobologram analysis indicates a synergistic effect between TPL and IDA, which inhibits the colony-forming ability of LSC-like cells and induces their apoptosis. We further investigated the expression of Nrf2, HIF-1alpha and their downstream target genes. LSC-like cells treated with both TPL and IDA have increased levels of ROS, decreased expression of Nrf2 and HIF-1alpha pathways. Our findings indicate that the synergistic cytotoxicity of TPL and IDA in LSCs-like cells may attribute to both induction of ROS and inhibition of the Nrf2 and HIF-1alpha pathways.","['Liu, Y', 'Chen, F', 'Wang, S', 'Guo, X', 'Shi, P', 'Wang, W', 'Xu, B']","['Liu Y', 'Chen F', 'Wang S', 'Guo X', 'Shi P', 'Wang W', 'Xu B']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3877540,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/06/13 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013467 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.467 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Dec 5;4:e948. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.467.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the roles of triptolide in apoptosis and cell signaling events in human leukemia cell lines and primary human leukemia blasts. Triptolide selectively induced caspase-dependent cell death that was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that triptolide dramatically induced ROCK1 cleavage/activation and MLC and MYPT phosphorylation. ROCK1 was cleaved and activated by caspase-3, rather than RhoA. Inhibiting MLC phosphorylation by ML-7 significantly attenuated triptolide-mediated apoptosis, caspase activation, and cytochrome c release. In addition, ROCK1 inhibition also abrogated MLC and MYPT phosphorylation. Our in vivo study showed that both ROCK1 activation and MLC phosphorylation were associated with the tumor growth inhibition caused by triptolide in mouse leukemia xenograft models. Collectively, these findings suggest that triptolide-mediated ROCK1 activation and MLC phosphorylation may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating hematological malignancies.","['Liu, L', 'Li, G', 'Li, Q', 'Jin, Z', 'Zhang, L', 'Zhou, J', 'Hu, X', 'Zhou, T', 'Chen, J', 'Gao, N']","['Liu L', 'Li G', 'Li Q', 'Jin Z', 'Zhang L', 'Zhou J', 'Hu X', 'Zhou T', 'Chen J', 'Gao N']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, 3rd Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ROCK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'rho-Associated Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3877542,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/06/13 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013469 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.469 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Dec 5;4:e941. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.469.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of this, Notch is often upregulated in cancer and current efforts point to developing drugs that block its activation. Notch receptor endocytosis towards acidic compartments is a recently appreciated determinant of signaling activation. Vacuolar H(+) ATPase (V-ATPase) is responsible for acidification of endocytic organelles and mutants in V-ATPase subunit encoding genes in model organisms have been recently shown to display loss of Notch signaling. Here, we show that administration of BafilomycinA1 (BafA1), a highly specific V-ATPase inhibitor decreases Notch signaling during Drosophila and Zebrafish development, and in human cells in culture. In normal breast cells, we find that BafA1 treatment leads to accumulation of Notch in the endo-lysosomal system, and reduces its processing and signaling activity. In Notch-addicted breast cancer cells, BafA1 treatment reduces growth in cells expressing membrane tethered forms of Notch, while sparing cells expressing cytoplasmic forms. In contrast, we find that V-ATPase inhibition reduces growth of leukemia cells, without affecting Notch activatory cleavage. However, consistent with the emerging roles of V-ATPase in controlling multiple signaling pathways, in these cells Akt activation is reduced, as it is also the case in BafA1-treated breast cancer cells. Our data support V-ATPase inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach to counteract tumor growth via signaling pathways regulated at the endo-lysosomal level.","['Kobia, Francis', 'Duchi, Serena', 'Deflorian, Gianluca', 'Vaccari, Thomas']","['Kobia F', 'Duchi S', 'Deflorian G', 'Vaccari T']","['IFOM, Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare at IFOM-IEO Campus, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milano, Italy.', 'IFOM, Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare at IFOM-IEO Campus, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milano, Italy.', 'IFOM, Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare at IFOM-IEO Campus, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milano, Italy.', 'IFOM, Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare at IFOM-IEO Campus, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milano, Italy.

First, the standard 7 + 3 protocol for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was developed 40 years ago, and with some adaptations, has stood the test of time. Second, the 1 millionth hematopoietic cell transplant was recorded this year. Stem cell transplant, the first reported by Dr E. Donnall Thomas in 1957, had been considered a rare procedure until about a decade ago. Today, it has become a proven and often life-saving therapy for patients with acute leukemia. Advances in the treatment of patients with AML continue to take place, many of which relate to an increased understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of known subtypes. Forty years ago, the regimen that has come to be known as 7+3 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was born [1,2]. Cytosine arabinoside, or arabinosylcytosine as it was then called, was given as a continuous intravenous infusion of 100 mg/m(2) for 7 days, and the anthracycline, daunorubicin, was administered at 45 mg/m(2) intravenously for 3 days. Sixteen patients were originally treated on this protocol, and 5 of 8 previously untreated and 2 of 8 previously treated patients achieved a complete response (CR). This regimen has withstood the test of time. Attempts to add or substitute other agents have not yielded superior results. The only major contemporary change is that a higher dose of daunorubicin is safe and has become the standard of care [3].","['Rowe, Jacob M']",['Rowe JM'],"['Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, 31096 Haifa, Israel; Rambam Health Care Campus, Department of Hematology, Haifa, Israel; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA; Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Department of Hematology, Jerusalem 91031, Israel.

A significant proportion of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients are ""elderly"": in the past the aim of therapy in this subset of patients was only to contain the leukaemic mass, but nowadays, with the advent of the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, also elderly patients can access these treatments. We want to assess if even old CML patients, with a correct geriatric evaluation, can be successfully treated with protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: A complete geriatric evaluation in 16 old CML patients aged >65years treated with TKI was performed in order to assess the comorbidity, the polypharmacy and the cognitive, physical and psychological states. The Charlson comorbity index (CCI) and the polypharmacy were correlated to the obtained cytogenetic response. Seven scales of geriatric evaluation were used to assess the autonomy of patients before they were included into the study. RESULTS: In our cohort of elderly patients treated with imatinib, comorbidities and polypharmaco-therapy demonstrated an influence on TKI therapeutic success. In fact, the majority of complete cytogenetic response was obtained by patients who presented a low score of CCI and did not take any other drugs other than TKI. CONCLUSION: Also old chronic myeloid leukaemia patients can benefit from TKI treatment if a good cooperation between the haematologist and the geriatrician is established.","['Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Ubertis, Anna', 'Artuso, Silvia', 'Bucelli, Cristina', 'Radice, Tommaso', 'Zappa, Manuela', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Mari, Daniela', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino']","['Iurlo A', 'Ubertis A', 'Artuso S', 'Bucelli C', 'Radice T', 'Zappa M', 'Cattaneo D', 'Mari D', 'Cortelezzi A']","[""Hematology and Transplantation Unit, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan, Italy.

The most immature leukemia cells may be more resistant to therapy than the bulk of more differentiated blasts. We studied 42 patients with childhood ALL treated according to the ALL-BFM 2000 protocol. At diagnosis, we determined the immunophenotype and the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity of the leukemic cells. Additionally, we investigated the expression of CD34, CD38 and CD45 to define a population of immunophenotypically immature cells (CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low)). We then studied levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy (day 33) to determine therapy response. Including all cases (n = 42), there was no correlation between ALDH positive cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low) cells and MRD levels. A subset of 18 ALLs displayed a more mature phenotype with low-ALDH positivity (< 1%). Analyzing this cohort, ALDH positive blasts overlapped with the CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low) population. The initial rate of ALDH positivity correlated with MRD levels at day 33 of therapy (r = 0.61, P < .01). We conclude that in pediatric ALL, ALDH positivity as a marker of immaturity and stemness has prognostic significance only in phenotypically mature cases when the ALDH activity is not a property of the majority of the leukemic blasts. In case of an immature ALL phenotype, ALDH activity might be an inherent characteristic of the whole leukemia and is not limited to a more immature subpopulation that could confer to resistance and increased MRD-levels during therapy.","['Ahlers, Jorg', 'Witte, Kai-Erik', 'Schwarze, C Philipp', 'Lang, Peter', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Ebinger, Martin']","['Ahlers J', 'Witte KE', 'Schwarze CP', 'Lang P', 'Handgretinger R', 'Ebinger M']","[""Klinikum Chemnitz, Children's Hospital , Chemnitz , Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Time Factors']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2013.859189 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 May;31(4):303-10. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2013.859189.

DESIGN: Newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia received imatinib 400 mg twice daily and were monitored quarterly for up to 18 months. Cytogenetic testing was performed by karyotyping using BM or by fluorescence in situ hybridization using PB. Molecular testing was performed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using BM and PB. RESULTS: Significant pairwise correlations were found between results obtained by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using PB or BM (all pairwise correlations >0.8; P < .001). At 12 months, cytogenetic response by karyotyping correlated well with response by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A median 2.579-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 level from a standardized baseline correlated with fluorescence in situ hybridization-negative status. Patients with greater than 2-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 level at 3, 6, and 9 months were more likely to achieve major molecular response at 18 months than those with 2-log reduction or less. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the feasibility of molecular monitoring using PB and suggest that molecular monitoring conducted at a single reliable reference laboratory can adequately track response without invasive BM testing. Our findings are consistent with other work indicating that early response to imatinib predicts favorable long-term outcome.","['Akard, Luke P', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Warsi, Ghulam', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Ericson, Solveig G', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Akard LP', 'Cortes JE', 'Albitar M', 'Goldberg SL', 'Warsi G', 'Wetzler M', 'Ericson SG', 'Radich JP']","['From the Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stem Cell Transplantation Program, St. Francis Hospital and Health Centers, Indianapolis, Indiana (Dr Akard); the Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston (Dr Cortes); the Departments of Oncology/Hematopathology and Research and Development, NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, California (Dr Albitar); the Division of Leukemia, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey (Dr Goldberg); Biostatistics (Dr Warsi) and Oncology Clinical Development (Dr Ericson), Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey; the Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York (Dr Wetzler); and the Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington (Dr Radich).']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2013-0584-OA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2014 Sep;138(9):1186-92. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2013-0584-OA.

AML, however, remains difficult to treat as many patients will still ultimately relapse and die of their disease. This is particularly true in AML patients with identified FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) molecular mutations, which typically confers a poor prognosis. The FLT3-ITD mutation occurs in about one-quarter of patients diagnosed with AML. Oftentimes, these patients are referred for early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in hopes of overcoming this poor prognostic factor. Several studies have demonstrated some benefit with HSCT in patients with FLT3-ITD mutation. However, recent data suggested that FLT3-ITD mutation remains a poor prognostic factor even after early HSCT; these patients remain at risk for early relapse after transplantation, emphasizing ongoing efforts to explore maintenance therapy with FLT3-ITD inhibitors in the post-transplant setting.","['Hu, Bei', 'Vikas, Praveen', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Savani, Bipin N']","['Hu B', 'Vikas P', 'Mohty M', 'Savani BN']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131206,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Carbazoles/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Furans', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/10/30 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.857596 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Apr;7(2):301-15. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.857596.

Malignancies occurring in infants often have different clinical and biological behavior in comparison to older children. This study was performed with an aim to find out the profile of infantile cancers at a tertiary care cancer center in South India. METHODS: The present study was a retrospective analysis of infants presenting with malignancy between 2003 and 2012 to our center in South India. RESULT: A total of 4588 pediatric patients were registered in the Department of Pediatric Oncology at our institute between 2003 and 2012. Among those, 266 (5.79%) of the patients were infants (0-1 years). There were 65.75% males and 34.25% females. Solid tumors were the most common malignancy in this age group (72.56%). Leukemias were observed in 67 (25.19%) infants. ALL was the most common hematological malignancy (17.29%) followed by AML (5.64%). Common solid tumors in descending orders were neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, renal tumors, germ cell tumors, retinoblastoma and hepatoblastoma. Thirteen (4.89%) neonates were seen in our study. The most common malignancy in neonates was neuroblastoma. CONCLUSION: The distribution of malignancy in infants is quite different from that which is found in older children. Although neuroblastoma is the most common infantile tumor in western countries, in our study leukemia is the most common infantile malignancy. Embryonal tumors such as neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, retinoblastoma, and hepatoblastoma were more prevalent in infants. Solid tumors were the most common malignancy in infants which is followed by leukemia.","['Das, Umesh', 'Appaji, L', 'Kumari, B S Aruna', 'Lakshmaiah, K C', 'Padma, M', 'Kavitha, S', 'Sathyanarayanan, Vishwanath']","['Das U', 'Appaji L', 'Kumari BS', 'Lakshmaiah KC', 'Padma M', 'Kavitha S', 'Sathyanarayanan V']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology , Banglore, Karnataka , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131205,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Pediatrics/methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2013/12/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2013.852644 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Sep;31(6):489-97. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2013.852644.

We previously reported BCR-ABL down-regulation of a novel haematopoietic regulator, CCN3, in CML; CCN3 is a non-canonical NOTCH1 ligand. This study characterizes the NOTCH1-CCN3 signalling axis in CML. In K562 cells, BCR-ABL silencing reduced full-length NOTCH1 (NOTCH1-FL) and inhibited the cleavage of NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NOTCH1-ICD), resulting in decreased expression of the NOTCH1 targets c-MYC and HES1. K562 cells stably overexpressing CCN3 (K562/CCN3) or treated with recombinant CCN3(rCCN3) showed a significant reduction in NOTCH1 signalling (> 50% reduction in NOTCH1-ICD, p < 0.05).Gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), which blocks NOTCH1 signalling, reduced K562/CCN3 colony formation but increased that of K562/control cells. GSI combined with either rCCN3 or imatinib reduced K562 colony formation with enhanced reduction of NOTCH1 signalling observed with combination treatments. We demonstrate an oncogenic role for NOTCH1 in CML and suggest that BCR-ABL disruption of NOTCH1-CCN3 signalling contributes to the pathogenesis of CML.","['Suresh, Sukanya', 'McCallum, Lynn', 'Crawford, Lisa J', 'Lu, Wan Hua', 'Sharpe, Daniel J', 'Irvine, Alexandra E']","['Suresh S', 'McCallum L', 'Crawford LJ', 'Lu WH', 'Sharpe DJ', 'Irvine AE']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCN3 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nephroblastoma Overexpressed Protein)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Nephroblastoma Overexpressed Protein/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection']",PMC4314772,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.4246 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2013 Nov;231(3):378-87. doi: 10.1002/path.4246.,,,,,,,"['2013 The Authors.

BTK mediates signaling downstream of a number of receptors. Pharmacologic targeting of BTK using ibrutinib (previously PCI-32765) has recently shown encouraging clinical activity in a range of lymphoid malignancies. This study reports for the first time that ibrutinib inhibits blast proliferation from human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and that treatment with ibrutinib significantly augmented cytotoxic activities of standard AML chemotherapy cytarabine or daunorubicin. Here we describe that BTK is constitutively phosphorylated in the majority of AML samples tested, with BTK phosphorylation correlating highly with the cell's cytotoxic sensitivity toward ibrutinib. BTK-targeted RNAi knockdown reduced colony-forming capacity of primary AML blasts and proliferation of AML cell lines. We showed that ibrutinib binds at nanomolar range to BTK. Furthermore, we showed ibrutinib's antiproliferative effects in AML are mediated via an inhibitory effect on downstream nuclear factor-kappaB survival pathways. Moreover, ibrutinib inhibited AML cell adhesion to bone marrow stroma. Furthermore, these effects of ibrutinib in AML were seen at comparable concentrations efficacious in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These results provide a biological rationale for clinical evaluation of BTK inhibition in AML patients.","['Rushworth, Stuart A', 'Murray, Megan Y', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Rushworth SA', 'Murray MY', 'Zaitseva L', 'Bowles KM', 'MacEwan DJ']","['Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35994-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-06-511154 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 20;123(8):1229-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-06-511154.

Multiple independent studies have documented that the presence and quantity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are strongly correlated with increased survival. However, because of methodological factors, the exact effect of TILs on prognosis has remained enigmatic, and inclusion of TILs in standard prognostic panels has been limited. For example, some reports enumerate all CD3(+) cells, some count only cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, and the criteria used to score tumors as TIL-positive or TIL-negative are inconsistent among studies. To address this limitation, we introduce a robust digital DNA-based assay, termed QuanTILfy, to count TILs and assess T cell clonality in tissue samples, including tumors. We demonstrate the clonal specificity of this approach by the diagnosis of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the accurate, sensitive, and highly reproducible measurement of TILs in primary and metastatic ovarian cancer. Our experiments demonstrate an association between higher TIL counts and improved survival among women with ovarian cancer, and are consistent with previous observations that the immune response against ovarian cancer is a meaningful and independent prognostic factor. Surprisingly, the TIL repertoire is diverse for all tumors in the study with no notable oligoclonal expansions. Furthermore, because variability in the measurement and characterization of TILs has limited their clinical utility as biomarkers, these results highlight the significant translational potential of a robust, standardizable DNA-based assay to assess TILs in a variety of cancer types.","['Robins, Harlan S', 'Ericson, Nolan G', 'Guenthoer, Jamie', ""O'Briant, Kathy C"", 'Tewari, Muneesh', 'Drescher, Charles W', 'Bielas, Jason H']","['Robins HS', 'Ericson NG', 'Guenthoer J', ""O'Briant KC"", 'Tewari M', 'Drescher CW', 'Bielas JH']","['Herbold Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Lineage', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC4026017,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['5/214/214ra169 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.3007247 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2013 Dec 4;5(214):214ra169. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3007247.,,,,,"['P50 CA083636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES019319/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES019319/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS574644'],,,['Sci Transl Med. 2013 Dec 4;5(214):214fs42.

Human and mouse ESCs share many features, yet have distinctive aspects, including fundamental differences in the signaling pathways and cell cycle controls that support self-renewal. Here, we explore the molecular basis of human ESC self-renewal using Bayesian network machine learning to integrate cell-type-specific, high-throughput data for gene function discovery. We integrated high-throughput ESC data from 83 human studies (~1.8 million data points collected under 1,100 conditions) and 62 mouse studies (~2.4 million data points collected under 1,085 conditions) into separate human and mouse predictive networks focused on ESC self-renewal to analyze shared and distinct functional relationships among protein-coding gene orthologs. Computational evaluations show that these networks are highly accurate, literature validation confirms their biological relevance, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validation supports our predictions. Our results reflect the importance of key regulatory genes known to be strongly associated with self-renewal and pluripotency in both species (e.g., POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG), identify metabolic differences between species (e.g., threonine metabolism), clarify differences between human and mouse ESC developmental signaling pathways (e.g., leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-activated JAK/STAT in mouse; NODAL/ACTIVIN-A-activated fibroblast growth factor in human), and reveal many novel genes and pathways predicted to be functionally associated with self-renewal in each species.

Case-control studies have been performed to elucidate the role of A2455G in cancer; however, the results are conflicting and heterogeneous. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer susceptibility and A2455G (64,593 cases and 91,056 controls from 272 studies) polymorphism in different inheritance models. We used odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to assess the strength of the association. Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was observed in any genetic model (dominant model, odds ration [OR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-1.25; recessive model: OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.29-1.54; additive model: OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.35-1.65) when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, the elevated risk remained for subgroups of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, head and neck cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, and prostate cancer, but these associations vary in different ethnic populations. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests the participation of A2455G in the susceptibility for some cancers, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and so on. Moreover, ethnicity, histological type of cancer, and smokers seem to contribute to varying expressions of the A2455G on some cancers risk. In addition, our work also points out the importance of new studies for A2455G polymorphism in some cancer types, such as gallbladder cancer, Indians of breast cancer, and Caucasians of ovarians, because these cancer types had high heterogeneity in this meta-analysis (I(2) > 75%).","['Qin, Jun', 'Zhang, Jin-Xia', 'Li, Xiao-Ping', 'Wu, Bu-Qiang', 'Chen, Guang-Bin', 'He, Xiao-Feng']","['Qin J', 'Zhang JX', 'Li XP', 'Wu BQ', 'Chen GB', 'He XF']","['Department of General Surgery, Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi, 046000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20131205,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Publication Bias', 'Risk', 'Smoking/adverse effects']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-1443-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Apr;35(4):3363-76. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-1443-2.

We used a cultured astrocyte model to explore mechanisms of survival of CNS cells following ROS damage. We found that pretreatment with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) preserves astrocytes exposed to toxic levels of t-BHP by inhibiting an increase in intracellular ROS following t-BHP treatment. Astrocytes lacking functional Stat3 did not benefit from the pro-survival or antioxidant effects of LIF. Inhibition of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) using a chemical inhibitor or siRNA abrogates the prosurvival effects of LIF, indicating a critical role for UCP2 in modulation of mitochondrial ROS production in survival following ROS exposure. LIF treatment of astrocytes results in increased UCP2 mRNA that is accompanied by an increase in Stat3 binding to the UCP2 promoter region. Although treatment with LIF alone did not increase UCP2 protein, a combination of LIF treatment and ROS stress led to increased UCP2 protein levels. We conclude that LIF protects astrocytes from ROS-induced death by increasing UCP2 mRNA, allowing cells to respond to ROS stress by rapidly producing UCP2 protein that ultimately decreases endogenous mitochondrial ROS production.","['Lapp, Daniel W', 'Zhang, Samuel S', 'Barnstable, Colin J']","['Lapp DW', 'Zhang SS', 'Barnstable CJ']","['Department of Neural and Behavioral Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131205,United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ucp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Uncoupling Protein 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ion Channels/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Uncoupling Protein 2', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/glia.22594 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2014 Feb;62(2):159-70. doi: 10.1002/glia.22594.

The objective of this analysis was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of linifanib in cancer patients. METHODS: We pooled 7,351 linifanib plasma concentrations from 1,010 cancer patients enrolled in 13 clinical studies. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using NONMEM version 7.2. The covariates that were screened included the cancer type, co-medications, creatinine clearance, formulation, fed status, liver function markers (bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), albumin, age, sex, race, body weight, surface area and body mass index. RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and disposition best described linifanib pharmacokinetics. An increase in body weight was associated with less than proportional increases in volumes of distribution. Subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma were estimated to have 63 and 86% larger volumes of distribution, respectively, than subjects with the other cancer types. Females had 25% slower oral clearance (CL/F) than males, while subjects with colorectal cancer had 41% faster CL/F than other subjects. For linifanib bioavailability, subjects with refractory acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome had 43% lower bioavailability, evening doses were associated with 27% lower bioavailability than morning doses, and administration of linifanib under fed conditions decreased the bioavailability by 14%. Finally, the oral solution formulation showed two-fold faster absorption than the tablet formulations. CONCLUSION: The use of mixed-effects modelling allowed robust assessment of the impact of the concomitant effects of body size, different cancer types, formulation, diurnal variation, sex and food on linifanib pharmacokinetics. The developed population pharmacokinetic model describes linifanib concentrations adequately and can be used to conduct simulations or to evaluate the linifanib exposure-response relationship.","['Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Koenig, Denise', 'Carlson, Dawn']","['Salem AH', 'Koenig D', 'Carlson D']","['Clinical Development, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, AP13A-3, Dept.

Porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in a medium supplemented with pLIF during the first 22 hr, last 22 hr, or entire 44 hr duration of IVM. Oocytes in all groups tended to show enhanced nuclear maturation rates by the metaphase II (MII) stage (76.1%, 82.1%, and 86.6%, respectively) compared to the without-pLIF treatment group (69.6%, control). A significant increase in MII rate (P < 0.05) and obvious induction of cumulus expansion were observed over the whole time span (44 hr) in the IVM group. When cumulus cells were removed at 22 hr and denuded oocytes were further cultured, pLIF showed no effect on maturation rate. Oocytes matured in pLIF-supplemented medium showed a tendency for more rapid blastocyst development (21.1% vs. 16.2%, P = 0.0715). Examination of transcripts and proteins of the LIF signaling pathway in COCs revealed that LIF, LIF receptors, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are present in both cumulus cells and oocytes. The amount of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) markedly increased in both cumulus cells and oocytes cultured in pLIF-supplemented media, although oocyte p-STAT3 disappeared after 44 hr of IVM. These results suggest that the LIF/STAT3 pathway is functional during IVM of porcine oocytes, and supplementing pLIF in the IVM medium can improve oocyte maturation by activating this pathway.","['Dang-Nguyen, Thanh Quang', 'Haraguchi, Seiki', 'Kikuchi, Kazuhiro', 'Somfai, Tamas', 'Bodo, Szilard', 'Nagai, Takashi']","['Dang-Nguyen TQ', 'Haraguchi S', 'Kikuchi K', 'Somfai T', 'Bodo S', 'Nagai T']","['Animal Breeding and Reproduction Division, NARO Institute of Livestock and Grassland Science, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131226,United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Cumulus Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Oocytes/chemistry/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Swine']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/11/14 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mrd.22289 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2014 Mar;81(3):230-9. doi: 10.1002/mrd.22289.

To explore the molecular basis of CHD's neuroprotective effect, we examined whether CHD shows a cell-protective activity and has a regulatory effect on Bax and/or B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression in mouse neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R). METHODS: In order to evaluate the effects of CHD on the cytotoxicity induced from hypoxia or H/R condition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed. To explore whether the suppression of neural damage when pre-treated with CHD is associated with its anti-apoptotic effect, the CHD effect on the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was analyzed by Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity of N2a cell line was slightly increased in 42 h hypoxia condition and dramatically increased under the H/R condition. CHD treatment markedly decreased the cytotoxicity in both conditions (P<0.01, P<0.05). H/R markedly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, but slightly increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, compared with the normoxia or hypoxia group. CHD significantly decreased Bax expression (P<0.01) and slightly decreased Bcl-2 expression (P>0.05), resulted in a reduction of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in N2a cells subjected to H/R. CONCLUSION: CHD has neuroprotective effect in N2a cells subjected to H/R, which might be derived at least in part from its ability to decrease the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax.","['Ko, Chang-Nam', 'Park, In-Seo', 'Park, Seong-Uk', 'Jung, Woo-Sang', 'Moon, Sang-Kwan', 'Park, Jung-Mi', 'Kang, Chulhun', 'Cho, Ki-Ho']","['Ko CN', 'Park IS', 'Park SU', 'Jung WS', 'Moon SK', 'Park JM', 'Kang C', 'Cho KH']","['Department of Cardiology and Neurology Diseases, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131205,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '7L641RM0IY (Qing Ye Dan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Hypoxia/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Reperfusion Injury/*prevention & control']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/07/23 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11655-013-1657-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2013 Dec;19(12):940-4. doi: 10.1007/s11655-013-1657-6.

In particular, disease clustering is of major public concern in epidemiology. In this article, we propose the use of two distance-based segregation indices to test the significance of disease clustering among subjects whose locations are from a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous population. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the segregation indices and compare them with other distance-based disease clustering tests in terms of empirical size and power by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The null pattern we consider is the random labeling (RL) of cases and controls to the given locations. Along this line, we investigate the sensitivity of the size of these tests to the underlying background pattern (e.g., clustered or homogenous) on which the RL is applied, the level of clustering and number of clusters, or to differences in relative abundances of the classes. We demonstrate that differences in relative abundances have the highest influence on the empirical sizes of the tests. We also propose various non-RL patterns as alternatives to the RL pattern and assess the empirical power performances of the tests under these alternatives. We observe that the empirical size of one of the indices is more robust to the differences in relative abundances, and this index performs comparable with the best performers in literature in terms of power. We illustrate the methods on two real-life examples from epidemiology.","['Ceyhan, Elvan']",['Ceyhan E'],"['Department of Mathematics, Koc University, Sariyer, 34450, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Child', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Liver Diseases/epidemiology', '*Models, Statistical', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.6053 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2014 May 10;33(10):1662-84. doi: 10.1002/sim.6053.

Using an 8.3-kb dnd promoter that contains this 150-bp region, we generated Tg(dnd:neo-dnd) transgenic zebrafish in which the expression of Neo was detected specifically in ovarian germ cells. The transgenic fish were used to initiate primary ovarian germ cell cultures with antibiotic G418 to select ovarian germ cells and eliminate ovarian somatic cells. RT-PCR results demonstrated that the drug-selected ovarian germ cells continued to express germ-cell markers nanos3, vasa and dnd. Growth assays demonstrated that recombinant zebrafish Lif had a significant mitogenic effect on the ovarian germ cells. When long-term ovarian germ cell cultures were transplanted into two-week-old infertile larvae, they successfully colonized and directed the formation of a truncated gonad in the recipient adult fish. Histological examination of the recipient adult fish revealed that 9 out of 34 individuals (26%) possessed donor-derived cells in their gonads. The identification of zebrafish dnd promoter and the use of this promoter to generate Tg(dnd:neo-dnd) led to the success of germ cell isolation through drug selection to generate homogenous germ cells that can be used to study zebrafish germ cell biology and may lead to a cell-mediated gene transfer strategy.","['Wong, Ten-Tsao', 'Tesfamichael, Abraham', 'Collodi, Paul']","['Wong TT', 'Tesfamichael A', 'Collodi P']","['Department of Animal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (dnd1 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (m17 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (nanos3 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (ddx4 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera/embryology', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Germ Cells/*transplantation', 'Gonads/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Neomycin/*pharmacology', 'Ovary/cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/09/04 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['120234tw [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.120234tw [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2013;57(9-10):767-72. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.120234tw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) replenish progenitor and precursor cells of multiple lineages, which normally differentiate into short-lived mature circulating cells. Hematopoiesis has provided insight into the molecular basis of tissue homeostasis and malignancy. Malignant hematopoiesis, in particular acute myeloid leukemia (AML), results from impaired development or differentiation of HSCs and progenitors. Co-overexpression of HOX and TALE genes, particularly the HOXA cluster and MEIS1, is associated with AML. Clinically relevant models of AML are required to advance drug development for an aging patient cohort. RESULTS: Molecular analysis identified altered gene, microRNA, and protein expression in HOXA9/Meis1 leukemic bone marrow compared to normal controls. A candidate drug screen identified the c-Met inhibitor SU11274 for further analysis. Altered cell cycle status, apoptosis, differentiation, and impaired colony formation were shown for SU11274 in AML cell lines and primary leukemic bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: The clonal HOXA9/Meis1 AML model is amenable to drug screening analysis. The data presented indicate that human AML cells respond in a similar manner to the HOXA9/Meis1 cells, indicating pre-clinical relevance of the mouse model.","['Mulgrew, Nuala M', 'Kettyle, Laura M J', 'Ramsey, Joanne M', 'Cull, Susan', 'Smyth, Laura J', 'Mervyn, Danielle M', 'Bijl, Janet J', 'Thompson, Alexander']","['Mulgrew NM', 'Kettyle LM', 'Ramsey JM', 'Cull S', 'Smyth LJ', 'Mervyn DM', 'Bijl JJ', 'Thompson A']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0', '(((3Z)-N-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-((3,5-dimethyl-4-((4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)carbonyl)-1', 'H-pyrrol-2-yl)methylene)-N-methyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-5-sulfonamide))', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvdy.24070 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2014 Jan;243(1):172-81. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.24070.

We show here that 3-BrP causes concentration-dependent cell death of HL60 and other human myeloid leukemia cells, inducing both apoptosis and necrosis at 20-30 muM and a pure necrotic response at 60 muM. Low concentrations of 3-BrP (10-20 muM) brought about a rapid inhibition of glycolysis, which at higher concentrations was followed by the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. The combination of these effects causes concentration-dependent ATP depletion, although this cannot explain the lethality at intermediate 3-BrP concentrations (20-30 muM). The oxidative stress caused by exposure to 3-BrP was evident as a moderate overproduction of reactive oxygen species and a concentration-dependent depletion of glutathione, which was an important determinant of 3-BrP toxicity. In addition, 3-BrP caused glutathione-dependent stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K phosphorylation or activation, as well as rapid LKB-1/AMP kinase (AMPK) activation, which was later followed by Akt-mediated inactivation. Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors revealed that p38 MAPK activation enhances 3-BrP toxicity, which is conversely restrained by ERK and Akt activity. Finally, 3-BrP was seen to cooperate with antitumor agents like arsenic trioxide and curcumin in causing cell death, a response apparently mediated by both the generation of oxidative stress induced by 3-BrP and the attenuation of Akt and ERK activation by curcumin. In summary, 3-BrP cytotoxicity is the result of several combined regulatory mechanisms that might represent important targets to improve therapeutic efficacy.","['Calvino, Eva', 'Estan, Maria Cristina', 'Sanchez-Martin, Carlos', 'Brea, Rocio', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Boyano-Adanez, Maria del Carmen', 'Rial, Eduardo', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Calvino E', 'Estan MC', 'Sanchez-Martin C', 'Brea R', 'de Blas E', 'Boyano-Adanez Mdel C', 'Rial E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain (E.C., M.C.E., C.S.-M., R.B., E.B., E.R., P.A.); and Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Spain (M.C.B.-A.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyruvates)', '63JMV04GRK (bromopyruvate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/agonists/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Necrosis/chemically induced', 'Neoplasm Proteins/agonists/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/agonists/metabolism', 'Pyruvates/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/03/04 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.113.206714 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.113.206714 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2014 Feb;348(2):324-35. doi: 10.1124/jpet.113.206714.

In addition, TASK3 channels contribute to the regulation of cellular potassium homeostasis. Because TASK3 channels are important for cell viability, having putative roles in both neuronal apoptosis and oncogenesis, we sought to determine their behavior under inflammatory conditions by investigating the effect of TNFalpha on TASK3 channel current. TASK3 channels were expressed in tsA-201 cells, and the current through them was measured using whole cell voltage clamp recordings. We show that THP-1 human myeloid leukemia monocytes, co-cultured with hTASK3-transfected tsA-201 cells, can be activated by the specific Toll-like receptor 7/8 activator, R848, to release TNFalpha that subsequently enhances hTASK3 current. Both hTASK3 and mTASK3 channel activity is increased by incubation with recombinant TNFalpha (10 ng/ml for 2-15 h), but other K2P channels (hTASK1, hTASK2, hTREK1, and hTRESK) are unaffected. This enhancement by TNFalpha is not due to alterations in levels of channel expression at the membrane but rather to an alteration in channel gating. The enhancement by TNFalpha can be blocked by extracellular acidification but persists for mutated TASK3 (H98A) channels that are no longer acid-sensitive even in an acidic extracellular environment. TNFalpha action on TASK3 channels is mediated through the intracellular C terminus of the channel. Furthermore, it occurs through the ASK1 pathway and is JNK- and p38-dependent. In combination, TNFalpha activation and TASK3 channel activity can promote cellular apoptosis.","['El Hachmane, Mickael-F', 'Rees, Kathryn A', 'Veale, Emma L', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V', 'Mathie, Alistair']","['El Hachmane MF', 'Rees KA', 'Veale EL', 'Sumbayev VV', 'Mathie A']","['From the Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Central Avenue, Chatham Maritime, ME4 4TB Kent, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (KCNK9 protein, human)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR8 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (adenylate kinase 1)', 'V3DMU7PVXF (resiquimod)']",IM,"['Adenylate Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 8/agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3894323,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)33619-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.500033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jan 17;289(3):1388-401. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.500033.

Although the particular mechanism(s) responsible for their aberrant expression is not well characterized, the presence of mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes, possibly affecting their secondary structure and expression, has been described. In CLL; however, the impact and frequency of such variations have yet to be elucidated. Using a custom resequencing microarray, we screened sequence variations in 109 cancer-related pre-miRNAs in 98 CLL patients. Additionally, the primary regions of miR-29b-2/29c and miR-16-1 were analyzed by Sanger sequencing in another cohort of 213 and 193 CLL patients, respectively. Altogether, we describe six novel miR-sequence variations and the presence of SNPs (n = 27), most of which changed the miR-secondary structure. Moreover, some of the identified SNPs have a significantly different frequency in CLL when compared with a control population. Additionally, we identified a novel variation in miR-16-1 that had not been described previously in CLL patients. We show that this variation affects the expression of mature miR-16-1. We also show that the expression of another miRNA with pathogenetic relevance for CLL, namely miR-29b-2, is influenced by the presence of a polymorphic insertion, which is more frequent in CLL than in a control population. Altogether, these data suggest that sequence variations may occur during CLL development and/or progression.","['Kminkova, Jana', 'Mraz, Marek', 'Zaprazna, Kristina', 'Navrkalova, Veronika', 'Tichy, Boris', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Malcikova, Jitka', 'Cerna, Katerina', 'Rausch, Tobias', 'Benes, Vladimir', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Pospisilova, Sarka']","['Kminkova J', 'Mraz M', 'Zaprazna K', 'Navrkalova V', 'Tichy B', 'Plevova K', 'Malcikova J', 'Cerna K', 'Rausch T', 'Benes V', 'Brychtova Y', 'Doubek M', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S']","['CEITEC - Central European Institute of Technology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno 625 00, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Variation', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC4004199,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/06/25 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['bgt396 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgt396 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2014 May;35(5):992-1002. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgt396.

TC deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder usually presenting in early infancy with failure to thrive, weakness, diarrhoea, pallor, anemia, and pancytopenia or agammaglobulinemia. It can sometimes resemble neonatal leukemia or severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Diagnosis of TC deficiency is suspected based on megaloblastic anemia, elevation of total plasma homocysteine, and blood or urine methylmalonic acid. It is confirmed by studying the synthesis of TC in cultured fibroblasts, or by molecular analysis of the TCN2 gene. TC deficiency is treatable with supplemental cobalamin, but the optimal type, route and frequency of cobalamin administration and long term patient outcomes are unknown. Here we present a series of 30 patients with TC deficiency, including an update on multiple previously published patients, in order to evaluate the different treatment strategies and provide information about long term outcome. Based on the data presented, current practice appears to favour treatment of individuals with TC deficiency by intramuscular injections of hydroxy- or cyanocobalamin. In most cases presented, at least weekly injections (1 mg IM) were necessary to ensure optimal treatment. Most centres adjusted the treatment regimen based on monitoring CBC, total plasma homocysteine, plasma and urine methylmalonic acid, as well as, clinical status. Finally, continuing IM treatment into adulthood appears to be beneficial.","['Trakadis, Y J', 'Alfares, A', 'Bodamer, O A', 'Buyukavci, M', 'Christodoulou, J', 'Connor, P', 'Glamuzina, E', 'Gonzalez-Fernandez, F', 'Bibi, H', 'Echenne, B', 'Manoli, I', 'Mitchell, J', 'Nordwall, M', 'Prasad, C', 'Scaglia, F', 'Schiff, M', 'Schrewe, B', 'Touati, G', 'Tchan, M C', 'Varet, B', 'Venditti, C P', 'Zafeiriou, D', 'Rupar, C A', 'Rosenblatt, D S', 'Watkins, D', 'Braverman, N']","['Trakadis YJ', 'Alfares A', 'Bodamer OA', 'Buyukavci M', 'Christodoulou J', 'Connor P', 'Glamuzina E', 'Gonzalez-Fernandez F', 'Bibi H', 'Echenne B', 'Manoli I', 'Mitchell J', 'Nordwall M', 'Prasad C', 'Scaglia F', 'Schiff M', 'Schrewe B', 'Touati G', 'Tchan MC', 'Varet B', 'Venditti CP', 'Zafeiriou D', 'Rupar CA', 'Rosenblatt DS', 'Watkins D', 'Braverman N']","['Department of Medical Genetics, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada, john.trakadis@mail.mcgill.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131205,United States,J Inherit Metab Dis,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,7910918,"['0 (Transcobalamins)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'Q40X8H422O (Hydroxocobalamin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxocobalamin/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Transcobalamins/*deficiency', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamin B 12/therapeutic use']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10545-013-9664-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Inherit Metab Dis. 2014 May;37(3):461-73. doi: 10.1007/s10545-013-9664-5.

Dramatic improvements in the cure rates and survival outcomes for children with ALL have been seen over the past several decades; currently the 5-year survival rate for childhood ALL is more than 80%. These improvements have come about because of advances in the understanding of the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of the disease, incorporation of risk-adapted therapy, and the advent of new targeted agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Scientific advances have provided new insights into leukemogenesis, drug resistance, and host pharmacogenomics, identified novel subtypes of leukemia, and suggested potential targets for therapy. At the same time novel monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, chemotherapeutics, and cell-based treatment strategies have been developed and investigated.

It is rarely reported to cause septicemia in a patient with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The mortality rate of septicemia due to A. hydrophila is 29% to 73%. We report a case of 59-year-old female patient who was a known case of ALL, presented with the complaints of fever, lethargy and generalized weakness for one month. After taking blood samples for investigations, empirical antimicrobial therapy was started. She did not improve after 48 hours of therapy. Meanwhile blood culture revealed pure growth of A. hydrophila. After sensitivity report was available, ciprofloxacin was started. Patient became afebrile after 48 hours of treatment with ciprofloxacin. It is very vital to correctly identified and treat bacteremia due to A. hydrophila especially in the underlying leukemic patient.","['Fatima, Ambreen', 'Afridi, Faisal Iqbal', 'Qureshi, Adnan', 'Farooqi, Badar Jahan', 'Hussain, Arif']","['Fatima A', 'Afridi FI', 'Qureshi A', 'Farooqi BJ', 'Hussain A']","['Department of Microbiology, Dr. Ziauddin University Hospital, North Nazimabad Campus, Karachi.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aeromonas hydrophila/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy/etiology', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['040579197 [pii]', '12.2013/JCPSP.893895 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2013 Dec;23(12):893-5. doi: 12.2013/JCPSP.893895.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncogene loci become involved in translocations because they are accessible to the V(D)J recombination machinery. Such accessibility is predicted at cryptic recombination signal sequence (cRSS) sites ('Type 1') as well as other sites that are subject to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) ('Type 2') during early stages of thymocyte development. As chromatin accessibility markers have not been analyzed in the context of TCR-associated translocations, various genetic and epigenetic determinants of LMO2, TAL1 and TLX1 translocation breakpoint (BP) sites and BP cluster regions (BCRs) were examined in human thymocytes to establish DSB proneness and heterogeneity of BP site involvement in TCR translocations. Our data show that DSBs in BCRs are primarily induced in the presence of a genetic element of sequence vulnerability (cRSSs, transposable elements), whereas breaks at single BP sites lacking such elements are more likely induced by chance or perhaps because of patient-specific genetic vulnerability. Vulnerability to obtain DSBs is increased by features that determine chromatin organization, such as methylation status and nucleosome occupancy, although at different levels at different BP sites.","['Larmonie, N S D', 'van der Spek, A', 'Bogers, A J J C', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Langerak, A W']","['Larmonie NS', 'van der Spek A', 'Bogers AJ', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Langerak AW']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Breakpoints', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thymocytes/cytology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'V(D)J Recombination/genetics']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201363 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2013.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2014 Mar;15(2):72-81. doi: 10.1038/gene.2013.63.

METHODS: The statistics of incidence and mortality of cancer were collected from 6 population-based cancer registries in Zhejiang province, including 30 613 new incidence cases and 16 920 death cases reported in 2009. The 6 cancer registries covered population at 9 560 699 in all. The crude rate, age-standardized rate, cumulative rate (0-74 years old), cut rate (35-64 years old), age-specific rate of incidence/mortality as well as the constitution of top 10 common cancers were then calculated and analyzed. The age-standardized rate was calculated and adjusted by the Chinese standard population in 1982 as well as the Segi's world standard population. RESULTS: The crude incidence of cancer was 320.20/100 000. Age-standardized incidence by Chinese standard population and by world standard population were separately 161.99/100 000 and 207.92/100 000, the cumulative rate was 23.83% and the cut rate was 346.87/100 000. Meanwhile, the crude mortality rate was 176.97/100 000, and the age-standardized mortality by Chinese standard population and by world standard population were 79.17/100 000, 107.02/100 000, respectively; and the cumulative mortality rate was 12.23% and cut rate was 139.75/100 000. Age-specific incidence among 0-34 years old population remained low; however, the incidence among 35-39 age group increased obviously (116.46/100 000, 954 cases). The incidence among 45-49 age group elevated even more sharply (272.97/100 000, 2388 cases) and finally reached the peak among 80-84 age group (1564.36/100 000, 2272 cases). Age-specific mortality arose among 40-44 age group (48.06/100 000, 424 cases) and reached its peak among 80-84 age group (1392.23/100 000, 2022 cases) as well. The most common types of cancer were lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer and lymphoma, which accounted for 74.37% (22 763/30 613) of all new cancer cases.Lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, brain tumors and breast cancer accounted for 87.75% (14 848/16 920) of all cancer deaths. CONCLUSION: The incidence and mortality of cancer both increased in 2009 according to the statistics from cancer registry in Zhejiang province.Lung cancer, malignant tumor in digestive system and breast cancer were still the key challenges in cancer prevention and control. Meanwhile, the increased incidence of thyroid cancer should also be noticed.","['Li, Hui-zhang', 'Mao, Wei-min', 'Wang, Xiang-hui', 'Yu, Chuan-ding', 'Du, Ling-bin']","['Li HZ', 'Mao WM', 'Wang XH', 'Yu CD', 'Du LB']","['Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, Hangzhou 310022, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],7904962,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jul;47(7):592-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examined the DNA DSB response of primary bone marrow cells from t-AML patients and performed next-generation sequencing of 37 canonical homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair genes, and a subset of DNA damage response genes using tumor and paired normal DNA obtained from t-AML patients. Our results suggest that the majority of t-AML patients (11 of 15) have tumor-cell intrinsic, functional dysregulation of their DSB response. Distinct patterns of abnormal DNA damage response in myeloblasts correlated with acquired genetic alterations in TP53 and the presence of inferred chromothripsis. Furthermore, the presence of trisomy 8 in tumor cells was associated with persistently elevated levels of DSBs. Although tumor-acquired point mutations or small indels in canonical HR and NHEJ genes do not appear to be a dominant means by which t-AML leukemogenesis occurs, our functional studies suggest that an abnormal response to DNA damage is a common finding in t-AML.","['Jacoby, M A', 'De Jesus Pizarro, R E', 'Shao, J', 'Koboldt, D C', 'Fulton, R S', 'Zhou, G', 'Wilson, R K', 'Walter, M J']","['Jacoby MA', 'De Jesus Pizarro RE', 'Shao J', 'Koboldt DC', 'Fulton RS', 'Zhou G', 'Wilson RK', 'Walter MJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', '1] The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA [2] Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA [3] Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA [4] Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA [2] Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA [3] Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Comet Assay', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC4047198,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013368 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.368 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1242-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.368.

In the hematopoietic niche, they nurture hematopoietic cells, leukemia, tumors and metastasis. BMSCs secrete of a wide range of cytokines, growth factors and matrix proteins which contribute to the pro-tumorigenic marrow microenvironment. The inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha change the BMSC secretome and we hypothesized that factors produced by tumors or leukemia would also affect the BMSC secretome and investigated the interaction of leukemia cells with BMSCs. METHODS: BMSCs from healthy subjects were co-cultured with three myeloid leukemia cell lines (TF-1, TF-1alpha and K562) using a trans-well system. Following co-culture, the BMSCs and leukemia cells were analyzed by global gene expression analysis and culture supernatants were analyzed for protein expression. As a control, CD34+ cells were also cocultured with BMSCs. RESULTS: Co-culture induced leukemia cell gene expression changes in stem cell pluripotency, TGF-beta signaling and carcinoma signaling pathways. BMSCs co-cultured with leukemia cells up-regulated a number of proinflammatory genes including IL-17 signaling-related genes and IL-8 and CCL2 levels were increased in co-culture supernatants. In contrast, purine metabolism, mTOR signaling and EIF2 signaling pathways genes were up-regulated in BMSCs co-cultured with CD34+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs react to the presence of leukemia cells undergoing changes in the cytokine and chemokine secretion profiles. Thus, BMSCs and leukemia cells both contribute to the creation of a competitive niche more favorable for leukemia stem cells.","['Civini, Sara', 'Jin, Ping', 'Ren, Jiaqiang', 'Sabatino, Marianna', 'Castiello, Luciano', 'Jin, Jianjian', 'Wang, Huan', 'Zhao, Yuanlong', 'Marincola, Francesco', 'Stroncek, David']","['Civini S', 'Jin P', 'Ren J', 'Sabatino M', 'Castiello L', 'Jin J', 'Wang H', 'Zhao Y', 'Marincola F', 'Stroncek D']","['Cell Processing Section, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Building 10, Room 3C720, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892-1184, USA.

Recently, it has been demonstrated to induce both autophagy and apoptosis in human bladder and breast cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pterostilbene on HL60 human leukemia cells. Cell morphology was examined using confocal and electron microscopy. Cell viability was determined by MTT, neutral red uptake and trypan blue exclusion assays. LC3 processing was studied based on Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. Flow cytometry was used to study cell cycle distribution, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase activation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. DNA degradation was examined by gel electrophoresis. We found that treatment of HL60 cells with pterostilbene at the IC90 concentration resulted in the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Pterostilbene induced conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to membrane-bound LC3-II and accumulation of large LC3-positive vacuolar structures. Pterostilbene also led to phosphatidylserine externalization, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase activation and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, it did not induce oxidative stress.

METHODS: We conducted a case control study to determine if children born during 1968-1985 to mothers with residential exposure to contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune during pregnancy were more likely to have childhood hematopoietic cancers, neural tube defects (NTDs), or oral clefts. For cancers, exposures during the first year of life were also evaluated. Cases and controls were identified through a survey of parents residing on base during pregnancy and confirmed by medical records. Controls were randomly sampled from surveyed participants who had a live birth without a major birth defect or childhood cancer. Groundwater contaminant fate and transport and distribution system models provided estimates of monthly levels of drinking water contaminants at mothers' residences. Magnitude of odds ratios (ORs) was used to assess associations. Confidence intervals (CIs) were used to indicate precision of ORs. We evaluated parental characteristics and pregnancy history to assess potential confounding. RESULTS: Confounding was negligible so unadjusted results were presented. For NTDs and average 1st trimester exposures, ORs for any benzene exposure and for trichloroethylene above 5 parts per billion were 4.1 (95% CI: 1.4-12.0) and 2.4 (95% CI: 0.6-9.6), respectively. For trichloroethylene, a monotonic exposure response relationship was observed. For childhood cancers and average 1st trimester exposures, ORs for any tetrachloroethylene exposure and any vinyl chloride exposure were 1.6 (95% CI: 0.5-4.8), and 1.6 (95% CI: 0.5-4.7), respectively.

For a better understanding of the effect of XRCC3 Thr241Met (rs861539) polymorphism on leukemia risk, we performed a meta-analysis. All eligible studies were identified through a search of PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) up to August 2013. The association between the XRCC3 Thr241Met (rs861539) polymorphism and leukemia risk was analyzed by means of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Ultimately, seven studies with 1070 cases and 1850 controls were included in the meta-analysis. There was no association between Thr241Met polymorphism and leukemia risk in any of the five models in the overall populations (T vs. C: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 0.95-2.13, p = 0.086; TT vs. CC: OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 0.88-3.33, p = 0.112; TC vs. CC: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.96-1.91, p = 0.089; TT vs. TC/CC: OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 0.87-2.89, p = 0.132; TT/TC vs. CC: OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 0.98-1.94, p = 0.070). In subgroup analysis according to ethnicity, a significant association was found between XRCC3 Thr241Met (rs861539) polymorphism and leukemia risk in Asian but not in Caucasian or mixed populations. In conclusion, the results suggest no association between XRCC3 Thr241Met (rs861539) polymorphism and leukemia risk in the overall populations but a significant association between XRCC3 Thr241Met (rs861539) polymorphism and leukemia risk in the Asian population.

Fifteen patients received pentostatin for SR aGVHD from March 2005 till March 2010 after failure to respond to methylprednisolone >/= 2 mg/kg/d for at least seven d. All patients had grade III-IV aGVHD prior to pentostatin therapy. Thirteen (87%), 10 (67%), and six (40%) patients had gastrointestinal (GI), skin, and liver involvement of aGVHD, respectively. Pentostatin was given at a median of 33 d after steroid therapy initiation. The dose of pentostatin was 1.4 mg/m(2) daily for three d, repeated every two wk. Eight (53%) patients also received additional therapies. Complete responses were noted in two patients (both in skin). However, one patient relapsed and did not respond to additional salvage treatment. Partial responses were seen in three patients. Fourteen died of GVHD-related causes.

Recently, we have demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of a series of naphthalimide derivatives against B16F10 melanoma cells. On the basis of this fact, we have developed a study starting from the synthesis of different cyclic imides and the evaluation of their cytotoxic properties on human acute leukemia cells (K562 and Jurkat). Initially, a screening test was conducted to select the compound with the best cytotoxic effect, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. After this selection, structural modifications were performed in the most active compound to obtain five more derivatives. All compounds presented a good cytotoxic effect. The results of cell cycle analysis, fluorescence microscopy, and Annexin V-FITC assay confirmed that the cells observed in the sub-G0/G1 phase were undergoing apoptosis. From this set of results, cyclic imides 8, 10, and 12 were selected for the evaluation of the mechanisms involved in the apoptotic process. The results demonstrate the involvement of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, evidenced by the reduction in mitochondrial potential, an increase in the level of AIF protein expression, a decreased level of expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, and an increased level of expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in both K562 and Jurkat cells treated with cyclic imides (8, 10, and 12). Furthermore, cyclic imides 8 and 10 caused an increase in the level of Fas expression in Jurkat cells, indicating the additional involvement of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The compounds (8, 10, and 12) also caused a decreased level of expression of anti-apoptotic protein survivin. The biological effects observed with these cyclic imide derivatives in this study suggest promising applications against acute leukemia.","['Machado, Karina Elisa', 'de Oliveira, Kely Navakoski', 'Andreossi, Haira Maria Slobodianuk', 'Bubniak, Lorena Dos Santos', 'de Moraes, Ana Carolina Rabello', 'Gaspar, Pamela Cristina', 'Andrade, Evilasio da Silva', 'Nunes, Ricardo Jose', 'Santos-Silva, Maria Claudia']","['Machado KE', 'de Oliveira KN', 'Andreossi HM', 'Bubniak Ldos S', 'de Moraes AC', 'Gaspar PC', 'Andrade Eda S', 'Nunes RJ', 'Santos-Silva MC']","['Pos-Graduacao em Farmacia Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, UFSC, Campus Trindade, CEP , 88040-900 Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Maleimides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Maleimides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/tx400284r [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2013 Dec 16;26(12):1904-16. doi: 10.1021/tx400284r.

Expression of endometrial receptivity markers including alphavbeta3 integrin, L-selectin, LIF, and pinopods during the implantation window in infertile women stimulated with letrozole or clomiphene citrate (CC), and spontaneous cycles is investigated. A total of 36 women were included in the study out of which 16 women were diagnosed with primary unexplained infertility and the other 20 women with severe oligoasthenozoospermic/azoospermic male partners. Both groups were sub-divided into three groups; women stimulated with letrozole, or with CC, and the third group was allowed to ovulate spontaneously (natural cycles). Women having natural cycles and not given any drug were considered as controls. Once ovulation was confirmed by ultrasonography, endometrial samples were collected on the seventh day post-ovulation and analyzed. In women with unexplained infertility treated with letrozole and CC, epithelial and stromal expression of alphavbeta3 integrin, L-selectin, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and pinopod formation was found to be significantly higher as compared to controls. Expression of these receptivity markers was found to be comparable amongst the letrozole, CC, and control groups in women with severe oligoasthenozoospermic/azoospermic male partners. Cell cycle analysis showed similar cell cycle phase fractions on comparing the CC and the letrozole groups. Stimulation with letrozole and CC appears to enhance endometrial receptivity in women with unexplained infertility. However, letrozole and CC did not have any significant effect on the endometrial receptivity markers of women with severe oligoasthenozoospermic/azoospermic male partners.","['Ganesh, Ashalatha', 'Chauhan, Nageshwar', 'Das, Soumen', 'Chakravarty, Baidyanath', 'Chaudhury, Koel']","['Ganesh A', 'Chauhan N', 'Das S', 'Chakravarty B', 'Chaudhury K']","['Institute of Reproductive Medicine , Salt Lake, Kolkata, West Bengal , India .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131205,England,Syst Biol Reprod Med,Systems biology in reproductive medicine,101464963,"['0 (Aromatase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '1HRS458QU2 (Clomiphene)', '7LKK855W8I (Letrozole)']",IM,"['Aromatase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Clomiphene/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Infertility, Male', 'Letrozole', 'Male', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/11/06 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/19396368.2013.862316 [doi]'],ppublish,Syst Biol Reprod Med. 2014 Apr;60(2):105-11. doi: 10.3109/19396368.2013.862316.

Polymorphism of activating and detoxifying enzymes (CYP, GST, NQO1) may be critical, therefore, in modulating individual susceptibility to benzene. Further uncertainty factors in assessing low level benzene exposure are the limited sensitivity and specificity of most exposure biomarkers, the frequent coexposure to other volatile organic chemicals (VOC), and the presence of non occupational sources of exposure, such as cigarette smoke and veicular traffic. The aim of this presentation is to introduce the main current critical issues in the risk assessment and the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to benzene at low doses.","['Manno, Maurizio']",['Manno M'],"['Sezione di Medicina del lavoro, Dipartimento di Sanita Pubblica, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,G Ital Med Lav Ergon,Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,9712708,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity', 'Chemical Industry', 'Humans', 'Risk Assessment']",,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/12/06 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,G Ital Med Lav Ergon. 2013 Oct-Dec;35(4):247-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Il benzene oggi: da tossico industriale a cancerogeno ambientale.,,,,,

Atypical erosion in the ileum was found on endoscopy. Biopsy of this erosion showed proliferation of cells containing numerous Russell bodies. Differential diagnoses considered were Russell body enteritis, crystal-storing histiocytosis, Mott cell tumor, immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The cells containing prominent Russell bodies showed diffuse positivity for CD79a and CD138, but negative results for CD20, CD3, UCHL-1, CD38 and CD68. Russell bodies were diffusely positive for lambda light chain, but negative for kappa light chain, and immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM. Based on these findings, Russell body enteritis, crystal-storing histiocytosis and IPSID were ruled out. As the tumor formed no mass lesions and was restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, MALT lymphoma with extensive plasma cell differentiation was finally diagnosed. The patient showed an unexpectedly aggressive clinical course. The number of atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood gradually increased and T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) emerged.

Thus, inhibiting P-gp expression might assist in overcoming MDR in cancer chemotherapy. MiRNAome profiling using next-generation sequencing identified differentially expressed microRNAs (miRs) between parental K562 cells and MDR K562 cells (K562/ADM) induced by adriamycin treatment. Two miRs, miR-381 and miR-495, that were strongly down-regulated in K562/ADM cells, are validated to target the 3'-UTR of the MDR1 gene. These miRs are located within a miR cluster located at chromosome region 14q32.31, and all miRs in this cluster appear to be down-regulated in K562/ADM cells. Functional analysis indicated that restoring expression of miR-381 or miR-495 in K562/ADM cells was correlated with reduced expression of the MDR1 gene and its protein product, P-gp, and increased drug uptake by the cells. Thus, we have demonstrated that changing the levels of certain miR species modulates the MDR phenotype in leukemia cells, and propose further exploration of the use of miR-based therapies to overcome MDR.","['Xu, Yan', 'Ohms, Stephen J', 'Li, Zhen', 'Wang, Qiao', 'Gong, Guangming', 'Hu, Yiqiao', 'Mao, Zhiyong', 'Shannon, M Frances', 'Fan, Jun Y']","['Xu Y', 'Ohms SJ', 'Li Z', 'Wang Q', 'Gong G', 'Hu Y', 'Mao Z', 'Shannon MF', 'Fan JY']","[""School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Department of Genome Biology, John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia ; State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131126,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (MIRN381 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN495 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Reproducibility of Results']",PMC3841137,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/10/02 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0082062 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-28953 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 26;8(11):e82062. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0082062. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other studies have also reported the presence of DNA damage during acute oil exposure, but little is known about the long term persistence of chromosomal alterations, which can be considered as a marker of cancer risk. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed whether the breakpoints involved in chromosomal damage can help to assess the risk of cancer as well as to investigate their possible association with DNA repair efficiency. METHODS: Cytogenetic analyses were carried out on the same individuals of our previous study and DNA repair errors were assessed in cultures with aphidicolin. RESULTS: Three chromosomal bands, 2q21, 3q27 and 5q31, were most affected by acute oil exposure. The dysfunction in DNA repair mechanisms, expressed as chromosomal damage, was significantly higher in exposed-oil participants than in those not exposed (p= 0.016). CONCLUSION: The present study shows that breaks in 2q21, 3q27 and 5q31 chromosomal bands, which are commonly involved in hematological cancer, could be considered useful genotoxic oil biomarkers. Moreover, breakages in these bands could induce chromosomal instability, which can explain the increased risk of cancer (leukemia and lymphomas) reported in chronically benzene-exposed individuals. In addition, it has been determined that the individuals who participated in clean-up of the oil spill presented an alteration of their DNA repair mechanisms two years after exposure.","['Monyarch, Gemma', 'de Castro Reis, Fernanda', 'Zock, Jan-Paul', 'Giraldo, Jesus', 'Pozo-Rodriguez, Francisco', 'Espinosa, Ana', 'Rodriguez-Trigo, Gema', 'Verea, Hector', 'Castano-Vinyals, Gemma', 'Gomez, Federico P', 'Anto, Josep M', 'Coll, Maria Dolors', 'Barbera, Joan Albert', 'Fuster, Carme']","['Monyarch G', 'de Castro Reis F', 'Zock JP', 'Giraldo J', 'Pozo-Rodriguez F', 'Espinosa A', 'Rodriguez-Trigo G', 'Verea H', 'Castano-Vinyals G', 'Gomez FP', 'Anto JM', 'Coll MD', 'Barbera JA', 'Fuster C']","['Unitat de Biologia Cel.lular i Genetica Medica, Facultat de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131126,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Fuel Oils)'],IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*drug effects', 'Chromosome Banding', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fuel Oils/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Petroleum Pollution']",PMC3841120,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/10/02 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081276 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-23444 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 26;8(11):e81276. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081276. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have proposed a model previously explaining partly this linkage, in which fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and Wnt signals cooperate to promote NSC self-renewal via beta-catenin accumulation, which leads to the promotion of proliferation by lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated cyclin D1 expression and at the same time to the inhibition of neuronal differentiation by beta-catenin-mediated potentiation of Notch signaling. To fully understand the mechanisms underlying NSC self-renewal, it needs to be clarified how these growth factor signals inhibit glial differentiation as well. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin D1, a NSC growth promoting signaling component and also a common component of FGF2 and Wnt signaling pathways, inhibits astroglial differentiation of NSCs. Interestingly, this effect of cyclin D1 is mediated even though its cell cycle progression activity is blocked. Forced downregulation of cyclin D1 enhances astrogliogenesis of NSCs in culture and in vivo. We further demonstrate that cyclin D1 binds to STAT3, a transcription factor downstream of astrogliogenic cytokines, and suppresses its transcriptional activity on the glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) gene. Taken together with our previous finding, we provide a novel molecular mechanism for NSC self-renewal in which growth promoting signaling components activated by FGF2 and Wnts inhibit neuronal and glial differentiation.","['Bizen, Norihisa', 'Inoue, Toshihiro', 'Shimizu, Takeshi', 'Tabu, Kouichi', 'Kagawa, Tetsushi', 'Taga, Tetsuya']","['Bizen N', 'Inoue T', 'Shimizu T', 'Tabu K', 'Kagawa T', 'Taga T']","['Department of Stem Cell Regulation, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (glial fibrillary astrocytic protein, mouse)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Neural Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Neurogenesis/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'RNA Interference/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,2013/12/05 06:00,2015/01/08 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1613 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2014 Jun;32(6):1602-15. doi: 10.1002/stem.1613.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Astrocyte differentiation', 'Cyclin D1', 'GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway', 'Neural stem cell', 'Self-renewal', 'Transcriptional regulation']",,,,['(c) 2013 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling maintains pluripotency by inducing JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 Y705 (pY705). However, the function of phosphorylated S727 (pS727) in mESCs remains unclear. In this study, we examined the roles of STAT3 pY705 and pS727 in regulating mESC identities, using a small molecule-based system to post-translationally modulate the quantity of transgenic STAT3 in STAT3(-/-) mESCs. We demonstrated that pY705 is absolutely required for STAT3-mediated mESC self-renewal, while pS727 is dispensable, serving only to promote proliferation and optimal pluripotency. S727 phosphorylation is regulated directly by fibroblast growth factor/Erk signaling and crucial in the transition of mESCs from pluripotency to neuronal commitment. Loss of S727 phosphorylation resulted in significantly reduced neuronal differentiation potential, which could be recovered by a S727 phosphorylation mimic. Moreover, loss of pS727 sufficed LIF to reprogram epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency, suggesting a dynamic equilibrium of STAT3 pY705 and pS727 in the control of mESC fate.","['Huang, Guanyi', 'Yan, Hexin', 'Ye, Shoudong', 'Tong, Chang', 'Ying, Qi-Long']","['Huang G', 'Yan H', 'Ye S', 'Tong C', 'Ying QL']","['Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Cell and Neurobiology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '86K0J5AK6M (mirdametinib)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diphenylamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nestin/genetics/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4181708,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1609 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2014 May;32(5):1149-60. doi: 10.1002/stem.1609.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Differentiation', 'Embryonic stem cell', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3', 'Self-renewal']",,['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS630440'],['(c) 2013 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

NPM1, FLT3-ITD, and CEBPA were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 104 weeks (range, 8 to 384), patients in the good risk group (harboring either NPM1 or CEBPA mutation without concurrent FLT3-ITD) showed a borderline worse overall survival (OS) compared with the intermediate/poor risk group (P = 0.08). Interestingly, a poorer OS was found in patients with the CEBPA mutation (P = 0.003) but not the NPM1 mutation (P = 0.96). No OS difference was found between patients with or without FLT3-ITD (P = 0.15). In patients receiving allo-HSCT at first remission, there was no significant OS benefit in the good risk group (P = 0.33). In patients receiving allo-HSCT beyond first remission, disease status played a major role (P = 0.006), irrespective of molecular aberrations. Allo-HSCT in good risk patients should be carefully evaluated in Taiwanese, especially in patients with the CEBPA mutation. Conversely, allo-HSCT should be considered in first remission in patients with an intermediate/poor risk, where it may overcome the adverse impact of FLT3-ITD. Disease status remained a main issue in patients receiving allo-HSCT beyond first remission.","['Liu, Y C', 'Hsiao, H H', 'Lin, P M', 'Yang, W C', 'Chang, C S', 'Liu, T C', 'Hsu, J F', 'Yang, M Y', 'Lin, S F']","['Liu YC', 'Hsiao HH', 'Lin PM', 'Yang WC', 'Chang CS', 'Liu TC', 'Hsu JF', 'Yang MY', 'Lin SF']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131111,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/07/17 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr3142 [pii]', '10.4238/2013.November.11.3 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2013 Nov 11;12(4):5414-23. doi: 10.4238/2013.November.11.3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch inhibition could serve as a new treatment strategy for T-ALL; however, the attempts to perturb Notch signaling pathways have been unsuccessful so far. In this study, we found that proteasome inhibitors exert cytotoxic effects on T-ALL cells with constitutive activation of Notch1 to a similar extent as myeloma cells. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib repressed the transcription of Notch1 and downstream effectors including Hes1, GATA3, RUNX3 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (p65 and p50), coincided with downregulation of the major transactivator Sp1 and its dissociation from Notch1 promoter. Overexpression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) significantly ameliorated bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity against T-ALL cells. Drug combination studies revealed that bortezomib showed synergistic or additive effects with key drugs for the treatment of T-ALL such as dexamethasone (DEX), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, which were readily abolished by NICD overexpression. The synergy of bortezomib and DEX was confirmed in vivo using a murine xenograft model. Our findings provide a molecular basis and rationale for the inclusion of proteasome inhibitors in treatment strategies for T-ALL.","['Koyama, D', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Hiraoka, N', 'Wada, T', 'Kurosawa, H', 'Chiba, S', 'Furukawa, Y']","['Koyama D', 'Kikuchi J', 'Hiraoka N', 'Wada T', 'Kurosawa H', 'Chiba S', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo Medical University, School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131204,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4051216,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013366 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.366 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1216-26. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.366.

Although most cases are accompanied by MLL rearrangements and harbor very few somatic mutations, less is known about the genetics of the cases without MLL translocations. We performed the largest exome-sequencing study to date on matched non-cancer DNA from pairs of mothers and IL patients to characterize congenital variation that may contribute to early leukemogenesis. Using the COSMIC database to define acute leukemia-associated candidate genes, we find a significant enrichment of rare, potentially functional congenital variation in IL patients compared with randomly selected genes within the same patients and unaffected pediatric controls. IL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients had more overall variation than IL acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients, but less of that variation was inherited from mothers. Of our candidate genes, we found that MLL3 was a compound heterozygote in every infant who developed AML and 50% of infants who developed ALL.

In a minority of cases, FA results from biallelic FANCD1/BRCA2 mutations that are associated with early-onset leukaemia and solid tumours. Here, we describe the clinical and molecular features of a remarkable family presenting with multiple primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) without detectable mutations in genes involved in the Mendelian predisposition to CRCs. We unexpectedly identified, despite the absence of clinical cardinal features of FA, a biallelic mutation of the FANCD1/BRCA2 corresponding to a frameshift alteration (c.1845_1846delCT, p.Asn615Lysfs*6) and a missense mutation (c.7802A>G, p.Tyr2601Cys). The diagnosis of FA was confirmed by the chromosomal analysis of lymphocytes. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that the c.7802A>G BRCA2 variation was in fact a splicing mutation that creates an aberrant splicing donor site and results partly into an aberrant transcript encoding a truncated protein (p.Tyr2601Trpfs*46). The atypical FA phenotype observed within this family was probably explained by the residual amount of BRCA2 with the point mutation c.7802A>G in the patients harbouring the biallelic FANCD1/BRCA2 mutations. Although this report is based in a single family, it suggests that CRCs may be part of the tumour spectrum associated with FANCD1/BRCA2 biallelic mutations and that the presence of such mutations should be considered in families with CRCs, even in the absence of cardinal features of FA.","['Degrolard-Courcet, Emilie', 'Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Padeano, Marie-Martine', 'Guiu, Severine', 'Bronner, Myriam', 'Chery, Carole', 'Coron, Fanny', 'Lepage, Come', 'Chapusot, Caroline', 'Loustalot, Catherine', 'Jouve, Jean-Louis', 'Hatem, Cyril', 'Ferrant, Emmanuelle', 'Martin, Laurent', 'Coutant, Charles', 'Baurand, Amandine', 'Couillault, Gerard', 'Delignette, Alexandra', 'El Chehadeh, Salima', 'Lizard, Sarab', 'Arnould, Laurent', 'Fumoleau, Pierre', 'Callier, Patrick', 'Mugneret, Francine', 'Philippe, Christophe', 'Frebourg, Thierry', 'Jonveaux, Philippe', 'Faivre, Laurence']","['Degrolard-Courcet E', 'Sokolowska J', 'Padeano MM', 'Guiu S', 'Bronner M', 'Chery C', 'Coron F', 'Lepage C', 'Chapusot C', 'Loustalot C', 'Jouve JL', 'Hatem C', 'Ferrant E', 'Martin L', 'Coutant C', 'Baurand A', 'Couillault G', 'Delignette A', 'El Chehadeh S', 'Lizard S', 'Arnould L', 'Fumoleau P', 'Callier P', 'Mugneret F', 'Philippe C', 'Frebourg T', 'Jonveaux P', 'Faivre L']","[""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Pole Technique et biologie CHU Dijon, Dijon, France."", 'Laboratoire de Genetique et INSERM U-954, CHU Nancy, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', 'Departement de Chirurgie, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France.', ""Departement d'oncologie medicale, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France."", 'Laboratoire de Genetique et INSERM U-954, CHU Nancy, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', 'Laboratoire de Genetique et INSERM U-954, CHU Nancy, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', ""Centre de Genetique, Hopital d'Enfants, CHU Dijon et Universite de bourgogne, Dijon, France."", 'Service d\' Hepato-gastro-enterologie, CHU ""Bocage Central"", Dijon, France.', ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Pole Technique et biologie CHU Dijon, Dijon, France."", 'Departement de Chirurgie, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France.', 'Service d\' Hepato-gastro-enterologie, CHU ""Bocage Central"", Dijon, France.', 'Hepato-gastro-enterologie, Clinique Drevon, Dijon, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital d'Enfants, CHU Dijon, Dijon, France."", ""Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Pole Technique et biologie CHU Dijon, Dijon, France."", 'Departement de Chirurgie, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France.', ""Centre de Genetique, Hopital d'Enfants, CHU Dijon et Universite de bourgogne, Dijon, France."", ""Service de Pediatrie 1, Hopital d'Enfants, CHU Dijon, Dijon, France."", 'Service de Radiologie, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France.', ""Centre de Genetique, Hopital d'Enfants, CHU Dijon et Universite de bourgogne, Dijon, France."", 'Biologie Moleculaire, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France.', 'Anatomopathologie, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France.', ""Departement d'oncologie medicale, Centre de lutte anti-cancereux Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France."", 'Service de Cytogenetique, Pole Technique et biologie, CHU Dijon, Dijon, France.', 'Service de Cytogenetique, Pole Technique et biologie, CHU Dijon, Dijon, France.', 'Laboratoire de Genetique et INSERM U-954, CHU Nancy, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', 'Inserm U1079 et Departement de Genetique, CHU de Rouen, France.', 'Laboratoire de Genetique et INSERM U-954, CHU Nancy, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', ""Centre de Genetique, Hopital d'Enfants, CHU Dijon et Universite de bourgogne, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20131204,England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Age of Onset', '*Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'BRCA2 Protein/*genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'RNA Splice Sites', 'RNA Splicing']",PMC4350595,2013/12/05 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['ejhg2013278 [pii]', '10.1038/ejhg.2013.278 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2014 Aug;22(8):979-87. doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2013.278.

Here, we evaluated the CD33/CD3-bispecific T cell engaging (BiTE) antibody (AMG 330) for its suitability as a therapeutic agent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We first assessed CD33 expression levels by flow cytometry and found expression in >99% of patient samples (n = 621). CD33 was highest expressed in AMLs with NPM1 mutations (P < .001) and lower in AMLs with complex karyotypes and t(8;21) translocations (P < .001). Furthermore, leukemic stem cells within the CD34(+)/CD38(-) compartment displayed CD33 at higher levels than healthy donor stem cells (P = .047). In MS-5 feeder cell-based long-term cultures that supported the growth of primary AML blasts for up to 36 days, AMG 330 efficiently recruited and expanded residual CD3(+)/CD45RA(-)/CCR7(+) memory T cells within the patient sample. Even at low effector to target ratios, the recruited T cells lysed autologous blasts completely in the majority of samples and substantially in the remaining samples in a time-dependent manner. This study provides the first correlation of CD33 expression levels with AML genotype in a comprehensive analysis of adult patients. Targeting CD33 ex vivo using AMG 330 in primary AML samples led to T cell recruitment and expansion and remarkable antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting efficient therapeutic potential in vivo.","['Krupka, Christina', 'Kufer, Peter', 'Kischel, Roman', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard', 'Bogeholz, Jan', 'Kohnke, Thomas', 'Lichtenegger, Felix S', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Baeuerle, Patrick A', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Riethmuller, Gert', 'Subklewe, Marion']","['Krupka C', 'Kufer P', 'Kischel R', 'Zugmaier G', 'Bogeholz J', 'Kohnke T', 'Lichtenegger FS', 'Schneider S', 'Metzeler KH', 'Fiegl M', 'Spiekermann K', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Hiddemann W', 'Riethmuller G', 'Subklewe M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131203,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36136-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-08-523548 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jan 16;123(3):356-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-08-523548.

Their incidence in persons over age 80 is above 50 new cases per 100,000 persons per year. Their clinical course is highly variable. About one-quarter of all patients with MDS develop acute leukemia. The median survival time from the moment of diagnosis is about 30 months. METHOD: We selectively searched the PubMed database for pertinent articles and guidelines from the years 2000-2013. We used the search term ""myelodysplastic syndromes."" RESULTS: MDS are diagnosed by cytology, with consideration of the degree of dysplasia and the percentage of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow, and on a cytogenetic basis, as recommended in the WHO classification. In particular, chromosomal analysis is necessary for prognostication. The Revised International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS-R) enables more accurate prediction of the course of disease by dividing patients into a number of low- and high-risk groups. The median survival time ranges from a few months to many years. The approved treatments, aside from transfusion therapy, include iron depletion therapy for low-risk patients, lenalidomide for low-risk patients with a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5, and 5-azacytidine for high-risk patients. High-risk patients up to age 70 who have no major accompanying illnesses should be offered allogenic stem-cell transplantation with curative intent. The cure rates range from 30% to 50%. Mucositis, hemorrhages, infections, and graft-versus-host diseases are the most common complications of this form of treatment. CONCLUSION: Myelodysplastic syndromes are treated on an individualized, risk-adapted basis after precise diagnostic evaluation and after assessment of the prognosis. More studies are needed so that stage-adapted treatment can be improved still further.","['Germing, Ulrich', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Gattermann, Norbert']","['Germing U', 'Kobbe G', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Dusseldorf University Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['*Blood Transfusion', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Lenalidomide', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",PMC3855821,2013/12/05 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2013.0783 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2013.0783 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2013 Nov 15;110(46):783-90. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0783.,,,,,,,,,"['Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2014 Feb 14;111(7):118.

Four other AOX1 SNPs were associated with clearance (P=0.01-0.02) in only one of the two cohorts. Our study provides a starting point for future investigations on the functionality of AOX1 SNPs. However, variability in XK469 clearance cannot be attributed to polymorphisms in AOX1.","['Ramirez, Jacqueline', 'Kim, Tae Won', 'Liu, Wanqing', 'Myers, Jamie L', 'Mirkov, Snezana', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Watson, Dorothy', 'Mulkey, Flora', 'Gamazon, Eric R', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Undevia, Samir', 'Innocenti, Federico', 'Ratain, Mark J']","['Ramirez J', 'Kim TW', 'Liu W', 'Myers JL', 'Mirkov S', 'Owzar K', 'Watson D', 'Mulkey F', 'Gamazon ER', 'Stock W', 'Undevia S', 'Innocenti F', 'Ratain MJ']","['aDepartment of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois bDepartment of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (XK 469)', 'EC 1.2.3.1 (AOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.3.1 (Aldehyde Oxidase)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Oxidase/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Quinoxalines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",PMC3901533,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/07/19 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000023 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2014 Feb;24(2):129-32. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000023.,,,,,"['U01 GM061393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA69852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA069852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS542725'],,,,,,,,,,,,

While both DNMT inhibitors induced apoptosis, only azacitidine did so via caspase activation, possibly through its exclusive non-DNA depending effects. We evaluated histone marks for permissive chromatin, H3K4me3, and acetylated histone H4, and for non-permissive chromatin, H3K9me2, and H3K27me3, at the promoter of the IL3 gene, which is under the direct control of AML1/ETO and is critical for myeloid maturation.

Once activated (e.g. by an allergen), they degranulate, a process that results in the exocytosis of allergic mediators. Modulation of mast cell degranulation by drugs and toxicants may have positive or adverse effects on human health. Mast cell function has been dissected in detail with the use of rat basophilic leukemia mast cells (RBL-2H3), a widely accepted model of human mucosal mast cells(3-5). Mast cell granule component and the allergic mediator beta-hexosaminidase, which is released linearly in tandem with histamine from mast cells(6), can easily and reliably be measured through reaction with a fluorogenic substrate, yielding measurable fluorescence intensity in a microplate assay that is amenable to high-throughput studies(1). Originally published by Naal et al.(1), we have adapted this degranulation assay for the screening of drugs and toxicants and demonstrate its use here. Triclosan is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that is present in many consumer products and has been found to be a therapeutic aid in human allergic skin disease(7-11), although the mechanism for this effect is unknown. Here we demonstrate an assay for the effect of triclosan on mast cell degranulation. We recently showed that triclosan strongly affects mast cell function(2). In an effort to avoid use of an organic solvent, triclosan is dissolved directly into aqueous buffer with heat and stirring, and resultant concentration is confirmed using UV-Vis spectrophotometry (using epsilon280 = 4,200 L/M/cm)(12). This protocol has the potential to be used with a variety of chemicals to determine their effects on mast cell degranulation, and more broadly, their allergic potential.","['Weatherly, Lisa M', 'Kennedy, Rachel H', 'Shim, Juyoung', 'Gosse, Julie A']","['Weatherly LM', 'Kennedy RH', 'Shim J', 'Gosse JA']","['Department of Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Maine, Orono.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Video-Audio Media']",20131101,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '0 (Buffers)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '4NM5039Y5X (Triclosan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/pharmacology', 'Buffers', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytological Techniques/instrumentation/methods', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Solubility', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Triclosan/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Water/chemistry']",PMC3969050,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/06/26 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/50671 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2013 Nov 1;(81):e50671. doi: 10.3791/50671.,,,,,"['P20 GM103423/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20-GM103423/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It often results in a fatal outcome mainly due to the difficulty of early diagnosis and its resistance to antimycotics. CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Following the induction chemotherapy he developed febrile neutropenia. Meropenem (3x1000mg/day) was introduced empirically. A chest computed tomography showed soft-tissue consolidation change in his right upper lobe. A bronchoscopy was performed and the histology indicated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis based on fungal hypha detection. Also, high risk patients are routinely screened for invasive fungal infections using commercially available serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests: galactomannan and mannan (Bio-Rad, France), as well as anti-Aspergillus immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin M and anti-Candida immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin M antibodies (Virion-Serion, Germany). Galactomannan showed low positivity and voriconazole therapy (2x400mg/first day; 2x300mg/following days) was implemented. The patient became afebrile and a partial remission of disease was established. After 2 months, the patient developed a fever and a chest multi-slice computed tomography showed soft-tissue mass compressing his upper right bronchus. Voriconazole (2x400mg/first day; 2x300mg/following days) was reintroduced and bronchoscopy was repeated. Histologic examination of the new specimen was done, as well as a revision of the earlier samples in the reference laboratory and the diagnosis was switched to invasive pulmonary mucormycosis. The treatment was changed to amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (1x400mg/day). The complete remission of acute myeloblastic leukemia was verified after 2 months. During his immunerestitution, a high positivity of the anti-Aspergillus immunoglobulin M antibodies was found in a single serum sample and pulmonary radiography was unchanged. A lobectomy of his right upper pulmonary lobe was done and the mycology culture of the lung tissue sample revealed Rhizopus oryzae. He remained in complete remission for more than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive mucormycosis was successfully treated with amphotericin B, surgery and secondary itraconazole prophylaxis. As a rare disease invasive mucormycosis is not well understood by the medical community and therefore an improvement of education about prevention, diagnosis and treatment of invasive mucormycosis is necessary.","['Vidovic, Ana', 'Arsic-Arsenijevic, Valentina', 'Tomin, Dragica', 'Djunic, Irena', 'Jakovic, Radoslav', 'Loncar, Zlatibor', 'Barac, Aleksandra']","['Vidovic A', 'Arsic-Arsenijevic V', 'Tomin D', 'Djunic I', 'Jakovic R', 'Loncar Z', 'Barac A']","['Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine University of Belgrade, Dr Subotica 1, Belgrade, Serbia. mikomedlab2011@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131203,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC3879024,2013/12/05 06:00,2013/12/05 06:01,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/05 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-7-263 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-7-263 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2013 Dec 3;7:263. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-7-263.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not ERK1/2 pathway is involved in antitumor effects of TRAIL on gastric cancer cells. In addition to activate the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway, TRAIL also triggered the activation of ERK1/2. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling by MEK inhibitor U0126 promoted cell death via increased activation of caspases, drop in mitochondrial membrane potential and downregulation of XIAP, cIAP2 and Mcl-1. These results indicate that TRAIL-induced rapid activation of ERK1/2 may be a survival mechanism to struggle against TRAIL assault at the early stage, and inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling can sensitize gastric cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","['Wu, P', 'Cheng, Y W', 'Wang, J Y', 'Zhang, X D', 'Zhang, L J']","['Wu P', 'Cheng YW', 'Wang JY', 'Zhang XD', 'Zhang LJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2014_019 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2014;61(2):136-43. doi: 10.4149/neo_2014_019.,,['NOTNLM'],"['gastric cancer, TRAIL, ERK1/2, apoptosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of methods for MRD detection has revolutionized monitoring of treatment response in acute leukemia. Great progress has been made in the development of wide array of flow cytometric techniques for rare event detection. This advance was accompanied by increasingly greater understanding of the immunophenotypic features of leukemic and normal lymphoid cells, and of the antigenic differences that make MRD studies possible. Immunologic testing of MRD relies on ""leukemia-associated"" immunophenotypes which can be identified by MFC in the most of acute leukemia cases. The recent technical innovations in routine MFC (3 lasers and>/=8 colors) and the new developments in software for data analysis make this technology the most attractive for MRD diagnostics. The importance of MFC methodology will be further strengthened by the ongoing international standardization efforts. Results of MRD testing provide unique and clinically important information. The systematic application of immunologic techniques to study MRD in clinical samples has demonstrated the prognostic significance of MRD in patients, leading to the use of MRD to regulate treatment intensity in many contemporary protocols. The identification of new markers of MRD should increase the sensitivity of MRD testing by MFC and is required to widen the applicability of MRD studies.","['Kusenda, J', 'Fajtova, M', 'Kovarikova, A']","['Kusenda J', 'Fajtova M', 'Kovarikova A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Software']",,2013/12/05 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/12/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2014_017 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2014;61(2):119-27. doi: 10.4149/neo_2014_017.,,['NOTNLM'],"['minimal residual disease, acute leukemia, multiparameter flow cytometry,', 'prognostic factors, remission.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Diagnostic/therapeutic accidents. BACKGROUND: Bone marrow (BM) trephine biopsy is generally a safe procedure, but adverse events such as retroperitoneal hemorrhage (RPH) may occur. We report 3 cases of this complication. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old male with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy underwent BM trephine biopsy to confirm relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two hours later, he developed severe hypotension and a CT scan revealed a massive RPH, and was treated conservatively. The RPH recurred 2 weeks after chemotherapy and was successfully treated with gel foam embolization. A 55-year-old male with coagulopathy underwent BM trephine biopsy for hyperleukocytosis and thrombocytosis. He developed a large RPH preceded by left lumbar dermatome sensory neuropathy. He was treated conservatively. A 56-year-old overweight woman on aspirin underwent BM trephine biopsy for polycythemia. Twelve hours later she developed severe abdominal pain with hypotension. A CT scan showed a massive RPH and secondary hemothorax. She was treated conservatively and the RPH resolved after several months. CONCLUSIONS: We and others showed that myeloproliferative neoplasm, quantitative or qualitative platelet abnormalities, aspirin, coagulopathy, and obesity are associated with development of RPH following BM trephine biopsy. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial. Correction of coagulopathy and cessation of anti-platelet treatment prior to biopsy can prevent this serious complication.","['Wan Jamaludin, Wan Fariza', 'Mohamed Mukari, Shahizon Azura', 'Abdul Wahid, S Fadilah']","['Wan Jamaludin WF', 'Mohamed Mukari SA', 'Abdul Wahid SF']","['Cell Therapy Centre and Department of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), Jalan Yaacob Latif, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131120,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,,,PMC3843570,2013/12/04 06:00,2013/12/04 06:01,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12659/AJCR.889274 [doi]', '889274 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2013 Nov 20;14:489-93. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.889274. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Retroperitoneal hematoma', 'bone marrow trephine biopsy', 'retroperitoneal hemorrhage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the Ikaros transcription factor is required for the differentiation of large pre-B to small pre-B cells. Mice deleted for Ikaros in pro/pre-B cells show a complete block of differentiation at the fraction C' stage, and Ikaros-null pre-B cells cannot differentiate upon withdrawal of IL-7 in vitro. Restoration of Ikaros function rescues pre-B cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo and depends on DNA binding. Ikaros is required for the down-regulation of the pre-BCR, Igkappa germline transcription, and Ig L chain recombination. Furthermore, Ikaros antagonizes the IL-7-dependent regulation of >3,000 genes, many of which are up- or down-regulated between fractions C' and D. Affected genes include those important for survival, metabolism, B cell signaling, and function, as well as transcriptional regulators like Ebf1, Pax5, and the Foxo1 family. Our data thus identify Ikaros as a central regulator of IL-7 signaling and pre-B cell development.","['Heizmann, Beate', 'Kastner, Philippe', 'Chan, Susan']","['Heizmann B', 'Kastner P', 'Chan S']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U964, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131202,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', 'Interleukin-7/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome', 'VDJ Recombinases/metabolism']",PMC3865471,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20131735 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20131735 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2013 Dec 16;210(13):2823-32. doi: 10.1084/jem.20131735.

We described a deletion of a Gata2 cis-element (+9.5) that depletes fetal liver HSCs, is lethal at E13-14 of embryogenesis, and is mutated in an immunodeficiency that progresses to myelodysplasia/leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that the +9.5 element enhances Gata2 expression and is required to generate long-term repopulating HSCs in the AGM. Deletion of the +9.5 element abrogated the capacity of hemogenic endothelium to generate HSC-containing clusters in the aorta. Genomic analyses indicated that the +9.5 element regulated a rich ensemble of genes that control hemogenic endothelium and HSCs, as well as genes not implicated in hematopoiesis. These results reveal a mechanism that controls stem cell emergence from hemogenic endothelium to establish the adult hematopoietic system.","['Gao, Xin', 'Johnson, Kirby D', 'Chang, Yuan-I', 'Boyer, Meghan E', 'Dewey, Colin N', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Gao X', 'Johnson KD', 'Chang YI', 'Boyer ME', 'Dewey CN', 'Zhang J', 'Bresnick EH']","['Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Carbone Cancer Center, and 2 McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, 3 UW-Madison Blood Research Program; and 4 Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131202,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/embryology', 'Cell Separation', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genomics', 'Gonads/embryology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Male', 'Mesonephros/embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Stem Cells/cytology']",PMC3865483,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20130733 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20130733 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2013 Dec 16;210(13):2833-42. doi: 10.1084/jem.20130733.

It is unclear how many patients achieve MR(4.5) under different treatment modalities and whether MR(4.5) predicts survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from the randomized CML-Study IV were analyzed for confirmed MR(4.5) which was defined as >/= 4.5 log reduction of BCR-ABL on the international scale (IS) and determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in two consecutive analyses. Landmark analyses were performed to assess the impact of MR(4.5) on survival. RESULTS: Of 1,551 randomly assigned patients, 1,524 were assessable. After a median observation time of 67.5 months, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 90%, 5-year progression-free-survival was 87.5%, and 8-year OS was 86%. The cumulative incidence of MR(4.5) after 9 years was 70% (median, 4.9 years); confirmed MR(4.5) was 54%. MR(4.5) was reached more quickly with optimized high-dose imatinib than with imatinib 400 mg/day (P = .016). Independent of treatment approach, confirmed MR(4.5) at 4 years predicted significantly higher survival probabilities than 0.1% to 1% IS, which corresponds to complete cytogenetic remission (8-year OS, 92% v 83%; P = .047). High-dose imatinib and early major molecular remission predicted MR(4.5). No patient with confirmed MR(4.5) has experienced progression. CONCLUSION: MR(4.5) is a new molecular predictor of long-term outcome, is reached by a majority of patients treated with imatinib, and is achieved more quickly with optimized high-dose imatinib, which may provide an improved therapeutic basis for treatment discontinuation in CML.","['Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Lauseker, Michael', 'Hanfstein, Benjamin', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Schreiber, Annette', 'Proetel, Ulrike', 'Pletsch, Nadine', 'Pfirrmann, Markus', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Dengler, Jolanta', 'Falge, Christiane', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Stegelmann, Frank', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Waller, Cornelius F', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Baerlocher, Gabriela M', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Heimpel, Hermann', 'Nerl, Christoph', 'Krause, Stefan W', 'Hossfeld, Dieter K', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Hehlmann R', 'Muller MC', 'Lauseker M', 'Hanfstein B', 'Fabarius A', 'Schreiber A', 'Proetel U', 'Pletsch N', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Haferlach C', 'Schnittger S', 'Einsele H', 'Dengler J', 'Falge C', 'Kanz L', 'Neubauer A', 'Kneba M', 'Stegelmann F', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Waller CF', 'Spiekermann K', 'Baerlocher GM', 'Ehninger G', 'Heim D', 'Heimpel H', 'Nerl C', 'Krause SW', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Kolb HJ', 'Hasford J', 'Saussele S', 'Hochhaus A']","['Rudiger Hehlmann, Martin C.

Most centers use 7 to 10 days of cytarabine at a daily dose of 100 to 200 mg/m(2) for remission induction. Consensus has not been reached on the benefit of higher dosages of cytarabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell' Adulto (GIMEMA) Leukemia Groups conducted a randomized trial (AML-12; Combination Chemotherapy, Stem Cell Transplant and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia) in 1,942 newly diagnosed patients with AML, age 15 to 60 years, comparing remission induction treatment containing daunorubicin, etoposide, and either standard-dose (SD) cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day by continuous infusion for 10 days) or high-dose (HD) cytarabine (3,000 mg/m(2) every 12 hours by 3-hour infusion on days 1, 3, 5, and 7). Patients in complete remission (CR) received a single consolidation cycle containing daunorubicin and intermediate-dose cytarabine (500 mg/m(2) every 12 hours for 6 days). Subsequently, a stem-cell transplantation was planned. The primary end point was survival. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 6 years, overall survival was 38.7% for patients randomly assigned to SD cytarabine and 42.5% for those randomly assigned to HD cytarabine (log-rank test P = .06; multivariable analysis P = .009). For patients younger than age 46 years, survival was 43.3% and 51.9%, respectively (P = .009; multivariable analysis P = .003), and for patients age 46 to 60 years, survival was 33.9% and 32.9%, respectively (P = .91).

As a consequence, Lnk(-/-) mice develop hematopoietic hyperplasia, which progresses to a phenotype resembling the nonacute phase of myeloproliferative neoplasm. In addition, Lnk mutations have been identified in human myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute leukemia. We find that Lnk suppresses the development of radiation-induced acute B-cell malignancies in mice. Lnk-deficient HSPCs recover more effectively from irradiation than their wild-type counterparts, and this resistance of Lnk(-/-) HSPCs to radiation underlies the subsequent emergence of leukemia. A search for the mechanism responsible for radiation resistance identified the cytokine IL-11 as being critical for the ability of Lnk(-/-) HSPCs to recover from irradiation and subsequently become leukemic. In IL-11 signaling, wild-type Lnk suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of the Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2/protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 11 and its association with the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, as well as activation of the Erk MAP kinase pathway. Indeed, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 has a binding motif for the Lnk Src Homology 2 domain that is phosphorylated in response to IL-11 stimulation. IL-11 therefore drives a pathway that enhances HSPC radioresistance and radiation-induced B-cell malignancies, but is normally attenuated by the inhibitory adaptor Lnk.","['Louria-Hayon, Igal', 'Frelin, Catherine', 'Ruston, Julie', 'Gish, Gerald', 'Jin, Jing', 'Kofler, Michael M', 'Lambert, Jean-Philippe', 'Adissu, Hibret A', 'Milyavsky, Michael', 'Herrington, Robert', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Dick, John E', 'Gingras, Anne-Claude', 'Iscove, Norman N', 'Pawson, Tony']","['Louria-Hayon I', 'Frelin C', 'Ruston J', 'Gish G', 'Jin J', 'Kofler MM', 'Lambert JP', 'Adissu HA', 'Milyavsky M', 'Herrington R', 'Minden MD', 'Dick JE', 'Gingras AC', 'Iscove NN', 'Pawson T']","['Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131202,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (IL11 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lnk protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/genetics/*radiation effects']",PMC3870688,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1319665110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1319665110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Dec 17;110(51):20599-604. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1319665110.

We have found that activated Akt enhances rRNA synthesis through the phosphorylation of casein kinase IIalpha (CK2alpha) on a threonine residue near its N terminus. CK2 in turn phosphorylates TIF-IA, thereby increasing rDNA transcription. Activated Akt also stabilizes TIF-IA, induces its translocation to the nucleolus, and enhances its interaction with Pol I. Treatment with AZD8055, an inhibitor of both Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation, but not with rapamycin, disrupts Akt-mediated TIF-IA stability, translocation, and activity. These data support a model in which activated Akt enhances rRNA synthesis both by preventing TIF-IA degradation and phosphorylating CK2alpha, which in turn phosphorylates TIF-IA. This model provides an explanation for the ability of activated Akt to promote cell proliferation and, potentially, transformation.","['Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong', 'Mitchell, Beverly S']","['Nguyen le XT', 'Mitchell BS']","['Department of Medicine and Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131202,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RRN3 protein, human)', '0 (Rrn3 protein, mouse)', '970JJ37FPW', '((5-(2,4-bis((3S)-3-methylmorpholin-4-yl)pyrido(2,3-d)pyrimidin-7-yl)-2-methoxyph', 'enyl)methanol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CSNK2A1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Casein Kinase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Ribosomal/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase I/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",PMC3870716,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1313097110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1313097110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Dec 17;110(51):20681-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1313097110.

As TNF is present at high levels in AML and TNF receptor-2 (TNFR2)-expressing Tregs identify highly functional Tregs, we examine the hypothesis that TNFR2(+) Tregs are a relevant Treg subset in this cancer. We also determine the effect of the novel combinatorial therapy of the demethylating agent, azacitidine with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat on Tregs, particularly TNFR2(+) Tregs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty healthy donors and 14 patients with AML were enrolled in this study. Patients were treated with azacitidine and panobinostat for 28-day cycles. The frequency and functional relevance of TNFR2(+) Tregs were analyzed subsequently. RESULTS: We report that TNFR2(+) Tregs are increased in AML and have a high migration potential toward the bone marrow. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the level of TNFR2(+) Tregs in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of patients are decreased in vivo after exposure to panobinostat and azacitidine. Reductions in TNFR2(+) Tregs were associated with increases in Interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 production by effector T cells within the bone marrow and beneficial clinical responses. In vitro mechanistic studies indicated panobinostat as the primary driver for the reduction of Tregs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides for the first time, in vivo validation of the ability of panobinostat in combination with azacitidine to suppress prevalent TNFR2(+) Tregs, resulting in clinical benefits within patients with AML.","['Govindaraj, Chindu', 'Tan, Peter', 'Walker, Patricia', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Plebanski, Magdalena']","['Govindaraj C', 'Tan P', 'Walker P', 'Wei A', 'Spencer A', 'Plebanski M']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School; and Department of Clinical Hematology, The Alfred Hospital, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131202,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Indoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Panobinostat', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1576 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1576 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Feb 1;20(3):724-35. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1576.

Since the early 20th century it is well known that using ionizing radiation in diagnostic procedures causes cancer - physicians themselves frequently being struck by this disease in those early days of radiology. Radiation protection therefore plays an important role. Below doses of 100 Millisievert (mSv) however much research has to be accomplished yet because not only malignant tumors, but cardiovascular diseases, malformations and genetic sequelae attributable to low dose radiation have been described. Unborns, children and adolescents are highly vulnerable. Dose response correlations are subject to continuing discussions because data stem mostly from calculations studying Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Radiation exposure is not exactly known, and it is unknown, if observations of radiation induced diseases in this ethnicity can be generalized. Nowadays the main source of low dose ionizing radiation from medical diagnostics is due to computertomography (CT). Large recent clinical studies from the UK and Australia investigating cancer incidence after exposition to CT in childhood and adolescence confirm that low doses in the range of 5 mSv already significantly increase the risk of malignant diseases during follow up. Imaging techniques as ultrasound and magnetic resonance tomography therefore should be preferred whenever appropriate.","['Knusli, Claudio', 'Walter, Martin']","['Knusli C', 'Walter M']",['Physicians for Social Responsibility/International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War Schweiz.'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

Average ELF-MF exposure is mainly determined by high voltage power lines and transformers at home or at the workplace, whereas RF-EMF exposure is mainly caused by devices operating close to the body (mainly mobile and cordless phones). Health effects of EMF are controversially discussed. The IARC classified ELF-MF and RF-EMF as possible carcinogenic. Most consistent epidemiological evidence was found for an association between ELF-MF and childhood leukaemia. If causal, 1 - 4 percent of all childhood leukaemia cases could be attributed to ELF-MF. Epidemiological research provided some indications for an association between ELF-MF and Alzheimer's diseases as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although not entirely consistent. Regarding mobile phones and brain tumours, some studies observed an increased risk after heavy or long term use on the one hand. On the other hand, brain tumour incidence was not found to have increased in the last decade in Sweden, England or the US. Acute effects of RF-EMF on non-specific symptoms of ill health seem unlikely according to randomized and double blind provocation studies. However, epidemiological research on long term effects is still limited. Although from the current state of the scientific knowledge a large individual health risk from RF-EMF exposure is unlikely, even a small risk would have substantial public health relevance because of the widespread use of wireless communication technologies.","['Roosli, Martin']",['Roosli M'],"['Schweizerisches Tropen- und Public Health-Institut, Basel.']",['ger'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

Our goal was to investigate P-gp transport of paraquat, a Parkinson-associated neurotoxicant. We used in vitro transport models of ATPase activity, xenobiotic-induced cytotoxicity, transepithelial permeability, and rhodamine-123 inhibition. We also measured paraquat pharmacokinetics and brain distribution in Friend leukemia virus B-type (FVB) wild-type and P-gp-deficient (mdr1a(-/-)/mdr1b(-/-)) mice following 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg oral doses. In vitro data showed that: 1) paraquat failed to stimulate ATPase activity; 2) resistance to paraquat-induced cytotoxicity was unchanged in P-gp-expressing cells in the absence or presence of P-gp inhibitors GF120918 [N-(4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)ethyl]-phenyl)-9,10-di hydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridine carboxamide] and verapamil-37.0 [95% confidence interval (CI): 33.2-41.4], 46.2 (42.5-50.2), and 34.1 microM (31.2-37.2)-respectively; 3) transepithelial permeability ratios of paraquat were the same in P-gp-expressing and nonexpressing cells (1.55 +/- 0.39 and 1.39 +/- 0.43, respectively); and 4) paraquat did not inhibit rhodamine-123 transport. Population pharmacokinetic modeling revealed minor differences between FVB wild-type and mdr1a(-/-)/mdr1b(-/-) mice: clearances of 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-0.52] and 0.78 l/h (0.58-0.98), respectively, and volume of distributions of 1.77 (95% CI: 1.50-2.04) and 3.36 liters (2.39-4.33), respectively; however, the change in clearance was in the opposite direction of what would be expected.

We noticed a lack of substitutions involving 4 amino acids (E286, M318, I360, and D381) that form hydrogen bonds with ponatinib. We therefore introduced mutations in each of these residues, either preserving or altering their physicochemical properties. We found that E286, M318, I360, and D381 are dispensable for ABL and BCR-ABL protein stability but are critical for preserving catalytic activity. Indeed, only a ""conservative"" I360T substitution retained kinase proficiency and transforming potential. Molecular dynamics simulations of BCR-ABL(I360T) revealed differences in both helix alphaC dynamics and protein-correlated motions, consistent with a modified ATP-binding pocket. Nevertheless, this mutant remained sensitive to ponatinib, imatinib, and dasatinib. These results suggest that changes in the 4 BCR-ABL residues described here would be selected against by a lack of kinase activity or by maintained responsiveness to TKIs. Notably, amino acids equivalent to those identified in BCR-ABL are conserved in 51% of human tyrosine kinases. Hence, these residues may represent an appealing target for the design of pharmacological compounds that would inhibit additional oncogenic tyrosine kinases while avoiding the emergence of resistance due to point mutations.","['Buffa, Pietro', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Pandini, Alessandro', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Fraternali, Franca', 'Vigneri, Paolo G']","['Buffa P', 'Romano C', 'Pandini A', 'Massimino M', 'Tirro E', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Manzella L', 'Fraternali F', 'Vigneri PG']","['2P.G.V., Department of Clinical and Molecular Biomedicine, University of Catania, Via Androne, 85, 95124 Catania, Italy. pvigneri@libero.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131202,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biocatalysis', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*metabolism', 'Pyridazines/*metabolism']",,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.13-236992 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.13-236992 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2014 Mar;28(3):1221-36. doi: 10.1096/fj.13-236992.

More automated methods are needed for determining these ""driver"" mutations in each individual patient. For this purpose, we are exploiting two types of contextual information: (1) the pp interactions of the mutated genes, as well as (2) their potential correlations with gene expression clusters.

However, it occurs at varying times and in a limited subset of patients. To identify early clinical markers for favorable responses applicable to all patients with or without lymphocytosis, we prospectively analyzed lymphocyte profiles of 50 Japanese CML patients treated with dasatinib after intolerance/resistance to imatinib. Although absolute lymphocyte counts did not differ significantly until 3 months between patients with complete molecular response (CMR) at 12 months and those without it, relative increases in lymphocyte compared with baselines differed significantly from 1 month. Patients with relative lymphocyte counts >150 % at 1 month or >200 % at 3 months had higher CMR rates at 12 months than others (57.9 vs. 23.3 %, P = 0.015, and 76.5 vs. 16.1 %, P < 0.0001, respectively). A relative increase in lymphocyte subset of CD57(+)CD14(-), CD8(+)T, or NK cells >200 % at 1 month was also significantly associated with a higher CMR rate. There were significant negative correlations between relative lymphocyte increases and BCR/ABL transcript levels. CD57(+)CD14(-) cells were a highly specific focus of proliferation. Relative increases in lymphocyte count and its subsets from 1 month are reliable early markers of favorable responses to dasatinib.","['Kumagai, Takashi', 'Matsuki, Eri', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Shinagawa, Atsushi', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Wakita, Hisashi', 'Kozai, Yasuji', 'Shirasugi, Yukari', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Iwase, Osamu', 'Yano, Shingo', 'Nishiwaki, Kaichi', 'Oba, Koji', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi']","['Kumagai T', 'Matsuki E', 'Inokuchi K', 'Ohashi K', 'Shinagawa A', 'Takeuchi J', 'Yoshida C', 'Okamoto S', 'Wakita H', 'Kozai Y', 'Shirasugi Y', 'Fujisawa S', 'Iwase O', 'Yano S', 'Nishiwaki K', 'Oba K', 'Sakamoto J', 'Sakamaki H']","['Department of Hematology, Ohme Municipal General Hospital, 4-16-5 Higashi-Ohme, Ohme, Tokyo, 198-0042, Japan, kumamed1_2001@yahoo.co.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131203,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/07/19 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1483-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Jan;99(1):41-52. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1483-9.

Our previous in vitro studies demonstrated that valproic acid (VPA) exerted antitumor effects on Kasumi1 cells, which are human acute myeloid leukemia cells with an 8;21 chromosome translocation. In the present study, the effects of VPA on tumor angiogenesis were investigated in mice transplanted with Kasumi1 cells. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor (VEGFR2) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The tumor microvessel density was measured following staining with an antiCD34 antibody. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to study the effect of VPAinduced histone hyperacetylation on VEGF transcription. An intraperitoneal injection of VPA inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice transplanted with Kasumi1 cells. The mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, VEGFR2 and bFGF were inhibited by VPA treatment. In addition, VPA downregulated HDAC, increased histone H3 acetylation and enhanced the accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H3 on the VEGF promoters. The findings of the present study indicate that VPA, an HDAC inhibitor, exerts an antileukemic effect through an antiangiogenesis mechanism. In conclusion, the mechanism underlying VPAinduced antiangiogenesis is associated with the suppression of angiogenic factors and their receptors. VPA may increase the accumulation of acetylated histones on the VEGF promoters, which possibly contributes to the regulation of angiogenic factors.","['Zhang, Zhi-Hua', 'Hao, Chang-Lai', 'Liu, Peng', 'Tian, Xia', 'Wang, Li-Hong', 'Zhao, Lei', 'Zhu, Cui-Min']","['Zhang ZH', 'Hao CL', 'Liu P', 'Tian X', 'Wang LH', 'Zhao L', 'Zhu CM']","['Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, Hebei 067000, P.R.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of EcA is limited due to immunogenicity and a short half-life in the patient. Here, we performed rational mutagenesis to obtain EcA variants with a potential to improve ALL treatment. Several variants, especially W66Y and Y176F, killed the ALL cells more efficiently than did wild-type EcA (WT-EcA), although nonleukemic peripheral blood monocytes were not affected. Several assays, including Western blotting, annexin-V/propidium iodide binding, comet, and micronuclei assays, showed that the reduction in viability of leukemic cells is due to the increase in caspase-3, cytochrome c release, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, an arrest of the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and eventually apoptosis. Both W66Y and Y176F induced significantly more apoptosis in lymphocytes derived from ALL patients. In addition, Y176F and Y176S exhibited greatly decreased glutaminase activity, whereas K288S/Y176F, a variant mutated in one of the immunodominant epitopes, showed reduced antigenicity. Further in vivo immunogenicity studies in mice showed that K288S/Y176F was 10-fold less immunogenic as compared with WT-EcA. Moreover, sera obtained from WT-EcA immunized mice and ALL patients who were given asparaginase therapy for several weeks recognized the K288S/Y176F mutant significantly less than the WT-EcA. Further mechanistic studies revealed that W66Y, Y176F, and K288S/Y176F rapidly depleted asparagine and also down-regulated the transcription of asparagine synthetase as compared with WT-EcA. These highly desirable attributes of these variants could significantly advance asparaginase therapy of leukemia in the future.","['Mehta, Ranjit Kumar', 'Verma, Shikha', 'Pati, Rashmirekha', 'Sengupta, Mitali', 'Khatua, Biswajit', 'Jena, Rabindra Kumar', 'Sethy, Sudha', 'Kar, Santosh K', 'Mandal, Chitra', 'Roehm, Klaus H', 'Sonawane, Avinash']","['Mehta RK', 'Verma S', 'Pati R', 'Sengupta M', 'Khatua B', 'Jena RK', 'Sethy S', 'Kar SK', 'Mandal C', 'Roehm KH', 'Sonawane A']","['From the School of Biotechnology, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha 751024, India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131202,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/pharmacology', '*Asparaginase/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/genetics/immunology/metabolism', '*Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', '*Escherichia coli Proteins/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutagenesis', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",PMC3916557,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)74746-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.486530 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Feb 7;289(6):3555-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.486530.

Results confirmed that SMZL is an entity distinct from other low-grade B-cell lymphomas, and identified mutations in multiple genes involved in marginal zone development, and others involved in NF-kappaB, BCR, chromatin remodelling and the cytoskeleton.","['Martinez, N', 'Almaraz, C', 'Vaque, J P', 'Varela, I', 'Derdak, S', 'Beltran, S', 'Mollejo, M', 'Campos-Martin, Y', 'Agueda, L', 'Rinaldi, A', 'Kwee, I', 'Gut, M', 'Blanc, J', 'Oscier, D', 'Strefford, J C', 'Martinez-Lopez, J', 'Salar, A', 'Sole, F', 'Rodriguez-Peralto, J L', 'Diez-Tascon, C', 'Garcia, J F', 'Fraga, M', 'Sebastian, E', 'Alves, J', 'Menarguez, J', 'Gonzalez-Carrero, J', 'Casado, L F', 'Bayes, M', 'Bertoni, F', 'Gut, I', 'Piris, M A']","['Martinez N', 'Almaraz C', 'Vaque JP', 'Varela I', 'Derdak S', 'Beltran S', 'Mollejo M', 'Campos-Martin Y', 'Agueda L', 'Rinaldi A', 'Kwee I', 'Gut M', 'Blanc J', 'Oscier D', 'Strefford JC', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Salar A', 'Sole F', 'Rodriguez-Peralto JL', 'Diez-Tascon C', 'Garcia JF', 'Fraga M', 'Sebastian E', 'Alves J', 'Menarguez J', 'Gonzalez-Carrero J', 'Casado LF', 'Bayes M', 'Bertoni F', 'Gut I', 'Piris MA']","['Cancer Genomics, IFIMAV Instituto de Formacion e Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics, IFIMAV Instituto de Formacion e Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics, IFIMAV Instituto de Formacion e Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'IBBTEC, UC-CSIC-SODERCAN, Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.', 'CNAG Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CNAG Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'CNAG Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research and Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', '1] Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research and Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland [2] Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA), Manno, Switzerland [3] SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'CNAG Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CNAG Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Genomics, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, Hospital del Mar and Institut Josep Carreras (IJC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Dermatology Service, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital de Leon, Leon, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Santiago, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Clinico de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, HGUGM, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Xeral Cies, Vigo, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'CNAG Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research and Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland [2] Lymphoma Unit, IOSI Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'CNAG Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Cancer Genomics, IFIMAV Instituto de Formacion e Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain [2] Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131203,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Exome/*genetics', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology']",,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013365 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.365 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1334-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.365.

Far more tightly regulated than size is density, the ratio between mass and volume, which can be used to distinguish between cell populations even when volume and mass appear to remain constant. Here we expand upon a previous method for measuring cell density involving a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR). We introduce a new device, the dual SMR, as a high-precision instrument for measuring single-cell mass, volume, and density using two resonators connected by a serpentine fluidic channel. The dual SMR designs considered herein demonstrate the critical role of channel geometry in ensuring proper mixing and damping of pressure fluctuations in microfluidic systems designed for precision measurement. We use the dual SMR to compare the physical properties of two well-known cancer cell lines: human lung cancer cell H1650 and mouse lymphoblastic leukemia cell line L1210.","['Bryan, Andrea K', 'Hecht, Vivian C', 'Shen, Wenjiang', 'Payer, Kristofor', 'Grover, William H', 'Manalis, Scott R']","['Bryan AK', 'Hecht VC', 'Shen W', 'Payer K', 'Grover WH', 'Manalis SR']","['Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. scottm@media.mit.edu; ; Tel: +1-617-253-5039.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. scottm@media.mit.edu; ; Tel: +1-617-253-5039.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Innovative Micro Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, 93117, USA.', 'Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. scottm@media.mit.edu; ; Tel: +1-617-253-5039.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. scottm@media.mit.edu; ; Tel: +1-617-253-5039.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['65455-52-9 (Percoll)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Size', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Povidone/chemistry', 'Silicon Dioxide/chemistry']",PMC3895367,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/08/16 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c3lc51022k [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2014 Feb 7;14(3):569-576. doi: 10.1039/c3lc51022k.,,,,,"['P30 CA014051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM085457/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM085457/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA143874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50GM68762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM068762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS545583'],,,,,,,,,,,,

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 17-year-old boy was hospitalized for receiving acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment that was composed of vincristine, L-asparaginase, daunorubicin, and prednisone. Hyperglycemia was determined without any clinical sign and metformin was started for steroid-induced insulin resistance. On the second day of metformin treatment, the patient's hemoglobin level decreased, and a direct Coombs test was positive for immunoglobulin G but negative for complement. An indirect Coombs test was negative. The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase level was within the normal range. Drug-induced hemolytic anemia was suspected and metformin was discontinued. The jaundice gradually disappeared and there was no requirement for red blood cell transfusions. CONCLUSION: This case showed that physicians should be aware of the potential side effect of metformin although it is infrequent.","['Kirkiz, Serap', 'Yarali, Nese', 'Arman Bilir, Ozlem', 'Tunc, Bahattin']","['Kirkiz S', 'Yarali N', 'Arman Bilir O', 'Tunc B']","[""Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20131127,Switzerland,Med Princ Pract,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",8901334,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/*chemically induced', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*drug therapy', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Metformin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",PMC5586851,2013/12/04 06:00,2014/10/28 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000356149 [pii]', '10.1159/000356149 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Princ Pract. 2014;23(2):183-5. doi: 10.1159/000356149.

The incidence, biological characteristics, and prognostic value of secondary MGUS in patients with MM remain undefined. We proceed with a retrospective systematic review of serum immunofixation electrophoresis studies performed in 438 cases of patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, including 409 cases of newly diagnosed MM and 29 cases of primary plasma cell leukemia. Secondary MGUS was more common in patients with myeloma who had undergone stem cell transplantation than in those who had not (17 [29.8%] of 57 versus 5 [1.4%] of 352, P < .001). The clinical parameters and cytogenetic characteristics in patients with or without secondary MGUS were comparable. The complete response rates in patients with or without secondary MGUS were 81.8% and 21.8% respectively (P < .01). For the cohort as a whole, secondary MGUS was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median, 52.0 months versus 22.5 months; P = .002) and overall survival (median, not reached versus 35.0 months; P < .001). The presence of secondary MGUS retained independent prognostic value with a moderate impact on overall survival (hazard ratio .128 [95% confidence interval .018 to .922]; P = .041) in the multivariate Cox regression model. However, when analysis was restricted to patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, no statistical differences in progression-free survival and overall survival were found. In conclusion, we observe that secondary MGUS was frequently observed in MM patients after transplantation and conferred a survival prolongation. The favorable survival in patients with secondary MGUS may be explained by beneficial effect from myeloablative therapy.","['Zou, Dehui', 'An, Gang', 'Zhu, Guoqing', 'Wang, Jinhong', 'Shi, Lihui', 'Meng, Hengxing', 'Xu, Yan', 'Sui, Weiwei', 'Deng, Shuhui', 'Zhan, Fenghuang', 'Qiu, Lugui']","['Zou D', 'An G', 'Zhu G', 'Wang J', 'Shi L', 'Meng H', 'Xu Y', 'Sui W', 'Deng S', 'Zhan F', 'Qiu L']","[""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Union Stem Cell & Gene Engineering Company Limited, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.', ""Department of Lymphoma & Myeloma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China.

The nature of the interactions between compounds 1-5 and DNA were studied using spectroscopic techniques (UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism). The binding constants for complexes of cholinesterase modulators with DNA were determined from UV-vis spectroscopic titrations (K=0.5 x 10(4)-8.9 x 10(5)M(-1)). The ability of the prepared analogues to relax topoisomerase I was studied with electrophoretic techniques and it was proved that ligands 4 and 5 inhibited this enzyme at a concentration of 30 muM. The biological activity of the novel compounds was assessed through an examination of changes in cell cycle distribution, mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular viability. Inhibitors 3-5 exhibited a cytotoxic effect on HL-60 (human acute promyelocytic leukaemia) cell culture, demonstrated a tendency to affect mitochondrial physiology and viability, and also forced cells to accumulate in the G1/G0-phase of the cell cycle. The cholinesterase reactivators 1 and 2 were found relatively save from the point of view of DNA binding, whereas cholinesterase inhibitors 3-5 resulted as strong DNA binding agents that limit their plausible use.","['Janockova, Jana', 'Gulasova, Zuzana', 'Plsikova, Jana', 'Musilek, Kamil', 'Kuca, Kamil', 'Mikes, Jaromir', 'Culka, Lubomir', 'Fedorocko, Peter', 'Kozurkova, Maria']","['Janockova J', 'Gulasova Z', 'Plsikova J', 'Musilek K', 'Kuca K', 'Mikes J', 'Culka L', 'Fedorocko P', 'Kozurkova M']","['Institute of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry, P.

One hundred and fourteen adult patients consecutively diagnosed with PML/RARalpha-positive APL and homogeneously treated with the AIDA induction schedule at a single institution were included in the study. Twelve (10.5%) and 9 (8%) of the 114 patients expressed CD15 and CD56, respectively. CD15 expression identified a subset of patients with a classic morphologic subtype (92%), a prevalent association with a bcr1 expression (67%) with an unexpectedly higher frequency of relapses (42% vs 20% for the CD15- patients, p=0.03) and a low overall survival (OS) (median OS at 5 years 58% vs 85% for the CD15- patients, p=0.01). CD56 expression was detected only in patients with a classic morphologic subtype, a prevalent bcr3 expression (67%), high incidence of differentiation syndrome (55%), higher frequency of relapse (34% vs 20% for the CD56- population, p=0.04) and a low OS (60% vs 85% for the CD56- population p=0.02). We hereby confirm the negative prognostic value of CD56 and we show that the same applies also to cases expressing CD15.

(Family Eucommiaceae), also known as Du-zhong (Chinese: ), Tuchong (in Japanese), is the sole species of the genus Eucommia. The leaf, stem, and bark as well as staminate flower of Eucommia ulmoides have been traditionally used to cure many diseases in China, Japan, Korea, among others. The aim of this review is to comprehensively outline the botanical description, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological activities, and toxicology of Eucommia ulmoides and to discuss possible trends for further study of Eucommia ulmoides. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on Eucommia ulmoides was gathered via the internet (using Pub Med, Elsevier, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, Medline Plus, ACS, CNKI, and Web of Science) and from books in local libraries. RESULTS: One-hundred twelve compounds of Eucommia ulmoides, including the main active constituents, lignans and iridoids, have been isolated and identified. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that monomer compounds and extracts from Eucommia ulmoides possess wide-ranging pharmacological actions, especially in treating hypertension, hyperlipemia, diabetes, obesity, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, aging, lupus-like syndrome, and immunoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Eucommia ulmoides has been used as a source of traditional medicine and as a beneficial health food. Phytochemical and pharmacological studies of Eucommia ulmoides have received much interest, and extracts and active compounds continue to be isolated and proven to exert various effects. Further toxicity and clinical studies are warranted to establish more detailed data on crude extracts and pure compounds, enabling more convenient preparations for patients.

These receptors play essential roles in development, cellular homeostasis, and disease including cancer where over- or underexpression of some receptors has prognostic significance for patient survival. Results of receptor knockdown or overexpression in vivo and in cancer cell lines demonstrate that orphan receptors exhibit tumor-specific pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressor-like activity. For example, COUP-TFII expression is both a positive (ovarian) and negative (prostate and breast) prognostic factor for cancer patients; in contrast, the prognostic activity of adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on chromosome X gene for the same tumors is the inverse of COUP-TFII. Functional studies show that Nur77 is tumor suppressor like in acute leukemia, whereas silencing Nur77 in pancreatic, colon, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, cervical, ovarian, gastric, and some breast cancer cell lines induces one or more of several responses including growth inhibition and decreased survival, migration, and invasion. Although endogenous ligands for the orphan receptors have not been identified, there is increasing evidence that different structural classes of compounds activate, inactivate, and directly bind several orphan receptors. Thus, the screening and development of selective orphan receptor modulators will have important clinical applications as novel mechanism-based agents for treating cancer patients overexpressing one or more orphan receptors and also for combined drug therapies.","['Safe, Stephen', 'Jin, Un-Ho', 'Hedrick, Erik', 'Reeder, Alexandra', 'Lee, Syng-Ook']","['Safe S', 'Jin UH', 'Hedrick E', 'Reeder A', 'Lee SO']","['Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology (S.S., E.H., A.R.), Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77808; and Institute of Biosciences and Technology (S.S., U.-H.J., S.-O.L.), Texas A&M Health Science Center, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20131202,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Orphan Nuclear Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",PMC3896638,2013/12/04 06:00,2015/01/08 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2013-1291 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2013-1291 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2014 Feb;28(2):157-72. doi: 10.1210/me.2013-1291.

Vorinostat is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases and was shown to attenuate GVHD in preclinical models. We aimed to study the safety and activity of vorinostat, in combination with standard immunoprophylaxis, for prevention of GVHD in patients undergoing related-donor reduced-intensity conditioning haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation. METHODS: Between March 31, 2009, and Feb 8, 2013, we did a prospective, single-arm, phase 1/2 study at two centres in the USA. We recruited adults (aged >/=18 years) with high-risk haematological malignant diseases who were candidates for reduced-intensity conditioning haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation and had an available 8/8 or 7/8 HLA-matched related donor. All patients received a conditioning regimen of fludarabine (40 mg/m(2) daily for 4 days) and busulfan (3.2 mg/kg daily for 2 days) and GVHD immunoprophylaxis of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g three times a day, days 0-28) and tacrolimus (0.03 mg/kg a day, titrated to a goal level of 8-12 ng/mL, starting day -3 until day 180). Vorinostat (either 100 mg or 200 mg, twice a day) was initiated 10 days before haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation until day 100. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD by day 100. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00810602. FINDINGS: 50 patients were assessable for both toxic effects and response; eight additional patients were included in the analysis of toxic effects. All patients engrafted neutrophils and platelets at expected times after haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD by day 100 was 22% (95% CI 13-36). The most common non-haematological adverse events included electrolyte disturbances (n=15), hyperglycaemia (11), infections (six), mucositis (four), and increased activity of liver enzymes (three). Non-symptomatic thrombocytopenia after engraftment was the most common haematological grade 3-4 adverse event (nine) but was transient and all cases resolved swiftly. INTERPRETATION: Administration of vorinostat in combination with standard GVHD prophylaxis after related-donor reduced-intensity conditioning haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation is safe and is associated with a lower than expected incidence of severe acute GVHD. Future studies are needed to assess the effect of vorinostat for prevention of GVHD in broader settings of haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

Somatic mutations in genes encoding IDH1 and IDH2 were first identified in glioma and subsequently in acute myeloid leukemia and other solid tumors. These heterozygous point mutations occur at the arginine residue of the enzyme's active site and cause both loss of normal enzyme function and gain of function, causing reduction of alpha-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which accumulates. D-2-hydroxyglutarate may act as an oncometabolite through the inhibition of various alpha-KG-dependent enzymes, stimulating angiogenesis, histone modifications and aberrant DNA methylation. Possibly, IDH mutations may also cause oncogenic effects through dysregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or by increasing susceptibility to oxidative stress.

Statins competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase, the major rate-limiting enzyme that controls the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. Specifically, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins has been proved to prevent the synthesis of mevalonic acid, a precursor of non-steroidal isoprenoids, which are lipid attachment molecules for small G proteins, such as Ras, Rho and Rac. Thus, statins may inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids and thereby suppress the activation of small G proteins. In addition, statins exert pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory effects, which may prevent cancer growth. Statins may inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer cell types, including breast, gastric, pancreatic, and prostate carcinoma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, mesothelioma and acute myeloid leukemia cells. They exert pro-apoptotic effects in a wide range of cancer cell lines, but with many differences in the sensitivity to statin-induced cell death among different cancer cell types. Regarding anti-angiogenic effects, multiple statin effects on blood vessel formation by inhibition of angiogenesis through down-regulation of pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of adhesion to extracellular matrix by blocking intercellular adhesion molecules have been suggested. The molecular mechanisms of statin immunomodulation often implicate multiple pathways, regarding the regulation of genes encoding key molecules, which are involved in antigen presentation and subsequent immunomodulation. Another mechanism involves the down-regulation of the nuclear factor-kappa-B, which is responsible for the transcription of many genes involved in immunologic mechanisms, such as interferon-inducible protein-10, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1 and cyclooxygenase-2. Statins have been associated with a significantly lower risk of breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, lung cancers and lymphoma in several observational studies. On the other hand, other studies, including meta-analyses have raised concerns about the safety of statins among elderly patients. A recent study upon the relationship between statin use (prior to cancer diagnosis) and cancer-related mortality in the entire Danish population from 1995-2009 in adults > 40 years of age has been conducted. As compared to statin non-users, patients using statins prior to cancer diagnosis were 15% less likely to die from any cause or cancer specifically.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Liposomes were prepared using the extrusion method and the bioactive lipids were encapsulated passively. Drug concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Antileukemic activity was evaluated using human leukemic cell lines, patient samples and U937 leukemic xenograft models. RESULTS: A stable liposome formulation was developed to coencapsulate safingol and C2-ceramide at 1:1 molar ratio with >90% encapsulation efficiency. The liposomal safingol/C2-ceramide was effective in AML cell lines, patient samples and murine xenograft models of AML, compared with liposomal safingol or liposomal C2-ceramide alone despite a dose reduction of 33%. CONCLUSION: Our study provided proof-of-concept evidence to deliver synergistic combination of bioactive lipid to achieve complete remission in AML.","['Tan, Kuan-Boone', 'Ling, Leong-Uung', 'Bunte, Ralph M', 'Chng, Wee-Joo', 'Chiu, Gigi N C']","['Tan KB', 'Ling LU', 'Bunte RM', 'Chng WJ', 'Chiu GN']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Block S4, 02-09, 18 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131203,England,Nanomedicine (Lond),"Nanomedicine (London, England)",101278111,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EAG959U971 (1,2-distearoyllecithin)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Ceramides/chemistry', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Chromatography, Liquid', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Liposomes/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2013/12/04 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/nnm.13.123 [doi]'],ppublish,Nanomedicine (Lond). 2014 Aug;9(11):1665-79. doi: 10.2217/nnm.13.123.

METHODS: NK cells was expanded on a layer of trophoblast cells with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL cell line for 21 days. The levels of receptors on NK cells were detected by flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity of expanded NK cells against leukemia cells and specific ligand of immunoglobulin like(Ig- liKe)receptors were assessed using 51Cr released assay. RESULTS: There were no differences of inhibitory receptors expression between fresh NK cells and expanded NK cells [CD158a:(16.77+/-11.65)% vs(14.37+/-11.12)%, P>0.05; CD158b: (42.48+/-18.11)% vs (40.92+/-19.02)%, P>0.05; NKG2A: (70.20+/-18.43)% vs (78.90+/-13.69)%, P>0.05], but higher activated receptors expression on expanded NK cells [NKp30: (54.10+/-13.27)% vs (4.14+/-2.05)%, P<0.05; NKp44: (72.10+/-17.30)% vs (0.52+/-1.16)%, P<0.05; NKp46: (80.63+/-14.01)% vs (44.19+/-6.19)%, P<0.05; NKG2D: (97.50+/-2.55)% vs (72.25+/-14.35)%, P<0.05]. Expanded NK cells showed higher cytotoxicity against leuKemia cell lines than fresh NK cells [K562: (74.3+/-3.6)% vs (55.3+/-4.2)%, P<0.05; Raji: (60.6+/-5.0)% vs (12.0+/-3.6)%, P<0.05]. CD158a(-) CD158b(-) NK cells had higher cytotoxicity on four types of target cells, but CD158a(+)CD158b(-) CB-NK cell had lower cytotoxicity on 221-Cw4 and 221-Cw3Cw4 cells. CD158a(-) CD158b(+) CB- NK cells had lower cytotoxicity on 221-Cw3 and 221-Cw3Cw4, but CD158a(+)CD158b(+) CB-NK cells had higher cytotoxicity on 721- 221 cells. CONCLUSION: Expression of activated receptors of expanded NK cells were up-regulated, but no changes of inhibitory receptors. Expanded NK cells showed high cytotoxicity against leukemia cells and kept the specificity of ligand of Ig-like receptors, which could be beneficial to cell-therapy for tumor.","['Zhou, Feng', 'Han, Wen-min', 'Jia, Zhu-xia', 'Yang, Jian-he', 'Xiao, Rong', 'Ma, Ling-di', 'Lu, Xu-zhang']","['Zhou F', 'Han WM', 'Jia ZX', 'Yang JH', 'Xiao R', 'Ma LD', 'Lu XZ']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou No.2 People's Hospital, Jiangsu 213003, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/*metabolism']",,2013/12/04 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.11.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Nov;34(11):952-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.11.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Jan;35(1):76.

METHODS: 12 patients with high-risk leukemia were analyzed, including Ph(+) acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=1), acute leukemia (AL) with persistent non-complete remission (n=2), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with central nervous system (CNS) relapse (n=3), hybrid AL (n=1), secondary AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS/AML) (n=2), chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase (CML-AP) (n=1), CML in blastic phase (CML-BP) (n=2). All patients received non-myeloablative conditioning and pG-DLIs were administered 30-40 days post transplantation if no signs of GVHD were present. The percentage of donor cell chimera was analyzed by short tandem repeat-polymerase chain reaction (STR-PCR) just before and after pG-DLI. The incidence of leukemia relapse and GVHD were observed. RESULTS: 12 high-risk leukemia patients with a median age of 38 (range: 29-52) years received G-DLI at a median interval of 35 (32-40) days. The median numbers of infused mononuclear cells (MNCs), CD34(+), and CD3(+) cells/kg recipient body weight was 2.3x10(8)/kg, 1.7x10(6)/kg, and 0.6x10(8)/kg, respectively. 10 of 12 patients had full donor chimera before pG-DLIs and conversion from mixed to full donor chimera occurred in the other 2 patients shortly after pG-DLI. Grade II acute GVHD (aGVHD) was observed in only 2 patients and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) developed in 6 patients, including involvement of skin (n=3), skin and intestine (n=2), liver (n=1). 1 patient died of cGVHD. With a median follow-up of 40 (24-64) months, 7 patients are alive in remission, with 3-year actuarial overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the same 58.3%. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that pG-DLI after NST does not increase the risk of aGVHD, but could enhance the capacity graft-vs-leukemia and prevent relapse in high-risk leukemia patients.","['Zhao, Hong-xia', 'Sun, Wan-jun', 'Li, Jie', 'Qiao, Jun-xiao', 'Huang, Ya-jing', 'Hu, Hai-lan', 'Ai, Hui-sheng']","['Zhao HX', 'Sun WJ', 'Li J', 'Qiao JX', 'Huang YJ', 'Hu HL', 'Ai HS']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing 100088, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2013/12/04 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2013/12/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.11.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Nov;34(11):922-5. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.11.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we describe the third documented case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) accompanying follicular mucinosis. A 72-year-old Japanese male presented with persistent erythema in his arm and neck. Laboratory tests demonstrated positivity for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1 antibodies. Histopathological study of the biopsy specimen from the neck revealed superficial perivascular, nodular, and intrafollicular lymphocytic infiltrations. These lymphocytes were small- to medium-sized and had convoluted nuclei. Mucoid material deposition was observed within the hair follicles, and it was digested by hyaluronidase. Immunohistochemically, these lymphocytes were positive for CD3, CD4, CD25, and Foxp3. Accordingly, an ultimate diagnosis of ATLL accompanying follicular mucinosis was made. The skin is the most common extralymphatic site of involvement of ATLL. The present case clearly demonstrated that albeit extremely rare, ATLL can cause follicular mucinosis. Therefore, ATLL should be included in the differential diagnostic consideration of follicular mucinosis.","['Ishida, Mitsuaki', 'Iwai, Muneo', 'Yoshida, Keiko', 'Kagotani, Akiko', 'Okabe, Hidetoshi']","['Ishida M', 'Iwai M', 'Yoshida K', 'Kagotani A', 'Okabe H']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine and Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Shiga University of Medical Science Shiga, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20131115,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mucinosis, Follicular/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications/immunology/pathology/virology']",PMC3843287,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/08/05 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2013 Nov 15;6(12):3014-8. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'follicular mucinosis', 'skin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of breakthrough fungal infections in pediatric hematopoetic stem cell transplant recipients, and oncology and hematology patients receiving caspofungin. METHODS: A five-year retrospective review, from 2004 through 2008, of all cases of proven invasive filamentous fungal infection of children admitted to The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario) was conducted. A breakthrough infection was defined as new onset of symptoms that were later proven to be due to an invasive mold infection on day 3 or later after initiation of caspofungin therapy. RESULTS: Six confirmed positive cultures (Aspergillus fumigatus [two cases], Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria infectoria and Rhizomucor pusillus) met the criteria for breakthrough filamentous mold infection while on caspofungin therapy. Underlying immunocompromising conditions included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (two cases), acute myeloid leukemia (two cases), Burkitt's lymphoma and aplastic anemia. Four of the patients underwent a hematopoetic stem cell transplant. All patients received a lipid amphotericin B product as part of their treatment for breakthrough infection. Five patients also received voriconazole and one received posaconazole. Four of the six patients died and two responded with a clinical and microbiological cure. DISCUSSION: There are few descriptions of breakthrough fungal infections in pediatric patients receiving caspofungin.

Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic blasts plays an important role in classification and prognosis in ALL patients. The purpose of this study was to define the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities of ALL patients in adults and children in Fars province, Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated karyotype results of bone marrow specimens in 168 Iranian patients with ALL (154 B-ALL and 14 T-ALL) in Fars Province using the conventional cytogenetic G-banding method. RESULTS: The frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities, including numerical and/or structural changes, was 61.7% and 53.8% in the B-ALL and T-ALL patients, respectively. Hyperdiploidy was the most common (32%) cytogenetic abnormality. Among structural abnormalities, the most common was t(9;22) in 11% of the patients. The children showed a higher incidence of hyperdiploidy and lower incidence of t(9;22) than adults (P<0.05). We found a lower incidence of recurrent abnormalities such as 11q23, t(1;19), and t(12;21) than those reported in previous studies. CONCLUSION: Normal karyotype was more frequent in our study. The frequencies of some cytogenetic abnormalities such as hyperdiploidy and t(9;22) in our study were comparable to those reported in the literature. The results of this study in Fars Province can be used as baseline information for treatment decision and research purposes in ALL patients. We recommend the use of advanced molecular techniques in the future to better elucidate cryptic cytogenetic abnormalities.","['Safaei, Akbar', 'Shahryari, Jahanbanoo', 'Farzaneh, Mohamad Reza', 'Tabibi, Narjes', 'Hosseini, Marzieh']","['Safaei A', 'Shahryari J', 'Farzaneh MR', 'Tabibi N', 'Hosseini M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Med Sci,Iranian journal of medical sciences,8104374,,,,PMC3838981,2013/12/03 06:00,2013/12/03 06:01,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/03 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Med Sci. 2013 Dec;38(4):301-7.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chromosomal abnormalities', 'Cytogenetic analysis', 'Incidence', 'Iran']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to describe its incidence and main risk factors and to evaluate the current treatment options, we reviewed 105 children with a mean age of 8.25 years (1 to 17.8) who had acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukaemia, or a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Overall, eight children (7.6%) developed AVN after a mean of 16.8 months (8 to 49). There were four boys and four girls with a mean age of 14.4 years (9.8 to 16.8) and a total of 18 involved sites, 12 of which were in the femoral head. All these children were aged > nine years (p < 0.001). All had received steroid treatment with a mean cumulative dose of prednisone of 5967 mg (4425 to 9599) compared with a mean of 3943 mg (0 to 18 585) for patients without AVN (p = 0.005). No difference existed between genders and no thrombophilic disorders were identified. Their initial treatment included 11 core decompressions and two bipolar hip replacements. Later, two salvage osteotomies were done and three patients (four hips) eventually needed a total joint replacement. We conclude that AVN mostly affects the weight-bearing epiphyses. Its risk increases with age and higher steroid doses. These high-risk patients may benefit from early screening for AVN.","['Salem, K H', 'Brockert, A-K', 'Mertens, R', 'Drescher, W']","['Salem KH', 'Brockert AK', 'Mertens R', 'Drescher W']","['Cairo University, Kasr Al-Aini Str., 11562 CairoEgypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Bone Joint J,The bone & joint journal,101599229,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Decompression, Surgical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Femur Head Necrosis/chemically induced/diagnosis/surgery', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/surgery', 'Osteotomy/methods', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['95-B/12/1708 [pii]', '10.1302/0301-620X.95B12.30688 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Joint J. 2013 Dec;95-B(12):1708-13. doi: 10.1302/0301-620X.95B12.30688.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Avascular necrosis', 'Chemotherapy', 'Childhood lymphomas', 'Core decompression', 'Leukaemias', 'Steroids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a complete remission (CR) was obtained after induction chemotherapy, the first post-remission therapy was discontinued because of severe cardiovascular complications. She had a relapse of AML with CD33-positive myeloblasts which comprised 38.4 % of the bone marrow cells in November 2007. She received two courses of low-dose chemotherapy because of the previous complications. The amount of Wilm's tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA in the peripheral blood was 13,000 copies/mug RNA after the first course of the chemotherapy, and 4.8 % myeloblasts remained in the bone marrow after the second course. She was treated with a single course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), with a subsequent CR with 0.9 % marrow myeloblasts and fewer than 50 copies of WT-1 mRNA (normal level). Thereafter, she received five courses of GO monotherapy at each occasion of early AML relapse. Hematological remission has been sustained over a period of about 24 months with the GO monotherapy alone. This case suggests that GO monotherapy is a useful salvage therapy for early relapse of CD33-positive AML in situations in which standard chemotherapy is not indicated.","['Tsunemine, Hiroko', 'Akasaka, Hiroshi', 'Sakane, Emiko Ishikawa', 'Ito, Kiminari', 'Kodaka, Taiichi', 'Takahashi, Takayuki']","['Tsunemine H', 'Akasaka H', 'Sakane EI', 'Ito K', 'Kodaka T', 'Takahashi T']","['Department of Hematology, Shinko Hospital, 4-47 Wakihama-cho, 1-chome, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 651-0072, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20131201,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy/adverse effects', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1481-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Feb;99(2):193-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1481-y.

Furthermore, side effects were more common for patients carrying 15631GG genotypes when compared with GT/TT carriers (36 vs. 13.8 %; X (2) = 8.3, p = 0.004). In light of our results, identification of 15631G>T polymorphism in CML patients might be helpful to predict therapeutic response to imatinib.","['Kassogue, Yaya', 'Quachouh, Meryem', 'Dehbi, Hind', 'Quessar, Asma', 'Benchekroun, Said', 'Nadifi, Sellama']","['Kassogue Y', 'Quachouh M', 'Dehbi H', 'Quessar A', 'Benchekroun S', 'Nadifi S']","['Genetics and Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Medical School of Casablanca, University Hassan II, 19 Rue Tarik Ibnou Ziad, BP 9154, Casablanca, Morocco, kassoy2@yahoo.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131129,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2B6 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morocco', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/07/26 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0782-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Jan;31(1):782. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0782-6.

This ecologic study uses quantitative exposure data, updated mortality data, and improved statistical methods to study the impact of oil exploration and production activities on cancer mortality rates in the Oriente. METHODS: Cancer mortality rates in the Oriente in 1990 through 2010 were compared between seven cantons with active oil exploration and production as of 1990 and thirteen cantons with little or no such activities. Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for age and sex. In a two-stage analysis, canton-specific log-RRs were regressed against quantitative estimates of cumulative barrels of oil produced and well-years per canton, adjusting for canton-level demographic and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Overall and site-specific cancer mortality rates were comparable between oil-producing and non-oil-producing cantons. For overall cancer mortality in males and females combined, the RR comparing oil-producing to non-oil-producing cantons was 0.85 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.72-1.00]. For leukemia mortality, the corresponding RR was 0.80 (95 % CI 0.57-1.13). Results also revealed no excess of mortality from acute non-lymphocytic, myeloid, or childhood leukemia. Standardized mortality ratios were consistent with RRs. Canton-specific RRs showed no pattern in relation to oil production volume or well-years. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this first ecologic study to incorporate quantitative measures of oil exploration and production showed no association between the extent of these activities and cancer mortality, including from cancers associated with benzene exposure.","['Moolgavkar, Suresh H', 'Chang, Ellen T', 'Watson, Heather', 'Lau, Edmund C']","['Moolgavkar SH', 'Chang ET', 'Watson H', 'Lau EC']","['Health Sciences Practice, Exponent, Inc., 149 Commonwealth Drive, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA, moolgavkar@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131130,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['0 (Oils)'],IM,"['Ecology', 'Ecuador', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Oils/*adverse effects']",PMC3889987,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-013-0308-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2014 Jan;25(1):59-72. doi: 10.1007/s10552-013-0308-8.

To elucidate the involvement of IDs in hematopoiesis and acute leukemias (AL), we analyzed ID2 and ID3 expression in hematopoiesis and leukemic blasts in bone marrow biopsies (BMB). BMB of healthy stem cell donors (n = 19) and BMB of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MD; n = 19), de novo AML (n = 20), B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (n = 23), T-ALL (n = 19), were immunohistochemically stained for ID2 and ID3 expression. The expression patterns were evaluated and quantified for each hematopoietic lineage and each leukemia subtype. In normal BMB, immature granulopoiesis showed weak ID2 and strong ID3 expression, which was lost during maturation (p < 0.001). Erythropoiesis remained negative for ID2/3 (p < 0.001). ID2/3 expression differed between immature granulopoiesis and leukemic blasts (p < 0.001). Moreover, differential ID2/3 expression was seen between AL subgroups: AML, especially AML-MD, had more ID2- (p < 0.001) and ID3-positive (p < 0.001) blasts than ALL. We show a comprehensive in situ picture of ID2/3 expression in hematopoiesis and AL. Morphologically, ID2/3 proteins seem to be involved in the granulopoietic maturation.

HTLV-I bZIP factor (HBZ), which is expressed in all adult T-cell leukemia cells, plays a critical role in the development of lymphoma and systemic inflammation. HTLV-I is harbored by CD4(+) T cells that express forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), and HBZ interacts with Foxp3. This study investigated the chest computed tomography (CT) findings and expression of HBZ and Foxp3 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with HTLV-I-associated lung disorders. METHODS: CT scans obtained from 37 patients (10 men and 27 women, aged 37-77 years) with HTLV-I-associated lung disorders were retrospectively evaluated. The expression levels of HBZ and Foxp3 mRNA in BAL cells and the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the BAL fluid (BALF) from patients were compared with those in control subjects. RESULTS: CT scans frequently revealed a diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB)-like pattern, along with a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. An analysis of the BALF revealed lymphocytosis and increased expression of HBZ mRNA in patients with HTLV-I-associated lung disorders. The expression of Foxp3 mRNA positively correlated with the percentages of lymphocytes present in the BALF. The inflammatory cytokine and IL-10 levels were significantly increased in the BALF from patients with HTLV-I-associated lung disorders. CONCLUSION: The NSIP pattern may be a manifestation of pulmonary involvement in HTLV-I-infected patients, as is the DPB-like pattern. HBZ and Foxp3 likely have a role in the development of lung inflammation.","['Nakayama, Yuko', 'Yamazato, Yoriko', 'Tamayose, Maki', 'Atsumi, Eriko', 'Yara, Satomi', 'Higa, Futoshi', 'Tateyama, Masao', 'Fujita, Jiro']","['Nakayama Y', 'Yamazato Y', 'Tamayose M', 'Atsumi E', 'Yara S', 'Higa F', 'Tateyama M', 'Fujita J']","['Department of Infectious, Respiratory, and Digestive Medicine, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry/cytology/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/diagnostic imaging/*genetics/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Lung Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*genetics/*virology', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/diagnostic imaging/genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/52.0845 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.52.0845 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2013;52(23):2599-609. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.52.0845.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are very few therapies available for NSCLCs due to the recalcitrant nature of this cancer. Mutations that activate the small GTPase KRAS are found in 20% to 30% of NSCLCs. Here, we report that inhibition of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) by the small molecule ATN-224 induced cell death in various NSCLC cells, including those harboring KRAS mutations. ATN-224-dependent SOD1 inhibition increased superoxide, which diminished enzyme activity of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase, leading to an increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) levels. We found that ATN-224-induced cell death was mediated through H(2)O(2)-dependent activation of P38 MAPK and that P38 activation led to a decrease in the antiapoptotic factor MCL1, which is often upregulated in NSCLC. Treatment with both ATN-224 and ABT-263, an inhibitor of the apoptosis regulators BCL2/BCLXL, augmented cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATN-224 reduced tumor burden in a mouse model of NSCLC. Our results indicate that antioxidant inhibition by ATN-224 has potential clinical applications as a single agent, or in combination with other drugs, for the treatment of patients with various forms of NSCLC, including KRAS-driven cancers.","['Glasauer, Andrea', 'Sena, Laura A', 'Diebold, Lauren P', 'Mazar, Andrew P', 'Chandel, Navdeep S']","['Glasauer A', 'Sena LA', 'Diebold LP', 'Mazar AP', 'Chandel NS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (SOD1 protein, human)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '81AH48963U (Molybdenum)', '91U3TGV99T (tetrathiomolybdate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Sod1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase-1)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molybdenum/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase-1', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3871252,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/03/04 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['71714 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI71714 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2014 Jan;124(1):117-28. doi: 10.1172/JCI71714.,,,,,"['F30 ES019815/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000150/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HL76139/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30ES019815/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA123067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL076139/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZRF1, a recently characterized epigenetic factor involved in transcriptional regulation, is highly overexpressed in human AML, but it is not known whether it plays a role in leukemia progression. Here, we demonstrate that ZRF1 depletion decreases cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and enhances cell differentiation in human AML cells. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA), a differentiating agent currently used to treat certain AMLs, leads to a functional switch of ZRF1 from a negative regulator to an activator of differentiation. At the molecular level, ZRF1 controls the RA-regulated gene network through its interaction with the RA receptor alpha (RARalpha) and its binding to RA target genes. Our genome-wide expression study reveals that ZRF1 regulates the transcription of nearly half of RA target genes. Consistent with our in vitro observations that ZRF1 regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, ZRF1 depletion strongly inhibits leukemia progression in a xenograft mouse model. Finally, ZRF1 knockdown cooperates with RA treatment in leukemia suppression in vivo. Taken together, our data reveal that ZRF1 is a key transcriptional regulator in leukemia progression and suggest that ZRF1 inhibition could be a novel strategy to be explored for AML treatment.","['Demajo, S', 'Uribesalgo, I', 'Gutierrez, A', 'Ballare, C', 'Capdevila, S', 'Roth, M', 'Zuber, J', 'Martin-Caballero, J', 'Di Croce, L']","['Demajo S', 'Uribesalgo I', 'Gutierrez A', 'Ballare C', 'Capdevila S', 'Roth M', 'Zuber J', 'Martin-Caballero J', 'Di Croce L']","['1] Centre de Regulacio Genomica (CRG), Barcelona, Spain [2] UPF, Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Centre de Regulacio Genomica (CRG), Barcelona, Spain [2] UPF, Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Centre de Regulacio Genomica (CRG), Barcelona, Spain [2] UPF, Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Centre de Regulacio Genomica (CRG), Barcelona, Spain [2] UPF, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Unidad de Animal de Laboratorio, PRBB, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna, Austria.', 'Unidad de Animal de Laboratorio, PRBB, Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Centre de Regulacio Genomica (CRG), Barcelona, Spain [2] UPF, Barcelona, Spain [3] Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131202,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNAJC2 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2015/01/22 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013501 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.501 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Nov 27;33(48):5501-10. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.501.

Data were collected from 208 consecutive, mainly pretreated, patients with CLL (n = 202), and B-PLL (n = 6) who had received alemtuzumab. Response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in various settings were assessed, and toxicities were documented. In these routine patients, a comparably low cumulative dose of alemtuzumab (median, 403 mg) was applied. In CLL, overall response rate was 32 %, and various pre-therapeutic parameters were predictive for inferior response, among them, the prior administration of >/=3 therapy lines (P < 0.001), refractoriness to fludarabine (P = 0.002), and bulky lymphadenopathy (P = 0.003). PFS and OS after start of alemtuzumab were 6.2 and 21.0 months, respectively. Bulky lymphadenopathy was the prominent risk factor for both inferior PFS (P < 0.001) and OS (P = 0.002). In B-PLL, four patients experienced a fatal outcome, whereas two patients had some benefit with alemtuzumab. The main adverse effects were CMV reactivation (20 %) and a broad spectrum of infections, which together were the main reasons for treatment interruption and/or premature termination. In conclusion, alemtuzumab administered even at low dose levels was effective but overall considerably toxic in routine CLL patients.

But we accidently found it had an entirely opposite action on malignant tumor cells derived from T cells. Thus, influence of ionomycin on human leukemia Jurkat T cell behaviors and its preliminary mechanistic process were explored in the presence of PDBu. Ionomycin could remarkably inhibit colony formation of the cells, and inhibitory rate of the cell proliferation was increased with ionomycin treatment in a dose- or time-related relationship, following the reduction of ERK1/2 and phosphorylated-ERK1/2 levels. However, a high dose of ionomycin might moderately repress mid-stage activation of the cells. It also blocked the cell entry at S-phase and G2/M-phase with the attenuation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) level in the cells, and promoted the cell apoptosis following the augment of caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 in the cells. The dramatic elevation of [Ca2(+)]i and intracellular pH (pHi) was simultaneously followed by the above alteration of the cell behaviors. These results indicate that ionomycin may strongly inhibit human acute T lymphocyte leukemia progress in the presence of PDBu through the inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling, the activation of caspase-3 and the attenuation of TGF-beta mediated by the [Ca2(+)]i and pHi enhancement, providing a novel insight into function and potential application of both ionomycin and PDBu.","['Wang, Yuan', 'Hao, Wenting', 'Xing, Rui', 'Di, Jingfang', 'Zeng, Shan', 'Liu, Jing', 'Xing, Feiyue']","['Wang Y', 'Hao W', 'Xing R', 'Di J', 'Zeng S', 'Liu J', 'Xing F']","['Institute of Tissue Transplantation and Immunology, Department of Immunobiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131129,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Calcium Ionophores)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/*pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/05/30 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1955-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 May;93(5):735-46. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1955-2.

This retrospective study aimed to analyze the outcome of adult patients who received allo-SCT in a chemo-refractory/relapsed status. The series included 840 patients with active or progressive disease at the time of transplant. Median age was 50 years. With a median follow-up of 40 months, 3-year OS, disease-free survival (DFS), and non-relapse mortality rates were 29+/-2, 23+/-2, and 30+/-2%, respectively. At the last follow-up, 252 patients (30%) were still alive (of whom 201 were in CR (24%). In a Cox multivariate analysis, the use of a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) before allo-SCT and use of an HLA-identical sibling donor remained independently associated with a better OS (hazard ratio (HR)=0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-0.98, P=0.03; and HR=0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.93, P=0.006, respectively).

Inflammation has previously been shown to increase levels of extracellular beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). The present study demonstrates that extracellular NAD(+) at concentrations found in the inflamed tissues profoundly delays spontaneous apoptosis of human neutrophils as was evidenced by inhibition of phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. The effect was abrogated by NF157, an antagonist of P2Y11 receptor, and was pertussis toxin-insensitive. The NAD(+)-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis was reversed by 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS, an inhibitor of type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Blocking of NAD(+)-induced influx of extracellular Ca(2+) with EGTA did not abolish the pro-survival effect of NAD(+). Extracellular NAD(+) inhibited proteasome-dependent degradation of Mcl-1 upstream of caspase activation and, furthermore, suppressed Bax translocation to the mitochondria and attenuated both dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Finally, we found that extracellular NAD(+) inhibited spontaneous activation of caspase-9, but not caspase-8, and the pro-survival effect of extracellular NAD(+) was abrogated by the inhibitor of caspase-9, but not by the inhibitor of caspase-8. Together, these results demonstrate that extracellular NAD(+) inhibits neutrophil apoptosis via P2Y11 receptor and cAMP/PKA pathway by regulating Mcl-1 level, Bax targeting to the mitochondria and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Thus, extracellular NAD(+) acts as a neutrophil survival factor that can contribute to prolonged neutrophil lifespan in inflammatory response.","['Pliyev, Boris K', 'Ivanova, Anna V', 'Savchenko, Valery G']","['Pliyev BK', 'Ivanova AV', 'Savchenko VG']","['Hematology Research Center, Novy Zykovsky Pr. 4, Moscow, 125167, Russia, bpliyev@cardio.ru.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (P2RY11 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'NAD/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0948-x [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2014 Apr;19(4):581-93. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0948-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant signals of STAT induce uncontrolled cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance and are strongly involved in cancer. STAT has been identified as a promising target for antitumor drugs, but to date most trials have not been successful. Here, we demonstrated that a novel STAT inhibitor, OPB-31121, strongly inhibited STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation without upstream kinase inhibition, and induced significant growth inhibition in various hematopoietic malignant cells. Investigation of various cell lines suggested that OPB-31121 is particularly effective against multiple myeloma, Burkitt lymphoma and leukemia harboring BCR-ABL, FLT3/ITD and JAK2 V617F, oncokinases with their oncogenicities dependent on STAT3/5. Using an immunodeficient mouse transplantation system, we showed the significant antitumor effect of OPB-31121 against primary human leukemia cells harboring these aberrant kinases and its safety for normal human cord blood cells. Finally, we demonstrated a model to overcome drug resistance to upstream kinase inhibitors with a STAT inhibitor. These results suggested that OPB-31121 is a promising antitumor drug.

In recent years, efforts have shifted to focus on sets of genes known to perform related biological functions (i.e. in the same pathways). Evaluating gene sets reduces the need to correct for false positives in multiple hypothesis testing. However, pathways are often large, and genes in the same pathway that do not contribute to the disease can cause a method to miss the pathway. In addition, large pathways may not give much insight to the cause of the disease. Moreover, when such a method is applied independently to two datasets of the same disease phenotypes, the two resulting lists of significant pathways often have low agreement. RESULTS: We present a powerful method, PFSNet, that identifies smaller parts of pathways (which we call subnetworks), and show that significant subnetworks (and the genes therein) discovered by PFSNet are up to 51% (64%) more consistent across independent datasets of the same disease phenotypes, even for datasets based on different platforms, than previously published methods. We further show that those methods which initially declared some large pathways to be insignificant would declare subnetworks detected by PFSNet in those large pathways to be significant, if they were given those subnetworks as input instead of the entire large pathways.

Therapeutic drug monitoring targeting trough plasma levels of about 1000 ng/mL may help to optimize imantinib's therapeutic effect.

Anti-imatinib antibody was obtained by immunizing rabbits with an antigen conjugated with bovine serum albumin and succinimidyl 4-{(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl}-benzoate. Enzyme labeling of imatinib with horseradish peroxidase was similarly performed using succinimidyl 4-{(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl}-benzoate. A simple ELISA for imatinib was developed using the principle of direct competition between imatinib and the enzyme marker for anti-imatinib antibody which had been adsorbed by the plastic surface of a microtiter plate. Serum imatinib concentrations lower than 40 pg/mL were reproducibly measurable using the ELISA. This ELISA was specific to imatinib and showed very slight cross-reactivity (1.2%) with a major metabolite, N-desmethyl imatinib. Using this assay, drug levels were easily measured in the blood of mice after their oral administration of imatinib at a single dose of 50 mg/kg. The specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA for imatinib should provide a valuable new tool for use in therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies of imatinib.","['Saita, Tetsuya', 'Shin, Masashi', 'Fujito, Hiroshi']","['Saita T', 'Shin M', 'Fujito H']","['Applied Life Science Department, Faculty of Biotechnology and Life Science, Sojo University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Benzamides/*analysis/chemistry/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Female', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Piperazines/*analysis/chemistry/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*analysis/chemistry/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*analysis/chemistry/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Rabbits', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/bpb/b13-00597 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.b13-00597 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2013;36(12):1964-8. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b13-00597.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They fall into a number of branches that can be functionally categorized into two major sub-groups: i) orthodox aquaporins, which are water-specific channels, and ii) aquaglyceroporins, which allow the transport of water, non-polar solutes, such as urea or glycerol, the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, and gases such as ammonia, carbon dioxide and nitric oxide and, as described in this review, metalloids. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the key findings that AQP channels conduct bidirectional movement of metalloids into and out of cells. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: As(OH)3 and Sb(OH)3 behave as inorganic molecular mimics of glycerol, a property that allows their passage through AQP channels. Plant AQPs also allow the passage of boron and silicon as their hydroxyacids, boric acid (B(OH)3) and orthosilicic acid (Si(OH)4), respectively. Genetic analysis suggests that germanic acid (GeO2) is also a substrate. While As(III), Sb(III) and Ge(IV) are toxic metalloids, borate (B(III)) and silicate (Si(IV)) are essential elements in higher plants. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The uptake of environmental metalloids by aquaporins provides an understanding of (i) how toxic elements such as arsenic enter the food chain; (ii) the delivery of arsenic and antimony containing drugs in the treatment of certain forms of leukemia and chemotherapy of diseases caused by pathogenic protozoa; and (iii) the possibility that food plants such as rice could be made safer by genetically modifying them to exclude arsenic while still accumulating boron and silicon.

We performed a case-control study with 570 childhood ALL cases and 673 cancer-free controls to investigate the association between hsa-miR-196a2 rs11614913 T>C polymorphism and ALL risk. The bioinformatics was used to estimate the potential target of hsa-miR-196a2. In the present study, the hsa-miR-196a2 variant TC heterozygote, and CC/TC genotypes were found to be associated with a significantly increased childhood ALL risk, compared with the TT wild-type homozygote (adjusted OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.15-1.95 for TC and OR=1.40, 95% CI=1.09-1.79 for CC/TC). Further, the difference was pronounced in younger (</=6) subjects or parental non-drinker. The significance of the increased risk is more obvious than the higher treatment branch. Additionally, we found that the rs11614913 TC genotype can increase B-phenotype ALL risk (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.07-1.76). Finally, combination of three bioinformatics approaches revealed that HOXC8 may be the target gene of hsa-miR-196a2. Taken together, our finding suggested that hsa-miR-196a2 rs11614913 T>C may increase the risk of childhood ALL. Large studies with the function of hsa-miR-196a2 are needed in the further study.","['Tong, Na', 'Xu, Bin', 'Shi, Danni', 'Du, Mulong', 'Li, Xin', 'Sheng, Xiaojing', 'Wang, Meilin', 'Chu, Haiyan', 'Fang, Yongjun', 'Li, Jie', 'Wu, Dongmei', 'Zhang, Zhengdong']","['Tong N', 'Xu B', 'Shi D', 'Du M', 'Li X', 'Sheng X', 'Wang M', 'Chu H', 'Fang Y', 'Li J', 'Wu D', 'Zhang Z']","['Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Surgical Research Center, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Affiliated Nanjing Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Soochow Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Environmental Genomics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Genetic Toxicology, The Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.

We have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ovarian cancer spheroids resist anoikis, choosing as models the 2 well-characterized human ovarian cancer cell lines IGROV1 and SKOV3. These cell lines have the propensity to float as clusters, and were isolated from tumor tissue and ascites, respectively. To form spheroids, IGROV1 and SKOV3 ovarian adenocarcinoma cells were maintained under anchorage-independent culture conditions, in which both lines survive at least a week. A short apoptotic period prior to a survival signaling commitment was observed for IGROV1 cells whereas SKOV3 cells entered G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. This difference in behavior was due to different signals. With regard to SKOV3 cells, activation of p38 and an increase in p130/Rb occurred once anchorage-independent culture was established. Analyses of the survival signaling pathway switched on by IGROV1 cells showed that activation of ERK1/2 was required to evade apoptosis, an effect partly dependent on PKC activation and alphav integrins. alphav-integrin expression is essential for survival through activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The above data indicate that ovarian cancer cells can resist anoikis in the spheroid state by arrest in the cell cycle or through activation of alphav-integrin-ERK-mediated survival signals. Such signaling might result in the selection of resistant cells within disseminating spheroids, favoring further relapse in ovarian cancers.","['Carduner, Ludovic', 'Picot, Cedric R', 'Leroy-Dudal, Johanne', 'Blay, Lyvia', 'Kellouche, Sabrina', 'Carreiras, Franck']","['Carduner L', 'Picot CR', 'Leroy-Dudal J', 'Blay L', 'Kellouche S', 'Carreiras F']","['Equipe de Recherche sur les Relations Matrice Extracellulaire Cellules, ERRMECe (EA 1391), Institut des Materiaux, Universite de Cergy-Pontoise, 2 avenue Adolphe Chauvin, 95302 Cergy-Pontoise Cedex, France.', 'Equipe de Recherche sur les Relations Matrice Extracellulaire Cellules, ERRMECe (EA 1391), Institut des Materiaux, Universite de Cergy-Pontoise, 2 avenue Adolphe Chauvin, 95302 Cergy-Pontoise Cedex, France.

Each KMT2A-E contains a catalytic SET domain that methylates lysine 4 of histone H3, and one or several PHD fingers. Over the past few years a growing number of studies have uncovered diverse biological roles of the KMT2A-E PHD fingers, implicating them in binding to methylated histones and other nuclear proteins, and in mediating the E3 ligase activity and dimerization. Mutations in the PHD fingers or deletion of these modules are linked to human diseases including cancer and Kabuki syndrome. In this work, we summarize recently identified biological functions of the KMT2A-E PHD fingers, discuss mechanisms of their action, and examine preference of these domains for histone and non-histone ligands.","['Ali, Muzaffar', 'Hom, Robert A', 'Blakeslee, Weston', 'Ikenouye, Larissa', 'Kutateladze, Tatiana G']","['Ali M', 'Hom RA', 'Blakeslee W', 'Ikenouye L', 'Kutateladze TG']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

Here, we identify the AKT1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.","['Piovan, Erich', 'Yu, Jiyang', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Herranz, Daniel', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Da Silva, Ana Carolina', 'Sanchez-Martin, Marta', 'Perez-Garcia, Arianne', 'Rigo, Isaura', 'Castillo, Mireia', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Cross, Justin R', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Racevskis, Janis', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Meijerink, Jules P', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Califano, Andrea', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Piovan E', 'Yu J', 'Tosello V', 'Herranz D', 'Ambesi-Impiombato A', 'Da Silva AC', 'Sanchez-Martin M', 'Perez-Garcia A', 'Rigo I', 'Castillo M', 'Indraccolo S', 'Cross JR', 'de Stanchina E', 'Paietta E', 'Racevskis J', 'Rowe JM', 'Tallman MS', 'Basso G', 'Meijerink JP', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Califano A', 'Ferrando AA']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova, 35128, Italy.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita' di Padova, Padova, Padova, Veneto, 35128, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto, IRCCS, Padova, Veneto, 35128, Italy.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova, 35128, Italy.', 'Donald B. and Catherine C.

Among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the 2-year cumulative incidence of VTE is 5.2%. Several studies suggest that microvesicles (MVs) harboring TF may play a role in VTE and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The aim of this study was to assess the capacity of untreated (APL) cells to shed procoagulant MVs. APL cells (NB4 and HL-60 cell lines) and MVs were separated by filtration (0.1-0.22-0.45-0.65 mum). The procoagulant activity (PCA) was assessed by thrombin generation assay (TGA). Alternatively, MVs were incubated with anti-Tissue Factor (TF) antibodies, with annexin V to assess the contribution of TF and phospholipids (PL) to the PCA, respectively. NB4 cells had a high PCA mainly triggered by MVs of size under 0.45 mum. The PCA of MVs was related to the expression of active TF and PL.

Notably, data from several recent studies have provided new insights into the regulation of erythroid gene transcription. Transcription profiling demonstrates that erythropoiesis is mainly controlled by a small group of lineage-restricted transcription factors [Gata binding protein 1 (Gata1), T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 protein (Tal1), and Erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF; henceforth referred to as Klf1)]. Binding-site mapping using ChIP-Seq indicates that most DNA-bound Gata1 and Tal1 proteins are contained within higher order complexes (Ldb1 complexes) that include the nuclear adapters Ldb1 and Lmo2. Ldb1 complexes regulate Klf1, and Ldb1 complex-binding sites frequently colocalize with Klf1 at erythroid genes and cis-regulatory elements, indicating strong functional synergy between Gata1, Tal1, and Klf1. Together with new data demonstrating that Ldb1 can mediate long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, these findings provide a foundation for the first comprehensive models of the global regulation of erythroid gene transcription.","['Love, Paul E', 'Warzecha, Claude', 'Li, LiQi']","['Love PE', 'Warzecha C', 'Li L']","['Eunice Kennedy Shriver, National Institute of Child Health & Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Therefore they are the central component in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, in particular childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (chALL). GCs act mainly via regulating gene transcription, which has been intensively studied by us and others. GC control of mRNA translation has also been reported but has never been assessed systematically. In this study we investigate the effect of GCs on mRNA translation on a genome-wide scale. RESULTS: Childhood T- (CCRF-CEM) and precursor B-ALL (NALM6) cells were exposed to GCs and subjected to ""translational profiling"", a technique combining sucrose-gradient fractionation followed by Affymetrix Exon microarray analysis of mRNA from different fractions, to assess the translational efficiency of the expressed genes. Analysis of GC regulation in ribosome-bound fractions versus transcriptional regulation revealed no significant differences, i.e., GC did not entail a significant shift between ribosomal bound and unbound mRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we analyzed for the first time possible effects of GC on the translational efficiency of expressed genes in two chALL model systems employing whole genome polysome profiling. Our results did not reveal significant differences in translational efficiency of expressed genes thereby arguing against a potential widespread regulatory effect of GCs on translation at least in the investigated in vitro systems.","['Aneichyk, Tatsiana', 'Bindreither, Daniel', 'Mantinger, Christine', 'Grazio, Daniela', 'Goetsch, Katrin', 'Kofler, Reinhard', 'Rainer, Johannes']","['Aneichyk T', 'Bindreither D', 'Mantinger C', 'Grazio D', 'Goetsch K', 'Kofler R', 'Rainer J']","['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck 6020, Austria. johannes.rainer@i-med.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131201,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Human', 'Glucocorticoids/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptome']",PMC4046653,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-14-844 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-14-844 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2013 Dec 1;14:844. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-14-844.,,,,,['W 1101/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evidence for efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the mortality rates and the incidence of bacterial infections was also reported by a systematic review published by Cochrane in 2012. The objective of our study was to report the incidence and the etiology of bloodstream infections in patients with AML undergoing levofloxacin prophylaxis during neutropenic episodes. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with diagnosis of AML during 2001-2007. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients were included in the study. Two hundred and ninetyone neutropenic episodes were studied, of which 181 were febrile. Bacteria isolated from blood cultures were mostly Gram-positives during the induction (80%) and Gram-negatives during the consolidation (72.4%) phases of chemotherapy. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 78.9% of isolated E. coli and it was higher during consolidation and higher than the hospital rate. The production of extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) in E. coli strains was reported in 12.1%, below the reported hospital rate during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Regular microbiology surveillance is needed to better understand the impact of levofloxacin prophylaxis in neutropenic patients. Our study shows that Gram-positive bacteria are predominant during the induction phase of chemotherapy and Gram-negatives during the consolidation. The rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in the latter setting, even higher than the hospital rate, may suggest to reconsider levofloxacin prophylaxis.","['De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe', 'Motta, Ilaria', 'Audisio, Ernesta', 'Frairia, Chiara', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Di Perri, Giovanni', 'Marmont, Filippo']","['De Rosa FG', 'Motta I', 'Audisio E', 'Frairia C', 'Busca A', 'Di Perri G', 'Marmont F']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Infectious Diseases, Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, University of Turin, Corso Svizzera 164, 10149 Turin, Italy. francescogiuseppe.derosa@unito.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131201,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Fluoroquinolones)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Bacteria/classification/drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Ciprofloxacin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Levofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC4219399,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-13-563 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-13-563 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2013 Dec 1;13:563. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-13-563.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytolytic antibody is directed against CD52 and depletes lymphocytes, with monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells and a subpopulation of granulocytes being affected to a much lesser degree. Alemtuzumab is currently under review to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, based on positive Phase II and Phase III trials in both treatment-naive and treated relapsing MS patients. There was excellent efficacy in suppressing both clinical and neuroimaging disease activities. In these trials, the comparator arm was not placebo, but high dose frequently dosed subcutaneous interferon beta 1a. Alemtuzumab has recently been approved by the European authorities for active relapsing MS, in essence as a first-line agent. It produces long-standing effects, consistent with an induction agent. Efficacy will have to be weighed against risk of adverse effects, which include autoimmune disorders and infection. Alemtuzumab joins an increasingly crowded market, and will add to the complexity of treating MS. AREAS COVERED: This review will discuss alemtuzumab as a therapy for MS, reviewing PubMed for clinical trials, publications and presentations at international meetings. It will focus on a United States market perspective. EXPERT OPINION: Alemtuzumab offers induction strategy for very active relapsing MS patients who have failed conventional therapy, and possibly selected treatment-naive patients. Alemtuzumab use is likely to be restricted to specialized MS centers, with long-term monitoring to determine the true risk for adverse effects.","['Coyle, Patricia Katherine']",['Coyle PK'],"['MS Comprehensive Care Center, Stony Brook University, Department of Neurology , Stony Brook, NY 11794-8121 , USA +1 631 444 8188 ; +1 631 444 1474 ; Patricia.Coyle@stonybrookmedicine.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131202,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Patient Selection', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2014.866084 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2014 Jan;14(1):127-35. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2014.866084.

Unfortunately, the exploration of the consequences on the phenotypes of each individual mutation remains a considerable challenge. RESULTS: The wKinMut web-server offers direct prediction of the potential pathogenicity of the mutations from a number of methods, including our recently developed prediction method based on the combination of information from a range of diverse sources, including physicochemical properties and functional annotations from FireDB and Swissprot and kinase-specific characteristics such as the membership to specific kinase groups, the annotation with disease-associated GO terms or the occurrence of the mutation in PFAM domains, and the relevance of the residues in determining kinase subfamily specificity from S3Det. This predictor yields interesting results that compare favourably with other methods in the field when applied to protein kinases.Together with the predictions, wKinMut offers a number of integrated services for the analysis of mutations. These include: the classification of the kinase, information about associations of the kinase with other proteins extracted from iHop, the mapping of the mutations onto PDB structures, pathogenicity records from a number of databases and the classification of mutations in large-scale cancer studies. Importantly, wKinMut is connected with the SNP2L system that extracts mentions of mutations directly from the literature, and therefore increases the possibilities of finding interesting functional information associated to the studied mutations. CONCLUSIONS: wKinMut facilitates the exploration of the information available about individual mutations by integrating prediction approaches with the automatic extraction of information from the literature (text mining) and several state-of-the-art databases.wKinMut has been used during the last year for the analysis of the consequences of mutations in the context of a number of cancer genome projects, including the recent analysis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cases and is publicly available at http://wkinmut.bioinfo.cnio.es.","['Izarzugaza, Jose M G', 'Vazquez, Miguel', 'del Pozo, Angela', 'Valencia, Alfonso']","['Izarzugaza JM', 'Vazquez M', 'del Pozo A', 'Valencia A']","['Structural Biology and BioComputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), C/Melchor Fernandez Almagro, 3, E-28029 Madrid, Spain. josemgizarzugaza@cbs.dtu.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131129,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Protein/trends', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/etiology/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Kinases/*chemistry/classification/genetics', 'Protein Stability']",PMC3879071,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-14-345 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-14-345 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2013 Nov 29;14:345. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-14-345.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although typically benign, roughly 2%-5% display malignant pathological features. The key molecular pathways involved in malignant transformation remain to be determined. METHODS: Illumina expression microarrays were used to assess gene expression levels, and Illumina single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays were used to identify copy number variants in benign, atypical, and malignant meningiomas (19 tumors, including 4 malignant ones). The authors also reanalyzed 2 expression data sets generated on Affymetrix microarrays (n = 68, including 6 malignant ones; n = 56, including 3 malignant ones). A weighted gene coexpression network approach was used to identify coexpression modules associated with malignancy. RESULTS: At the genomic level, malignant meningiomas had more chromosomal losses than atypical and benign meningiomas, with average length of 528, 203, and 34 megabases, respectively. Monosomic loss of chromosome 22 was confirmed to be one of the primary chromosomal level abnormalities in all subtypes of meningiomas. At the transcriptome level, the authors identified 23 coexpression modules from the weighted gene coexpression network. Gene functional enrichment analysis highlighted a module with 356 genes that was highly related to tumorigenesis. Four intramodular hubs within the module (GAB2, KLF2, ID1, and CTF1) were oncogenic in other cancers such as leukemia. A putative meningioma tumor suppressor MN1 was also identified in this module with differential expression between malignant and benign meningiomas. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' genomic and transcriptome analysis of meningiomas provides novel insights into the molecular pathways involved in malignant transformation of meningiomas, with implications for molecular heterogeneity of the disease.","['Chang, Xiao', 'Shi, Lingling', 'Gao, Fan', 'Russin, Jonathan', 'Zeng, Liyun', 'He, Shuhan', 'Chen, Thomas C', 'Giannotta, Steven L', 'Weisenberger, Daniel J', 'Zada, Gabriel', 'Wang, Kai', 'Mack, William J']","['Chang X', 'Shi L', 'Gao F', 'Russin J', 'Zeng L', 'He S', 'Chen TC', 'Giannotta SL', 'Weisenberger DJ', 'Zada G', 'Wang K', 'Mack WJ']","['Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neurosurg Focus,Neurosurgical focus,100896471,,IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Meningioma/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2014/07/24 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3171/2013.10.FOCUS13326 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosurg Focus. 2013 Dec;35(6):E3. doi: 10.3171/2013.10.FOCUS13326.,,,,,['KL2RR031991/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

While some patients have indolent disease for many years, 20-30% will progress and ultimately die of their disease. CLL may be classified by the Rai or Binet staging system, mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain gene (IGVH), ZAP-70 overexpression, cytogenetic abnormalities (13q-, + 12, 11q-, 17p-) and expression of several cell surface antigens (CD38, CD49d) that correlate with risk of disease progression. However, none of these markers identify all cases of CLL at risk. In a recent review, we summarized those CD antigens known to correlate with the prognosis of CLL. The present study has identified surface profiles of CD antigens that distinguish clinically progressive CLL from slow-progressive and stable CLL. Using an extended DotScan() CLL antibody microarray (Version 3; 182 CD antibodies), and with refined analysis of purified CD19 + B-cells, the following 27 CD antigens were differentially abundant for progressive CLL: CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD19, CD20 (two epitopes), CD21, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD25, CD38, CD40, CD43, CD45, CD45RA, CD52, CD69, CD81, CD84, CD98, CD102, CD148, CD180, CD196 and CD270. The extensive surface profiles obtained provide disease signatures with an accuracy of 79.2%, a sensitivity of 83.9% and a specificity of 72.5% that could provide the basis for a rapid test to triage patients with CLL according to probability of clinical progression and potential earlier requirement for treatment.","['Huang, Pauline Y', 'Best, Oliver G', 'Almazi, Juhura G', 'Belov, Larissa', 'Davis, Zadie A', 'Majid, Aneela', 'Dyer, Martin J', 'Pascovici, Dana', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Christopherson, Richard I']","['Huang PY', 'Best OG', 'Almazi JG', 'Belov L', 'Davis ZA', 'Majid A', 'Dyer MJ', 'Pascovici D', 'Mulligan SP', 'Christopherson RI']","['School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney , Sydney, NSW , Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140124,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2013/12/03 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.867486 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Sep;55(9):2085-92. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.867486.

Our objective was to determine if children with DS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a different risk of infection when treated with chemotherapy protocols developed for children with DS compared to AML treatment protocols developed for children without DS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study that included DS children </= 18 years of age with de novo, non-M3 AML diagnosed between January 1995 and December 2004, and treated at 15 Canadian centers. Patients were monitored for infection from initiation of AML treatment until recovery from the last cycle of chemotherapy, conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, relapse, persistent disease or death (whichever occurred first). Trained research associates abstracted all information from each site. RESULTS: There were 31 children with DS included; median age was 1.7 (range 0.1-11.1) years. Eleven were treated according to a DS-specific protocol while 20 were treated with non-DS specific protocols. A total of 157 courses of chemotherapy were delivered. Microbiologically documented sterile site infection occurred in 11.9% and 14.3% of DS-specific and non-DS specific AML treatment courses respectively. Sepsis was rare and there were no infection-related deaths. In multiple regression, treatment with a DS-specific protocol was independently associated with a reduction in microbiologically documented sterile site infection (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.99; P = 0.044), and clinically documented infection (adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.91; P = 0.031) but not bacteremia (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44-1.22; P = 0.231). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that children with DS do not experience excessive infectious toxicity during treatment for AML compared to children without DS. Incorporation of DS-specific AML treatment protocols is associated with a more favorable infection profile for children with DS-AML.","['Tran, Thai Hoa', 'Mitchell, David', 'Dix, David', 'Cellot, Sonia', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Gillmeister, Biljana', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Yanofsky, Rochelle', 'Johnston, Donna L', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Price, Victoria', 'Zelcer, Shayna', 'Silva, Mariana', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Bowes, Lynette', 'Stobart, Kent', 'Brossard, Josee', 'Beyene, Joseph', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Tran TH', 'Mitchell D', 'Dix D', 'Cellot S', 'Ethier MC', 'Gillmeister B', 'Hitzler J', 'Lewis V', 'Yanofsky R', 'Johnston DL', 'Portwine C', 'Price V', 'Zelcer S', 'Silva M', 'Michon B', 'Bowes L', 'Stobart K', 'Brossard J', 'Beyene J', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131202,England,Infect Agent Cancer,Infectious agents and cancer,101276559,,,,PMC4174901,2013/12/03 06:00,2013/12/03 06:01,['2013/12/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/03 06:01 [medline]']","['1750-9378-8-47 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-9378-8-47 [doi]']",epublish,Infect Agent Cancer. 2013 Dec 2;8(1):47. doi: 10.1186/1750-9378-8-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is practical and helpful to detect the fusion genes in clinic diagnosis of leukemia. Present application of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to detect the fusion gene transcripts is effective, but time- and labor-consuming. To set up a simple and rapid system, we established a method that combined multiplex RT-PCR and microarray. We selected 15 clinically most frequently observed chromosomal rearrangements generating more than 50 fusion gene variants. Chimeric reverse primers and chimeric PCR primers containing both gene-specific and universal sequences were applied in the procedure of multiplex RT-PCR, and then the PCR products hybridized with a designed microarray. With this approach, among 200 clinic samples, 63 samples were detected to have gene rearrangements. All the detected fusion genes positive and negative were validated with RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Our data suggested that the RT-PCR-microarray pipeline could screen 15 partner gene pairs simultaneously at the same accuracy of the fusion gene detection with regular RT-PCR.

Herein, we report the incorporation of MTX as a building block in an NCP formulation with exceptionally high drug loadings (up to 79.1 wt%) and the selective delivery of the NCP to cancer cells. Encapsulation of the NCP in a functionalized lipid bilayer allows for targeted delivery and controlled release to cancer cells. A phosphor can be doped into the NCPs for monitoring particle uptake by optical imaging.

Serum free light chains (sFLC), the most commonly detected paraprotein in CLL, were recently proposed as useful tools for the prognostication of CLL patients. Objective. To investigate the prognostic implication of sFLC and the summated FLC-kappa plus FLC-lambda in a CLL patients' series. Patients and Methods. We studied 143 CLL patients of which 18 were symptomatic and needed treatment, while 37 became symptomatic during follow-up. Seventy-two percent, 18%, and 10% were in Binet stage A, B and C, respectively. Median patients' followup was 32 months (range 4-228). Results. Increased involved (restricted) sFLC (iFLC) was found in 42% of patients, while the summated FLC-kappa plus FLC-lambda was above 60 mg/dL in 14%. Increased sFLC values as well as those of summated FLC above 60 were related to shorter time to treatment (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.000003, resp.) and overall survival (P = 0.05 and P = 0.003, resp.). They also correlated with beta 2-microglobulin (P = 0.009 and P = 0.03, resp.), serum albumin (P = 0.009 for summated sFLC), hemoglobin (P < 0.001), abnormal LDH (P = 0.037 and P = 0.001, resp.), Binet stage (P < 0.05) and with the presence of beta symptoms (P = 0.004 for summated sFLC). Conclusion. We confirmed the prognostic significance of sFLC in CLL regarding both time to treatment and survival and showed their relationship with other parameters.","['Sarris, Katerina', 'Maltezas, Dimitrios', 'Koulieris, Efstathios', 'Bartzis, Vassiliki', 'Tzenou, Tatiana', 'Sachanas, Sotirios', 'Nikolaou, Eftychia', 'Efthymiou, Anna', 'Bitsani, Katerina', 'Dimou, Maria', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Siakantaris, Marina', 'Angelopoulou, Maria K', 'Kontopidou, Flora', 'Tsaftaridis, Panagiotis', 'Kafasi, Nikolitsa', 'Pangalis, Gerasimos A', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis P', 'Harding, Stephen', 'Kyrtsonis, Marie-Christine']","['Sarris K', 'Maltezas D', 'Koulieris E', 'Bartzis V', 'Tzenou T', 'Sachanas S', 'Nikolaou E', 'Efthymiou A', 'Bitsani K', 'Dimou M', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Siakantaris M', 'Angelopoulou MK', 'Kontopidou F', 'Tsaftaridis P', 'Kafasi N', 'Pangalis GA', 'Panayiotidis PP', 'Harding S', 'Kyrtsonis MC']","['Hematology Section of the First Department of Propedeutic Internal Medicine, Laikon University Hospital, Agiou Thoma 17, 11527 Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131029,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,PMC3830760,2013/11/30 06:00,2013/11/30 06:01,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/359071 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2013;2013:359071. doi: 10.1155/2013/359071.

The regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation at its ser727 binding site, possible crosstalk with intracellular MAPK signaling, and their functional implications are the object of the present investigation. JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells were cultured in presence/absence of LIF and the specific ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126). Phosphorylation of signaling molecules (p-STAT3 (ser727 and tyr705) and p-ERK1/2 (thr 202/tyr 204)) was assessed per Western blot. Immunocytochemistry confirmed results, but also pinpointed the location of phosphorylated signaling molecules. STAT3 DNA-binding capacity was studied with a colorimetric ELISA-based assay. Cell viability and invasion capability were assessed by MTS and Matrigel assays. Our results demonstrate that LIF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (tyr705 and ser727) is significantly increased after blocking ERK1/2. STAT3 DNA-binding capacity and cell invasiveness are enhanced after LIF stimulation and ERK1/2 blockage. In contrast, proliferation is enhanced by LIF but reduced after ERK1/2 inhibition. The findings herein show that blocking ERK1/2 increases LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 DNA-binding capacity by an intranuclear crosstalk, which leads to enhanced invasiveness and reduced proliferation.","['Morales-Prieto, Diana M', 'Ospina-Prieto, Stephanie', 'Chaiwangyen, Wittaya', 'Weber, Maja', 'Holters, Sebastian', 'Schleussner, Ekkehard', 'Fitzgerald, Justine S', 'Markert, Udo R']","['Morales-Prieto DM', 'Ospina-Prieto S', 'Chaiwangyen W', 'Weber M', 'Holters S', 'Schleussner E', 'Fitzgerald JS', 'Markert UR']","['Placenta Lab, Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Jena, Bachstrasse 18, 07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131030,United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (U 0126)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Choriocarcinoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",PMC3833059,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/07/18 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/259845 [doi]'],epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2013 Oct 30;2013:259845. doi: 10.1155/2013/259845. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations in 161 patients of de novo AML including adults and children. RESULTS: NPM1 mutation was found in 21% and FLT3 mutation in 25% of the AML patients. Thirteen (8%) samples were positive for both NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations. Adult patients had significantly higher frequency of NPM1 mutation than children (25.8% versus 8.8%; P = 0.02). Further, NPM1 mutation was found to be more frequent in patients above 45 years of age (P = 0.02). NPM1 mutation was significantly associated with higher platelet count (P = 0.05) and absence of hepatosplenomegaly (P = 0.01), while FLT3/ITD mutation was associated with higher white blood count (P = 0.01). Immunophenotypically, NPM1 mutation was associated with the lack of CD34 (P < 0.001) and HLD-DR expression (P < 0.001), while FLT3/ITD mutation was positively associated with the expression of CD7 (P = 0.04). No correlation was found between NPM1 mutation and fusion gene. Interestingly, FLT3/ITD mutation was found to be inversely associated with AML/ETO fusion gene (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that distinct clinical and immunophenotypic characteristics of NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations present further insight into the molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis.","['Chauhan, Pradeep Singh', 'Ihsan, Rakhshan', 'Singh, L C', 'Gupta, Dipendra Kumar', 'Mittal, Vishakha', 'Kapur, Sujala']","['Chauhan PS', 'Ihsan R', 'Singh LC', 'Gupta DK', 'Mittal V', 'Kapur S']","['National Institute of Pathology, Indian Council of Medical Research, Safdarjung Hospital Campus, New Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131029,United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD7/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Phenotype', 'Platelet Count', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC3830788,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/06/21 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/582569 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Markers. 2013;35(5):581-8. doi: 10.1155/2013/582569.

The enhancer element-specific histone H3K4me1/2 mark is enriched at the specific FOXA1/ERalpha recruitment sites in chromatin, but the mechanism by which these enhancer marks are established in chromatin before hormone treatment is unclear. Here, we show that mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein is a key determinant that maintains permissive chromatin structure of the TFF1 enhancer region. MLL1 occupies the TFF1 enhancer region and methylates H3K4 before hormone stimulation. In vitro, MLL1 binds directly to the CpG-rich region of the TFF1 enhancer, and its binding is dependent on hypomethylation of DNA. Furthermore, the depletion of MLL1 in MCF-7 cells results in a dramatic decrease of chromatin accessibility and recruitment of FOXA1 and ERalpha to the enhancer element. Our study defines the mechanism by which MLL1 nucleates histone H3K4 methylation marks in CpG-enriched regions to maintain permissive chromatin architecture and allow FOXA1 and estrogen receptor alpha binding to transcriptional regulatory sites in breast cancer cells.","['Jeong, Kwang Won', 'Andreu-Vieyra, Claudia', 'You, Jueng Soo', 'Jones, Peter A', 'Stallcup, Michael R']","['Jeong KW', 'Andreu-Vieyra C', 'You JS', 'Jones PA', 'Stallcup MR']","['Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon 406-840, Republic of Korea, Departments of Urology and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9176, USA, Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, Republic of Korea and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9176, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131127,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (TFF1 protein, human)', '0 (Trefoil Factor-1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'CpG Islands', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Trefoil Factor-1', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",PMC3936730,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/05/08 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt1236 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt1236 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Feb;42(4):2245-56. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt1236.

In this prospective, we will summarize the current viewpoints on the regulation and biological significance of cPML and discuss the important questions that still need to be further answered.","['Jin, Guoxiang', 'Gao, Yuan', 'Lin, Hui-Kuan']","['Jin G', 'Gao Y', 'Lin HK']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleolus/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24727 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2014 May;115(5):812-8. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24727.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CANCER', 'CYTOPLASMIC PML', 'TUMOR SUPPRESSOR']",,,,"['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In order to identify factors influencing BSI recurrence (R-BSI) during subsequent phases of treatment, we analyzed all BSIs occurring to consecutively treated AL patients during a period of active epidemiologic surveillance at our institution between 2004 and 2011. Two hundred and fifty BSIs were observed in 138 patients receiving more than 1 cycle of chemotherapy. BSI due to the same pathogen recurred in 39/138 (28.3 %) patients. Gram-negative rods (GNRs) accounted for 59.6 % and Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) for 34.4 % of BSI. Four pathogens were involved in R-BSI: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Streptococcus viridans. GNRs were significantly more frequent among R-BSI compared to non-relapsing BSI (nR-BSI) [69/94 (73.4 %) vs 70/156 (50.6 %), p < 0.0001]; in particular, E. coli accounted for 67 % of R-BSI vs 32.1 % of nR-BSI (p < 0.0001). Receiving more than four chemotherapy courses and having an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli BSI at any time of treatment were significantly associated to R-BSI. A trend toward a higher mortality among R-BSI patients in comparison with nR-BSI was observed (17.9 and 7.1 %, respectively, p = 0.12). Among AL patients, R-BSI is a frequent phenomenon, which may contribute to the shift of epidemiology toward GNR and to a higher mortality. This should significantly impact the strategies of antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment in patients with AL.","['Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Antoniazzi, Francesca', 'Tumbarello, Mario', 'Skert, Cristina', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Schieppati, Francesca', 'Cerqui, Elisa', 'Pagani, Chiara', 'Petulla, Marta', 'Re, Alessandro', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Cattaneo C', 'Antoniazzi F', 'Tumbarello M', 'Skert C', 'Borlenghi E', 'Schieppati F', 'Cerqui E', 'Pagani C', 'Petulla M', 'Re A', 'Rossi G']","['Department of Hematology, Spedali Civili, 25123, Brescia, Italy, chiara.cattaneo@libero.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131128,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/*microbiology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/complications/*microbiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/drug effects/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Recurrence', 'Staphylococcus/drug effects/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Viridans Streptococci/drug effects/isolation & purification/physiology', 'beta-Lactamases/metabolism']",,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/05/30 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1965-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 May;93(5):785-90. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1965-0.

We based our screening on a combined analytical and bio-guided approach of LC-DAD-HRMS dereplication, explorative solid-phase extraction (E-SPE), and a co-culture platform of CLL and stromal cells. A total of 289 fungal extracts were screened and we tracked the activity to single compounds in seven of the most active extracts. The novel ophiobolin U was isolated together with the known ophiobolins C, H, K as well as 6-epiophiobolins G, K and N from three fungal strains in the Aspergillus section Usti. Ophiobolins A, B, C and K displayed bioactivity towards leukemia cells with induction of apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations. The remaining ophiobolins were mainly inactive or only slightly active at micromolar concentrations. Dereplication of those ophiobolin derivatives possessing different activity in combination with structural analysis allowed a correlation of the chemical structure and conformation with the extent of bioactivity, identifying the hydroxy group at C3 and an aldehyde at C21, as well as the A/B-cis ring structure, as indispensible for the strong activity of the ophiobolins.

METHODS: Prospectively, cumulative fracture incidence, calculated from diagnosis until one year after cessation of treatment, was assessed in 672 patients. This fracture incidence was compared between subgroups of treatment stratification and age subgroups (Log-Rank test). Serial measurements of bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (BMDLS) were performed in 399 ALL patients using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. We evaluated risk factors for a low BMD (multivariate regression analysis). Osteoporosis was defined as a BMDLS</=-2 SDS combined with clinical significant fractures. RESULTS: The 3-year cumulative fracture incidence was 17.8%. At diagnosis, mean BMDLS of ALL patients was lower than of healthy peers (mean BMDLS=-1.10 SDS, P<0.001), and remained lower during/after treatment (8months: BMDLS=-1.10 SDS, P<0.001; 24months: BMDLS=-1.27 SDS, P<0.001; 36months: BMDLS=-0.95 SDS, P<0.001). Younger age, lower weight and B-cell-immunophenotype were associated with a lower BMDLS at diagnosis. After correction for weight, height, gender and immunophenotype, stratification to the high risk (HR)-protocol arm and older age lead to a larger decline of BMDLS (HR group: beta=-0.52, P<0.01; age: beta=-0.16, P<0.001). Cumulative fracture incidences were not different between ALL risk groups and age groups. Patients with fractures had a lower BMDLS during treatment than those without fractures. Treatment-related bone loss was similar in patients with and without fractures (respectively: DeltaBMDLS=-0.36 SDS and DeltaBMDLS=-0.12 SDS; interaction group time, P=0.30). Twenty of the 399 patients (5%) met the criteria of osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: Low values of BMDLS at diagnosis and during treatment, rather than the treatment-related decline of BMDLS, determine the increased fracture risk of 17.8% in children with ALL.","['te Winkel, Mariel L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Hop, Wim C J', 'Roos, Jan C', 'Bokkerink, Jos P M', 'Leeuw, Jan A', 'Bruin, Marrie C A', 'Kollen, Wouter J W', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester A', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['te Winkel ML', 'Pieters R', 'Hop WC', 'Roos JC', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Leeuw JA', 'Bruin MC', 'Kollen WJ', 'Veerman AJ', 'de Groot-Kruseman HA', 'van der Sluis IM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Erasmus MC - University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands; Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Medical Center St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', ""Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands; Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands; Department of Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands; Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.

As triggers in disease frequently include combined increases in inflammatory cytokine and reactive oxygen species levels, we report here how oxidative stress impacts on cytokine-driven STAT3 signal transduction events. In the model system of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), combined treatment with the interleukin-6 family cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) drove persistent STAT3 phosphorylation whereas STAT3 phosphorylation increased only transiently in response to LIF alone and was not increased by H2O2 alone. Surprisingly, increases in transcript levels of the direct STAT3 gene target SOCS3 were delayed during the combined LIF + H2O2 treatment, leading us to probe the impact of oxidative stress on STAT3 regulatory events. Indeed, LIF + H2O2 prolonged JAK activation, delayed STAT3 nuclear localisation, and caused relocalisation of nuclear STAT3 phosphatase TC-PTP (TC45) to the cytoplasm. In exploring the nuclear import/ export pathways, we observed disruption of nuclear/cytoplasmic distributions of Ran and importin-alpha3 in cells exposed to H2O2 and the resultant reduced nuclear trafficking of Classical importin-alpha/3-dependent protein cargoes. CRM1-mediated nuclear export persisted despite the oxidative stress insult, with sustained STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation enhancing STAT3 nuclear residency. Our studies thus reveal for the first time the striking impact of oxidative stress to sustain STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear retention following disruption of multiple regulatory events, with significant implications for STAT3 function.","['Ng, Ivan H W', 'Yeap, Yvonne Y C', 'Ong, Lynette S R', 'Jans, David A', 'Bogoyevitch, Marie A']","['Ng IH', 'Yeap YY', 'Ong LS', 'Jans DA', 'Bogoyevitch MA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00407-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.11.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014 Mar;1843(3):483-94. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.11.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since most statistical methods for expression analysis are focused on differences between experimental groups, the performance of approaches for patient-specific expression analyses are currently less well characterized. A comparison of methods for the identification of genes that are dysregulated relative to a single sample in a given set of experimental samples, to our knowledge, has not been performed. METHODS: We systematically evaluated several methods including variations on the nearest neighbor based outlying degree method, as well as the Zscore and a robust variant for their suitability to detect patient-specific events. The methods were assessed using both simulations and expression data from a cohort of pediatric acute B lymphoblastic leukemia patients. RESULTS: We first assessed power and false discovery rates using simulations and found that even under optimal conditions, high effect sizes (>4 unit differences) were necessary to have acceptable power for any method (>0.9) though high false discovery rates (>0.1) were pervasive across simulation conditions. Next we introduced a technical factor into the simulation and found that performance was reduced for all methods and that using weights with the outlying degree could provide performance gains depending on the number of samples and genes affected by the technical factor. In our use case that highlights the integration of functional assays and aberrant expression in a patient cohort (the identification of gene dysregulation events associated with the targets from a siRNA screen), we demonstrated that both the outlying degree and the Zscore can successfully identify genes dysregulated in one patient sample. However, only the outlying degree can identify genes dysregulated across several patient samples. CONCLUSION: Our results show that outlying degree methods may be a useful alternative to the Zscore or Rscore in a personalized medicine context especially in small to medium sized (between 10 and 50 samples) expression datasets with moderate to high sample-to-sample variability. From these results we provide guidelines for detection of aberrant expression in a precision medicine context.","['Bottomly, Daniel', 'Ryabinin, Peter A', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Druker, Brian J', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Wilmot, Beth']","['Bottomly D', 'Ryabinin PA', 'Tyner JW', 'Chang BH', 'Loriaux MM', 'Druker BJ', 'McWeeney SK', 'Wilmot B']","['Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Department of Cell & Developmental Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Department of Anatomic Pathology, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, DMICE, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Division of Biostatistics, PHPM, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA ; Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, DMICE, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131129,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,PMC3971350,2013/11/30 06:00,2013/11/30 06:01,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/gm509 [doi]', 'gm509 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2013 Nov 29;5(11):103. doi: 10.1186/gm509. eCollection 2013.,,,,,"['P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA151457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY SELECTION: The publications about the characteristics of Tregs, ex vivo expansion of Tregs and clinical applications of Tregs against GVHD were identified, retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Tregs can be classified as natural Tregs (nTregs) and induced Tregs (iTregs). Both subsets share most Treg features. Given their immunosuppressive property, Tregs have been tested for their capability of preventing GVHD. The bottleneck of Treg therapy is the limited numbers of naturally existing Tregs. To solve this problem, ex vivo expansion of nTregs or iTregs has been executed. The initial data indicate Treg therapy is effective in reducing GVHD without compromising graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). CONCLUSION: Ex vivo expansion of Tregs is a reliable way to prepare sufficient number of Tregs for management of GVHD.","['Zhang, Lan-fang', 'Xia, Chang-qing']","['Zhang LF', 'Xia CQ']","['Department of Hematology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100053, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology']",,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/06/26 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2013 Dec;126(23):4575-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Demethylating agent decitabine was reported to be able to up-regulate CTAs through its hypomethylation mechanism, thus enhance the immunogenicity of leukemia cells. However, few researches have ever focused on the questions that whether this immunostimulatory effect of decitabine could induce autologous CTA specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vivo, and if so, whether this effect contributes to disease control. In this study, we aimed to show that decitabine could induce specific autologous CTLs against some mouse CTAs in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Several mouse CTAs were screened by RT-PCR. CTL specific to one of the CTAs named P1A was detected and sorted by P1A specific dimer by flow cytometry. The activity of specific CTLs was measured by real time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We firstly screened expression of some CTAs in mouse leukemia cells before and after decitabine treatment and found that decitabine treatment did up-regulate expression of many CTAs. Then we measured the CTLs' activity specific to a mouse CTA P1A in vivo and showed that this activity increased after decitabine treatment. Finally, we sorted these in vivo induced P1A specific CTLs by flow cytometry and demonstrated their cytotoxicity against decitabine treated leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the autologous immune response induced by decitabine in vivo. And more importantly, we firstly proved that this response may contribute to disease control. We believe that this immunostimulatory effect is another anti-cancer mechanism of decitabine, and this special effect would inspire new applications of decitabine in the field of leukemia treatment in the future.","['Zhou, Ji-hao', 'Yao, Yu-shi', 'Wang, Li-xin', 'Wang, Jia', 'Li, Yong-hui', 'Jiang, Meng-meng', 'Zhou, Min-hang', 'Gao, Xiao-ning', 'Li, Rui-sheng', 'Wang, Li-li', 'Yu, Li']","['Zhou JH', 'Yao YS', 'Wang LX', 'Wang J', 'Li YH', 'Jiang MM', 'Zhou MH', 'Gao XN', 'Li RS', 'Wang LL', 'Yu L']","[""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Decitabine', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*metabolism']",,2013/11/30 06:00,2014/06/26 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2013 Dec;126(23):4552-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, in 83 (30.5%) patients, PET-CT scans used to evaluate new clinical complications localized high FDG-avidity lesions for biopsies. This resulted in clinically relevant new diagnoses in 32 patients, including those with more aggressive lymphoma (n = 16), non-hematological malignancies (n = 8) and opportunistic infections (n = 3). Twenty-seven patients had high FDG-avidity CLL, which was associated with prominent lymph node proliferation centers, an increased frequency of poor prognostic factors (17p13 deletion, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene [IGHV], expression of ZAP-70 and CD38) and a shorter overall survival. We conclude that FDG PET scans should not be used for routine surveillance of patients with CLL. However PET-CT scans are sensitive, but not specific, for detection of aggressive lymphomas, other cancers and systemic infections in patients with CLL.","['Conte, Michael J', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Wiseman, Gregory A', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Viswanatha, David S', 'Zent, Clive S']","['Conte MJ', 'Bowen DA', 'Wiseman GA', 'Rabe KG', 'Slager SL', 'Schwager SM', 'Call TG', 'Viswanatha DS', 'Zent CS']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic , Rochester, MN , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140217,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infections/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*etiology', '*Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognosis', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']",PMC4419693,2013/11/30 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2013/11/30 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.869801 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Sep;55(9):2079-84. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.869801.

Here, we show that leukemia cells require the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex for their survival and aberrant self-renewal potential. While Brg1, an ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, is known to suppress tumor formation in several cell types, we found that leukemia cells instead rely on Brg1 to support their oncogenic transcriptional program, which includes Myc as one of its key targets. To account for this context-specific function, we identify a cluster of lineage-specific enhancers located 1.7 Mb downstream from Myc that are occupied by SWI/SNF as well as the BET protein Brd4. Brg1 is required at these distal elements to maintain transcription factor occupancy and for long-range chromatin looping interactions with the Myc promoter. Notably, these distal Myc enhancers coincide with a region that is focally amplified in approximately 3% of acute myeloid leukemias. Together, these findings define a leukemia maintenance function for SWI/SNF that is linked to enhancer-mediated gene regulation, providing general insights into how cancer cells exploit transcriptional coactivators to maintain oncogenic gene expression programs.","['Shi, Junwei', 'Whyte, Warren A', 'Zepeda-Mendoza, Cinthya J', 'Milazzo, Joseph P', 'Shen, Chen', 'Roe, Jae-Seok', 'Minder, Jessica L', 'Mercan, Fatih', 'Wang, Eric', 'Eckersley-Maslin, Melanie A', 'Campbell, Amy E', 'Kawaoka, Shinpei', 'Shareef, Sarah', 'Zhu, Zhu', 'Kendall, Jude', 'Muhar, Matthias', 'Haslinger, Christian', 'Yu, Ming', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Wigler, Michael H', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Spector, David L', 'Young, Richard A', 'Vakoc, Christopher R']","['Shi J', 'Whyte WA', 'Zepeda-Mendoza CJ', 'Milazzo JP', 'Shen C', 'Roe JS', 'Minder JL', 'Mercan F', 'Wang E', 'Eckersley-Maslin MA', 'Campbell AE', 'Kawaoka S', 'Shareef S', 'Zhu Z', 'Kendall J', 'Muhar M', 'Haslinger C', 'Yu M', 'Roeder RG', 'Wigler MH', 'Blobel GA', 'Zuber J', 'Spector DL', 'Young RA', 'Vakoc CR']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (SMARCA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3877755,2013/11/29 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['gad.232710.113 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.232710.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2013 Dec 15;27(24):2648-62. doi: 10.1101/gad.232710.113.

We sought to compare health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) outcomes between these treatment groups. PROCEDURE: Five-year survivors of AML diagnosed before age 21 and enrolled and treated from 1979 to 1995 on one of 4 national protocols were interviewed. These survivors or proxy caregivers completed a health questionnaire and an HRQOL measure. RESULTS: Of 180 survivors, 100 were treated with chemotherapy only, 26 with chemotherapy followed by autoBMT, and 54 with chemotherapy followed by alloBMT. Median age at interview was 20 years (range 8-39). Twenty-one percent reported a severe or life-threatening chronic health condition (chemotherapy-only 16% vs. autoBMT 21% vs. alloBMT 33%; P = 0.02 for chemotherapy-only vs. alloBMT). Nearly all (95%) reported excellent, very good or good health. Reports of cancer-related pain and anxiety did not vary between groups. HRQOL scores among 136 participants >/=14 years of age were similar among groups and to the normative population, though alloBMT survivors had a lower physical mean summary score (49.1 alloBMT vs. 52.2 chemotherapy-only; P = 0.03). Multivariate analyses showed the presence of severe chronic health conditions to be a strong predictor of physical but not mental mean summary scores. CONCLUSIONS: Overall HRQOL scores were similar among treatment groups, although survivors reporting more health conditions or cancer-related pain had diminished HRQOL. Attention to chronic health conditions and management of cancer-related pain may improve QOL.","['Schultz, Kris Ann P', 'Chen, Lu', 'Chen, Zhengjia', 'Kawashima, Toana', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Woods, William G', 'Nicholson, H Stacy', 'Neglia, Joseph P']","['Schultz KA', 'Chen L', 'Chen Z', 'Kawashima T', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Woods WG', 'Nicholson HS', 'Neglia JP']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",PMC4190066,2013/11/29 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24881 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Apr;61(4):729-36. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24881.

Activating mutations in NRAS are prevalent in human myeloproliferative neoplasms and leukaemia. Here we show that a single allele of oncogenic Nras(G12D) increases HSC proliferation but also increases reconstituting and self-renewal potential upon serial transplantation in irradiated mice, all prior to leukaemia initiation. Nras(G12D) also confers long-term self-renewal potential to multipotent progenitors. To explore the mechanism by which Nras(G12D) promotes HSC proliferation and self-renewal, we assessed cell-cycle kinetics using H2B-GFP label retention and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Nras(G12D) had a bimodal effect on HSCs, increasing the frequency with which some HSCs divide and reducing the frequency with which others divide. This mirrored bimodal effects on reconstituting potential, as rarely dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs outcompeted wild-type HSCs, whereas frequently dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs did not. Nras(G12D) caused these effects by promoting STAT5 signalling, inducing different transcriptional responses in different subsets of HSCs. One signal can therefore increase HSC proliferation, competitiveness and self-renewal through bimodal effects on HSC gene expression, cycling and reconstituting potential.","['Li, Qing', 'Bohin, Natacha', 'Wen, Tiffany', 'Ng, Victor', 'Magee, Jeffrey', 'Chen, Shann-Ching', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Morrison, Sean J']","['Li Q', 'Bohin N', 'Wen T', 'Ng V', 'Magee J', 'Chen SC', 'Shannon K', 'Morrison SJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.', ""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Pediatrics, and Children's Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.', ""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Pediatrics, and Children's Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Time Factors']",PMC4128640,2013/11/29 06:00,2013/12/29 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/nature12830 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 2013 Dec 5;504(7478):143-147. doi: 10.1038/nature12830.

A fully functional DNA repair proteome for removing harmful DNA lesions is a prerequisite for an appropriate DNA damage response. Genetically determined failure to repair UV-induced DNA damage is associated with skin photosensitivity and increased skin cancer risk. Patients treated with immunosuppressant/anti-inflammatory thiopurines are also photosensitive and have high rates of sun-related skin cancer. Their DNA contains the base analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG), which acts as a UVA photosensitizer to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), predominantly singlet oxygen ((1)O2). ROS damage both DNA and proteins. Here we show that UVA irradiation of cultured human cells containing DNA 6-TG causes significant protein oxidation and damages components of the DNA repair proteome, including the Ku, OGG-1, MYH, and RPA proteins. Assays of DNA repair in intact cells or in cell extracts indicate that this protein damage compromises DNA break rejoining and base and nucleotide excision repair. As these experimental conditions simulate those in the skin of patients taking thiopurines, our findings suggest a mechanism whereby UVA in sunlight may contribute to skin carcinogenesis in immunosuppressed patients.","['Gueranger, Quentin', 'Li, Feng', 'Peacock, Matthew', 'Larnicol-Fery, Annabel', 'Brem, Reto', 'Macpherson, Peter', 'Egly, Jean-Marc', 'Karran, Peter']","['Gueranger Q', 'Li F', 'Peacock M', 'Larnicol-Fery A', 'Brem R', 'Macpherson P', 'Egly JM', 'Karran P']","['Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Herts, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Herts, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Herts, UK.', 'Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/Inserm/ULP, BP163, Strasbourg, France.', 'Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Herts, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Herts, UK.', 'Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/Inserm/ULP, BP163, Strasbourg, France.', 'Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Herts, UK.

More effective drug design requires an expanded view of the molecular complexity that underlies AML. Alternative splicing of RNA is used by normal cells to generate protein diversity. Growing evidence indicates that aberrant splicing of genes plays a key role in cancer. We investigated genome-wide splicing abnormalities in AML and based on these abnormalities, we aimed to identify novel potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used genome-wide alternative splicing screening to investigate alternative splicing abnormalities in two independent AML patient cohorts [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) (Boston, MA) and University Hospital de Nantes (UHN) (Nantes, France)] and normal donors. Selected splicing events were confirmed through cloning and sequencing analysis, and than validated in 193 patients with AML. RESULTS: Our results show that approximately 29% of expressed genes genome-wide were differentially and recurrently spliced in patients with AML compared with normal donors bone marrow CD34(+) cells. Results were reproducible in two independent AML cohorts. In both cohorts, annotation analyses indicated similar proportions of differentially spliced genes encoding several oncogenes, tumor suppressor proteins, splicing factors, and heterogeneous-nuclear-ribonucleoproteins, proteins involved in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and spliceosome assembly. Our findings are consistent with reports for other malignances and indicate that AML-specific aberrations in splicing mechanisms are a hallmark of AML pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest that aberrant splicing is a common characteristic for AML. Our findings also suggest that splice variant transcripts that are the result of splicing aberrations create novel disease markers and provide potential targets for small molecules or antibody therapeutics for this disease.","['Adamia, Sophia', 'Haibe-Kains, Benjamin', 'Pilarski, Patrick M', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Pevzner, Samuel', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Lode, Laurence', 'Verselis, Sigitas', 'Fox, Edward A', 'Burke, John', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Dagogo-Jack, Ibiayi', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Steensma, David P', 'Motyckova, Gabriela', 'Deangelo, Daniel J', 'Quackenbush, John', 'Stone, Richard', 'Griffin, James D']","['Adamia S', 'Haibe-Kains B', 'Pilarski PM', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Pevzner S', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Lode L', 'Verselis S', 'Fox EA', 'Burke J', 'Galinsky I', 'Dagogo-Jack I', 'Wadleigh M', 'Steensma DP', 'Motyckova G', 'Deangelo DJ', 'Quackenbush J', 'Stone R', 'Griffin JD']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics Laboratory, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston University School of Medicine and Biomedical Engineering Department, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts; Unite de Genomique du Myelome, Laboratoire UGM, University Hospital, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France; Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital; and INSERM U892, Nantes, France; Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts; Biotique Systems Inc., www.biotiquesystems.com; Adult Leukemia Program, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CD13 Antigens/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*RNA Splicing', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4458245,2013/11/29 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-0956 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0956 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Mar 1;20(5):1135-45. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0956.

XPD is one of the DNA repair proteins, whose genetic polymorphisms are thought to affect their function as regards response to chemotherapeutic drugs and chemotherapy-induced toxicities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated the XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 51 newly diagnosed cytogenetically normal de novo AML patients. The response to the standard induction chemotherapy protocol and chemotherapy-induced toxicities were monitored. RESULTS: The XPD Asp312Asn GG genotype was the most frequent (57%) followed by the GA variant (37%), and the AA variant was the least frequent (6%). As regards the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism, the AA genotype was the most frequent (49%), followed by the AC (39%) and CC (12%) variants. These variants were not associated with age, sex, FAB subtype, CNS infiltration, chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or metabolic toxicity. The XPD Lys751Gln CC polymorphic variant was associated with chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and lower chance to achieve response to induction chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: XPD Lys751Gln and not Asp312Asn polymorphism was associated with chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and response to induction chemotherapy in newly diagnosed cytogenetically normal AML patients. Pretreatment assay of XPD Lys751Gln may help to anticipate cardiotoxicity in those at risk. Moreover, it may be considered a prognostic marker in AML cases. However, further large scale research is needed to verify its usefulness.","['El-Tokhy, Mervat A', 'Hussein, Neveen A', 'Bedewy, Ahmed M L', 'Barakat, Mohammad R']","['El-Tokhy MA', 'Hussein NA', 'Bedewy AM', 'Barakat MR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131128,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['EC 3.6.4.12 (Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein)', 'EC 5.99.- (ERCC2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/etiology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2013/11/29 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['hem329_1385532905972 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000144 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Oct;19(7):397-403. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000144.

Moreover, CK2 role in blood tumors is rapidly emerging and this kinase has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target. Phase I clinical trials with the oral small ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 are currently ongoing in solid tumors and multiple myeloma. METHODS: We have analyzed the expression of CK2 in acute myeloid leukemia and its function in cell growth and in the response to the chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin We employed acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary blasts from patients grouped according to the European LeukemiaNet risk classification. Cell survival, apoptosis and sensitivity to daunorubicin were assessed by different means. p53-dependent CK2-inhibition-induced apoptosis was investigated in p53 wild-type and mutant cells. RESULTS: CK2a was found highly expressed in the majority of samples across the different acute myeloid leukemia prognostic subgroups as compared to normal CD34+ hematopoietic and bone marrow cells. Inhibition of CK2 with CX-4945, K27 or siRNAs caused a p53-dependent acute myeloid leukemia cell apoptosis. CK2 inhibition was associated with a synergistic increase of the cytotoxic effects of daunorubicin. Baseline and daunorubicin-induced STAT3 activation was hampered upon CK2 blockade. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CK2 is over expressed across the different acute myeloid leukemia subsets and acts as an important regulator of acute myeloid leukemia cell survival. CK2 negative regulation of the protein levels of tumor suppressor p53 and activation of the STAT3 anti-apoptotic pathway might antagonize apoptosis and could be involved in acute myeloid leukemia cell resistance to daunorubicin.","['Quotti Tubi, Laura', 'Gurrieri, Carmela', 'Brancalion, Alessandra', 'Bonaldi, Laura', 'Bertorelle, Roberta', 'Manni, Sabrina', 'Pavan, Laura', 'Lessi, Federica', 'Zambello, Renato', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Adami, Fausto', 'Ruzzene, Maria', 'Pinna, Lorenzo A', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Piazza, Francesco']","['Quotti Tubi L', 'Gurrieri C', 'Brancalion A', 'Bonaldi L', 'Bertorelle R', 'Manni S', 'Pavan L', 'Lessi F', 'Zambello R', 'Trentin L', 'Adami F', 'Ruzzene M', 'Pinna LA', 'Semenzato G', 'Piazza F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131012,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Phenazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'C6RWP0N0L2 (silmitasertib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CSNK2A1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Naphthyridines/*pharmacology', 'Phenazines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC3852751,2013/11/29 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-78 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-78 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Oct 12;6:78. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a heterogeneous disease featuring cytogenetic aberrations, recurrent somatic mutations and alterations in gene expression. DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) is closely associated with epigenetic modifications in mammalian development and disease. More recent studies have identified recurrent somatic mutations in DNMT3A in AML, most of which are heterozygous. The DNMT3A R882 codon is a mutational hotspot. The frequency of DNMT3A mutations varies among different countries, but mutations have been found to be associated with cytogenetics, age, white blood cell (WBC) count, prognosis and response of patients to chemotherapy. The normal function of DNMT3A can be disrupted by these mutations, which subsequently results in an abnormality of epigenetic modification. These data suggest that mutations in the DNMT3A gene represent a novel class of mutations in AML with distinct biological and clinical features. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact molecular mechanism and function of DNMT3A mutations in leukemogenesis.","['Li, Yunlong', 'Zhu, Baosheng']","['Li Y', 'Zhu B']","['Medical Faculty, Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology , Kunming, Yunnan , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140307,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis']",,2013/11/29 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.869802 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Sep;55(9):2002-12. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.869802.

We found that RTX significantly increases APO866-induced death in lymphoma cells from patients and lines. Mechanisms include enhancement of autophagy-mediated cell death, activation of caspase 3 and exacerbation of mitochondrial depolarization, but not increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, when compared with those induced by each drug alone. In vivo, combined administration of APO866 with RTX in a laboratory model of human aggressive lymphoma significantly decreased tumor burden and prolonged survival over single-agent treatment.

Predicting disease progression is difficult due to lack of specific molecular marker(s). SALL4 plays important roles in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. SALL4 transgenic mice develop MDS prior to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. However, the role of SALL4 in human MDS has not been extensively investigated. In this study, we evaluate the diagnostic/prognostic value of SALL4 in MDS by examining its expression levels in a cohort of MDS patients. METHODS: Fifty-five newly diagnosed MDS, twenty MDS-AML, and sixteen post-treatment MDS patients were selected for our study along with ten healthy donors. RESULTS: We demonstrated that SALL4 was over-expressed in MDS patients and proportionally increased in MDS patients with high grade/IPSS scores. This expression pattern was similar to that of Bmi-1, an important marker in predicting MDS/AML progression. In addition, the level of SALL4 was positively correlated with increased blast counts, high-risk keryotypes and increased significantly in MDS-AML transformation. Furthermore, higher level of SALL4 expression was associated with worse survival rates and SALL4 level decreased following effective therapy. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series and the first to report the expression pattern of SALL4 in detail in various subtypes of MDS in comparison to that of Bmi-1. We conclude that SALL4 is a potential molecular marker in predicting the prognosis of MDS.","['Wang, Fei', 'Guo, Ye', 'Chen, Qian', 'Yang, Zhuo', 'Ning, Ning', 'Zhang, Yujuan', 'Xu, Yonggang', 'Xu, Xiaodong', 'Tong, Chunrong', 'Chai, Li', 'Cui, Wei']","['Wang F', 'Guo Y', 'Chen Q', 'Yang Z', 'Ning N', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Xu X', 'Tong C', 'Chai L', 'Cui W']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. lchai@partners.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130926,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC3856454,2013/11/29 06:00,2014/10/31 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-73 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-73 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Sep 26;6(1):73. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, since direct sequencing of the TP53 gene does not evaluate TP53 functionality, a functional assessment of TP53 pathway may be of interest to identify high risk CLL. By taking advantage of a training cohort of 100 CLL and a validation cohort of 40 CLL with different patterns of TP53 mutation/deletion by FISH and sequencing, we propose an in-vitro assay in which the modulation of TP53 protein and CDKN1A mRNA were investigated upon 24-hour exposure of CLL cells to Nutlin-3. METHODS: The functional assay was set-up on cell lines recapitulating all TP53 genotypes (EHEB, TP53(wt/wt); RAJI, TP53(mut/wt); MEC-1 and MAVER1, TP53(mut/del); HL-60, TP53(del/del)) and evaluated in two multi-institutional cohorts, purposely enriched in CLL bearing TP53 disruption: a training cohort of 100 cases and a validation cohort of 40 cases, both characterized by FISH and TP53 direct sequencing. Cells were exposed to 10 microM Nutlin-3 for 24 hours; TP53 accumulation was evaluated by Western blotting; TP53 transcriptional activity was determined by quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) of the TP53 target gene CDKN1A. RESULTS: According to TP53 protein modulation, in the training cohort we identified: (i) 63 cases (51 TP53wt/wt, 12 TP53del/wt) with absence of basal TP53 and induction after treatment (normal pattern); (ii) 18 cases (3 TP53(mut/wt), 15 TP53(mut/del)) with high basal TP53 without increase after treatment (mutant pattern); (iii) 19 cases (5 TP53(mut/wt); 3 TP53(mut/del); 11 TP53(wt/wt)) with basal TP53 that increases upon treatment (intermediate pattern). Evaluation of CDKN1A mRNA levels upon Nutlin-3 exposure showed that the 26 TP53 mutated (TP53(mut/del) or TP53(mut/wt)) cases had lower induction levels than the majority (57/63) of cases with normal pattern, and 10/12 cases with intermediate pattern without evidence of TP53 derangement by FISH and sequencing. These results were confirmed in the independent validation cohort of 40 cases (13 TP53(wt/wt), 3 TP53(del/wt), 12 TP53(mut/del), 12 TP53(mut/wt)). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed functional assay may integrate the conventional analyses for the identification of TP53 dysregulated CLL.","['Pozzo, Federico', 'Dal Bo, Michele', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Rossi, Francesca', 'Degan, Massimo', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Grossi, Alberto', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Zaja, Francesco', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Fo A, Robin', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Pozzo F', 'Dal Bo M', 'Peragine N', 'Bomben R', 'Zucchetto A', 'Rossi F', 'Degan M', 'Rossi D', 'Chiarenza A', 'Grossi A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Zaja F', 'Pozzato G', 'Secchiero P', 'Gaidano G', 'Del Poeta G', 'Zauli G', 'Fo A R', 'Guarini A', 'Gattei V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131105,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cohort Studies', '*Genes, p53', 'Genotype', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4222122,2013/11/29 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2013/11/29 06:00'],"['2013/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-83 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-83 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Nov 5;6:83. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocytic sarcoma (GS), also known as chloroma or extramedullary myeloblastoma, is a solid tumor composed of primitive precursors of the granulocytic series that include myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes. Granulocytic sarcoma is a rare tumor that may develop during acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but less frequently may precede its presentation. Although generalized lymph node enlargement is a presentation for malignant lymphoma, it can also rarely be the early presenting sign of GS. Methods. We present a case of GS mimicking lymphoma in a 45-year-old male. The patient presented with bilateral neck masses and had widespread, prominent lymphadenopathy secondary to AML as the first presenting manifestation of GS for the last 4 months with concurrent marrow AML. Result. A clinical diagnosis of lymphoma was suspected; fine needle aspiration cytology findings were also suggestive of lymphoma. However, peripheral blood and bone marrow examination reported as acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation and histopathology of excised lymph node confirmed it to be a GS not lymphoma. Conclusion. GS is often misdiagnosed as malignant lymphoma because of cytomorphologic and histologic similarities of the blasts to large cell lymphoma. A careful search for immature myeloid is a useful clue to the diagnosis accompanied with appropriate immunophenotyping.","['Elyamany, Ghaleb', 'Khan, Mohammed', 'El Hag, Imad', 'El-Zimaity, Maha', 'Albalawi, Mohamed', 'Al Abdulaaly, Abdulaziz']","['Elyamany G', 'Khan M', 'El Hag I', 'El-Zimaity M', 'Albalawi M', 'Al Abdulaaly A']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, Egypt ; Hematopathology, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, P.O.

The Mucin 1-C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) oncoprotein is aberrantly expressed in AML blasts and stem cells; however, there is no known interaction between MUC1-C and FLT3. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C associates with wild-type and mutant FLT3 in AML cells. Targeting MUC1-C with the cell-penetrating peptide inhibitor GO-203 disrupts MUC1-C/FLT3 complexes and downregulates FLT3 activation. GO-203 treatment of AML cells was also associated with inhibition of the FLT3 downstream effectors AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and STAT5. The results further show that AML cells with FLT3-activating mutations and resistant to the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin/PKC412 are sensitive to GO-203-induced growth arrest and death. Moreover, GO-203 increases sensitivity of mutant FLT3 AML cells to FLT3 inhibitor treatment. These results indicate that MUC1-C contributes to FLT3 activation in AML cells and that targeting MUC1-C inhibits the FLT3 signaling pathway. Our findings support the development of MUC1-C inhibitors alone and in combination with agents that target FLT3 for the treatment of wild-type and mutant FLT3 AML.","['Liu, Suiyang', 'Yin, Li', 'Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Rajabi, Hasan', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly', 'Avigan, David', 'Kharbanda, Surender', 'Kufe, Donald', 'Stone, Richard']","['Liu S', 'Yin L', 'Stroopinsky D', 'Rajabi H', 'Puissant A', 'Stegmaier K', 'Avigan D', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe D', 'Stone R']",['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131126,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 ((arginine)9-cysteinyl-glutaminyl-cysteinyl-arginyl-arginyl-lysyl-asparagine)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mucin-1/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3907758,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36080-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-04-493858 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jan 30;123(5):734-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-04-493858.

TREM-1 ligation on neutrophils (PMN) or monocytes results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Engagement of TREM-1 induces the activation of MAP kinases as well as rapid Ca(2+) mobilization. However, a detailed understanding of TREM-1 signaling pathways is currently lacking. We evaluated the TREM-1 signaling hierarchy in monocytic cells and found that the acute myeloid leukemia cell line MUTZ-3 expresses TREM-1 in a natural and functional manner. We compared essential signaling molecules of the TREM-1, TLR and NLR cascade in MUTZ-3 cells as well as primary monocytes or PMN by Western blot analysis. These studies confirmed the essential role of phosphatidyl inositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and p38MAPK in the TREM-1 as well as the TLR or NLR cascade of monocytic cells. Importantly, PI3K and p38MAPK signals in monocytic cells both control Ca(2+) mobilization and are directly connected in the TREM-1 signaling hierarchy, which contrasts previous results obtained in PMN. Taken together, our results indicate cell type-specific differences in the TREM-1 signaling cascade and contribute to an enhanced understanding of the regulation of innate inflammatory responses.","['Prufer, Steve', 'Weber, Michael', 'Sasca, Daniel', 'Teschner, Daniel', 'Wolfel, Catherine', 'Stein, Pamela', 'Stassen, Michael', 'Schild, Hansjorg', 'Radsak, Markus P']","['Prufer S', 'Weber M', 'Sasca D', 'Teschner D', 'Wolfel C', 'Stein P', 'Stassen M', 'Schild H', 'Radsak MP']","['Institute for Immunology, Johannes Gutenberg University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131121,Switzerland,J Innate Immun,Journal of innate immunity,101469471,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (TREM1 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism', 'Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC6741579,2013/11/28 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['000355892 [pii]', '10.1159/000355892 [doi]']",ppublish,J Innate Immun. 2014;6(3):339-52. doi: 10.1159/000355892.

Identification of mutations in genes encoding components of these NF-kappaB signaling pathways in lymphoid malignancies confirmed their key role in leukemogenesis. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of thymocytes that despite significant therapeutic advances can still be fatal. Although mutations in NF-kappaB genes have not been reported in T-ALL, NF-kappaB constitutive activation in human T-ALL and in acute T-cell leukemia mouse models has been observed. Although these studies revealed activation of members of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways in acute T-cell leukemia, only inhibition of canonical NF-kappaB signaling was shown to impair leukemic T cell growth. Besides playing an important pro-oncogenic role in leukemic T cells, NF-kappaB signaling also appears to modulate T-cell leukemogenesis through its action in microenvironmental stromal cells. This article reviews recent data on the role of these transcription factors in T-ALL and pinpoints further research crucial to determine the value of NF-kappaB inhibition as a means to treat T-ALL.","['Dos Santos, Nuno R', 'Ghezzo, Marinella N', 'da Silva, Ricardo C', 'Fernandes, Monica T']","['Dos Santos NR', 'Ghezzo MN', 'da Silva RC', 'Fernandes MT']","['IBB-Institute for Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Centre for Molecular and Structural Biomedicine (CBME), University of Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal. nrsantos@ualg.pt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101105,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC3840450,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['cancers2041838 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers2041838 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2010 Nov 5;2(4):1838-60. doi: 10.3390/cancers2041838.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For improved and reliable identification of KIT D816V, we have developed an allele-specific quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) with an enhanced sensitivity of 0.01-0.1 %, which was superior to denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (0.5-1 %) or conventional sequencing (10-20 %). Overall, KIT D816 mutations were identified in 146/147 (99 %) of patients (D816V, n = 142; D816H, n = 2; D816Y, n = 2) with SM, including indolent SM (ISM, n = 63, 43 %), smoldering SM (n = 8, 5 %), SM with associated hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD, n = 16, 11 %), and aggressive SM/mast cell leukemia +/- AHNMD (ASM/MCL, n = 60, 41 %). If positive in BM, the KIT D816V mutation was found in PB of all patients with advanced SM (SM-AHNMD, ASM, and MCL) and in 46 % (23/50) of patients with ISM. There was a strong correlation between the KIT D816V expressed allele burden (KIT D816V EAB) with results obtained from DNA by genomic allele-specific PCR and also with disease activity (e.g., serum tryptase level), disease subtype (e.g., indolent vs. advanced SM) and survival. In terms of monitoring of residual disease, qualitative and quantitative assessment of KIT D816V and KIT D816V EAB was successfully used for sequential analysis after chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We therefore conclude that RQ-PCR assays for KIT D816V are useful complimentary tools for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and evaluation of prognosis in patients with SM.","['Erben, Philipp', 'Schwaab, Juliana', 'Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Teichmann, Martina', 'Schneider, Sven', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Giehl, Michelle', 'Marx, Alexander', 'Hartmann, Karin', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Reiter, Andreas']","['Erben P', 'Schwaab J', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Horny HP', 'Jawhar M', 'Sotlar K', 'Fabarius A', 'Teichmann M', 'Schneider S', 'Ernst T', 'Muller MC', 'Giehl M', 'Marx A', 'Hartmann K', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hofmann WK', 'Cross NC', 'Reiter A']","['III.

Respiratory infection causes a globally significant disease burden and frequently progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome, a devastating inflammatory condition characterized by neutrophil recruitment and accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid causing impaired lung function. We hypothesized that targeting the intracellular protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) by a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (AT7519) or a flavone (wogonin) would accelerate neutrophil apoptosis and resolution of established inflammation, but without detriment to bacterial clearance. Mcl-1 loss induced human neutrophil apoptosis, but did not induce macrophage apoptosis nor impair phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. Neutrophil-dominant inflammation was modelled in mice by either endotoxin or bacteria (Escherichia coli). Downregulating inflammatory cell Mcl-1 had anti-inflammatory, pro-resolution effects, shortening the resolution interval (Ri) from 19 to 7 h and improved organ dysfunction with enhanced alveolar-capillary barrier integrity. Conversely, attenuating drug-induced Mcl-1 downregulation inhibited neutrophil apoptosis and delayed resolution of endotoxin-mediated lung inflammation. Importantly, manipulating lung inflammatory cell Mcl-1 also accelerated resolution of bacterial infection (Ri; 50 to 16 h) concurrent with enhanced bacterial clearance. Therefore, manipulating inflammatory cell Mcl-1 accelerates inflammation resolution without detriment to host defense against bacteria, and represents a target for treating infection-associated inflammation.","['Lucas, C D', 'Dorward, D A', 'Tait, M A', 'Fox, S', 'Marwick, J A', 'Allen, K C', 'Robb, C T', 'Hirani, N', 'Haslett, C', 'Duffin, R', 'Rossi, A G']","['Lucas CD', 'Dorward DA', 'Tait MA', 'Fox S', 'Marwick JA', 'Allen KC', 'Robb CT', 'Hirani N', 'Haslett C', 'Duffin R', 'Rossi AG']","[""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""1] MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK [2] Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, California, USA."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."", ""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,United States,Mucosal Immunol,Mucosal immunology,101299742,"['0 (4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid', 'piperidin-4-ylamide)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung/*immunology/*metabolism/microbiology/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutrophil Infiltration/immunology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Pneumonia/genetics/immunology/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology']",PMC3940382,2013/11/28 06:00,2015/01/31 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['mi2013102 [pii]', '10.1038/mi.2013.102 [doi]']",ppublish,Mucosal Immunol. 2014 Jul;7(4):857-68. doi: 10.1038/mi.2013.102.

They lead to dysfunction of DNMT3A protein and represent a marker for poor prognosis. Effects of genetic mutations can be mimicked by epigenetic modifications in the DNA methylation (DNAm) pattern. Using DNAm profiles of the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA), we identified aberrant hypermethylation at an internal promoter region of DNMT3A, which occurred in about 40% of AML patients. Bisulfite pyrosequencing assays designed for this genomic region validated hypermethylation specifically in a subset of our AML samples. High DNAm levels at this site are particularly observed in samples without genetic mutations in DNMT3A. Epimutations and mutations of DNMT3A were associated with related gene expression changes such as upregulation of the homeobox genes in HOXA and HOXB clusters. Furthermore, epimutations in DNMT3A were enriched in patients with poor or intermediate cytogenetic risk, and in patients with shorter event-free survival and overall survival (OS). Taken together, aberrant DNA hypermethylation within the DNMT3A gene, in analogy to DNMT3A mutations, is frequently observed in AML and both modifications seem to be useful for risk stratification or choice of therapeutic regimen.","['Jost, E', 'Lin, Q', 'Weidner, C I', 'Wilop, S', 'Hoffmann, M', 'Walenda, T', 'Schemionek, M', 'Herrmann, O', 'Zenke, M', 'Brummendorf, T H', 'Koschmieder, S', 'Wagner, W']","['Jost E', 'Lin Q', 'Weidner CI', 'Wilop S', 'Hoffmann M', 'Walenda T', 'Schemionek M', 'Herrmann O', 'Zenke M', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Koschmieder S', 'Wagner W']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering-Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering-Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",PMC4051212,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013362 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.362 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1227-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.362.

One of the major challenges in treatment of CLL is the achievement of a complete remission to prevent relapse of disease originating from cells within lymphoid tissues and subsequent chemoresistance. In search for novel drugs that target CLL cells in protective microenvironments, we performed a fungal extract screen using cocultures of primary CLL cells with bone marrow-derived stromal cells. A secondary metabolite produced by Penicillium aquamarinium was identified as Chaetoglobosin A (ChA), a member of the cytochalasan family that showed preferential induction of apoptosis in CLL cells, even under culture conditions that mimic lymphoid tissues. In vitro testing of 89 CLL cases revealed effective targeting of CLL cells by ChA, independent of bad prognosis characteristics, like 17p deletion or TP53 mutation. To provide insight into its mechanism of action, we showed that ChA targets filamentous actin in CLL cells and thereby induces cell-cycle arrest and inhibits membrane ruffling and cell migration. Our data further revealed that ChA prevents CLL cell activation and sensitizes them for treatment with PI3K and BTK inhibitors, suggesting this compound as a novel potential drug for CLL.","['Knudsen, P B', 'Hanna, B', 'Ohl, S', 'Sellner, L', 'Zenz, T', 'Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Larsen, T O', 'Lichter, P', 'Seiffert, M']","['Knudsen PB', 'Hanna B', 'Ohl S', 'Sellner L', 'Zenz T', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Larsen TO', 'Lichter P', 'Seiffert M']","['1] Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany [2] Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany [2] Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany [2] Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131127,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '50335-03-0 (chaetoglobosins)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokinesis/*drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fungi/chemistry', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mycotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013360 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.360 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1289-98. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.360.

As the known oncomir, miR-17~92, is regulated by BCR-ABL fusion in chronic myeloid leukaemia, we investigated its role in BCR-ABL translocated ALL. miR-17~92-encoded miRNAs were significantly less abundant in BCR-ABL-positive as compared to -negative ALL-cells and overexpression of miR-17~19b triggered apoptosis in a BCR-ABL-dependent manner. Stable isotope labelling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) followed by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) identified several apoptosis-related proteins including Bcl2 as potential targets of miR-17~19b. We validated Bcl2 as a direct target of this miRNA cluster in mice and humans, and, similar to miR-17~19b overexpression, Bcl2-specific RNAi strongly induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL-positive cells. Furthermore, BCR-ABL-positive human ALL cell lines were more sensitive to pharmacological BCL2 inhibition than negative ones. Finally, in a xenograft model using patient-derived leukaemic blasts, real-time, in vivo imaging confirmed pharmacological inhibition of BCL2 as a new therapeutic strategy in BCR-ABL-positive ALL. These data demonstrate the role of miR-17~92 in regulation of apoptosis, and identify BCL2 as a therapeutic target of particular relevance in BCR-ABL-positive ALL.","['Scherr, M', 'Elder, A', 'Battmer, K', 'Barzan, D', 'Bomken, S', 'Ricke-Hoch, M', 'Schroder, A', 'Venturini, L', 'Blair, H J', 'Vormoor, J', 'Ottmann, O', 'Ganser, A', 'Pich, A', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner, D', 'Heidenreich, O', 'Eder, M']","['Scherr M', 'Elder A', 'Battmer K', 'Barzan D', 'Bomken S', 'Ricke-Hoch M', 'Schroder A', 'Venturini L', 'Blair HJ', 'Vormoor J', 'Ottmann O', 'Ganser A', 'Pich A', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner D', 'Heidenreich O', 'Eder M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""1] Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK [2] Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology and Oncology, Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."", 'Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', ""1] Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK [2] Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology and Oncology, Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."", 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Infectious Diseases, J.W.

Most investigators currently classify 5-AZA-CdR and 5-AC as inhibitors of DNA methylation, which can reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by this epigenetic event. Examination of the pharmacology of these analogues reveals important differences with respect to their molecular mechanism of action. The action of 5-AZA-CdR is due to its incorporation into DNA. 5-AC is a riboside analogue that is incorporated primarily into RNA. A small fraction of 5-AC is converted to its deoxyribose form by ribonucleotide reductase and subsequently incorporated into DNA. The incorporation of 5-AC into RNA can interfere with the biological function of RNA and result in an inhibition protein synthesis. Microarray analysis revealed that both these analogues target the expression of different cohorts of genes. Preclinical studies show that 5-AZA-CdR is a more effective antileukemic agent than 5-AC. One explanation for this observation is that 5-AC blocks the progression of some leukemic cells from G1 into S phase, and this protects these cells from the chemotherapeutic action of this riboside analogue related to its incorporation into DNA. However, differences in chemotherapeutic efficacy of these related analogues have not been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials in patients with hematological malignancies. These observations should be taken into consideration in the design of new clinical trials using 5-AZA-CdR or 5-AC in patients with MDS and AML.","['Momparler, Richard L']",['Momparler RL'],"[""Departement de Pharmacologie, Service d' Hematologie et Oncologie, Centre de Recherche, CHU-Saint-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1C5, Canada. richard.l.momparler@umontreal.ca.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120821,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,PMC3763670,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['ph5080875 [pii]', '10.3390/ph5080875 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2012 Aug 21;5(8):875-81. doi: 10.3390/ph5080875.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The roles of these inhibitors in cancer treatment have been studied in laboratories and clinical trials, and some encouraging results have been obtained. Interestingly, targeting of Hsp90 has been shown to be effective in inhibition of cancer stem cells responsible for leukemia initiation and progression, providing a strategy for finding a cure.

Although its mechanism of action remains unclear, this drug appears to potentiate the innate response. Acute phase proteins are one of the key components of innate immunity and studies describing their use as a monitoring tool for the immune system in animals undergoing interferon-omega therapy are lacking. This study aimed to determine whether interferon-omega therapy influences acute phase protein concentrations namely serum amyloid-A, alpha-1-glycoprotein and C-reactive protein. METHODS: A single-arm study was performed using 16 cats, living in an animal shelter, naturally infected with retroviruses and subjected to the interferon-omega therapy licensed protocol. Samples were collected before (D0), during (D10 and D30) and after therapy (D65).

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to explore the association between dietary factors that have previously been associated with leukemia risk, including red and processed meat, poultry, offal, fish, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and seeds/nuts, and risk of both lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. No significant associations were observed between dietary measures and total, lymphoid, and myeloid leukemias. Additional subtype analyses showed no dietary association with risk of major subtypes of leukemias.

However, the intrinsic fidelity of DNA synthesis catalyzed by retroviral RTs is low. Reported error rates are in the range 1.2 x 10(-5)-6.7 x 10(-4), with oncoretroviral RTs being the most faithful enzymes. Wild-type HIV-1 group O (HIV-1O) RT is a thermostable polymerase that is able to synthesize cDNA at temperatures as high as 70 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, its error rate has been estimated at 5.8 x 10(-5) in M13mp2 lacZ-based forward mutation assays. However, at higher temperatures (e.g. 50 and 55 degrees C), the accuracy of HIV-1O RT is increased by approximately two- to five-fold. At 55 degrees C, the HIV-1O RT error rate (1.3 x 10(-5)) was similar to that shown by the AffinityScript (Agilent Technologies Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) RT, a commercially available thermostable murine leukaemia virus RT. At higher temperatures, the increased accuracy of the HIV-1 enzyme results from a lower base substitution error rate, although it shows a higher tendency to introduce frameshifts. Kinetic studies carried out with model template-primers suggest minor differences in nucleotide discrimination, although, at higher temperatures, HIV-1O RT showed a reduced ability to extend mispaired template-primers.","['Alvarez, Mar', 'Menendez-Arias, Luis']","['Alvarez M', 'Menendez-Arias L']","[""Centro de Biologia Molecular 'Severo Ochoa', Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131126,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Replication', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Temperature']",,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/03/05 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/febs.12605 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2014 Jan;281(1):342-51. doi: 10.1111/febs.12605.

It is a high malignant leukemia with bad prognosis and a short survival. A 72-year old female was admitted to hospital with clinically suspected plasmocytoma. She had eccematoid changes on her trunk and underarms. Radiogramm showed osteolytic lesions of the right thigh and pelvis. FNA of the bone marrow revealed hypercellular smear with 80% of mast cells and immature mast cells which were cytochemically positive to toluidin (Figure 1. and 2.), chloracetate, alcian blue, acid fosphatase and Sudan black and negative to periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and peroxidase (POX). The peripheral blood smear showed single mast cells which were positive to toluidin. The bone marrow biopsy confirmed mast cell leukemia. The chariogramm of the bone marrow showed numerical and structural chromosomal changes. Two month after the diagnosis the patient suffered from right thigh fracture and was treated with local radiotherapy, antihistaminic and analgetic therapy. The patient died within 6 month after the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Mast cell leukemia is very rare and high grade leukemia with short survival time. Cytological diagnosis is possible, when there is more then 20% of atypical mast cells in the bone marrow aspirate. The diagnosis of aleukemic variant of mast cell leukemia could be stated if there is less then 10% of mast cells in the peripheral blood.","['Vasilj, Ankica', 'Katovic, Sandra Kojic', 'Maricevic, Ivana', 'Zokvic, Edita', 'Gacina, Petar']","['Vasilj A', 'Katovic SK', 'Maricevic I', 'Zokvic E', 'Gacina P']","['Centar za citologiju i Zavod za hematologiju, Klinicki bolnicki centar ""Sestre milosrdnice"", Zagreb, Hrvatska. ankica.vasilj@kbcsm.hr']",['hrv'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis/*complications']",,2013/11/28 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2013/11/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2013 Mar;67(1):61-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mastocitna leukemija--prikaz bolesnice.,,,,,

Diagnosing IA has long been problematic owing to the inability to culture the main causal agent A. fumigatus from blood. Microscopic examination and culture of respiratory tract specimens have lacked sensitivity, and biopsy tissue for histopathological examination is rarely obtainable. Thus, for many years there has been a great interest in nonculture-based techniques such as the detection of galactomannan, beta -D-glucan, and DNA by PCR-based methods. Recent meta-analyses suggest that these approaches have broadly similar performance parameters in terms of sensitivity and specificity to diagnose IA. Improvements have been made in our understanding of the limitations of antigen assays and the standardisation of PCR-based DNA detection. Thus, in more recent years, the debate has focussed on how these assays can be incorporated into diagnostic strategies to maximise improvements in outcome whilst limiting unnecessary use of antifungal therapy. Furthermore, there is a current interest in applying these tests to monitor the effectiveness of therapy after diagnosis and predict clinical outcomes. The search for improved markers for the early and sensitive diagnosis of IA continues to be a challenge.","['Barton, Richard C']",['Barton RC'],"['Mycology Reference Centre, Department of Microbiology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds LS1 3EX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130114,Egypt,Scientifica (Cairo),Scientifica,101589932,,,,PMC3820361,2013/11/28 06:00,2013/11/28 06:01,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/459405 [doi]'],ppublish,Scientifica (Cairo). 2013;2013:459405. doi: 10.1155/2013/459405.

Several studies have demonstrated that microRNAs play a crucial role in hematopoietic differentiation and hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant expression of microRNAs has been associated with specific genetic abnormalities and clinical outcome of patients with AML. In addition, since microRNAs can function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the potential of using these molecules as therapeutic targets opens up new opportunities in the future of AML therapy. The recent demonstration that other regulatory ncRNAs, in addition to microRNAs, are involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation and diseases, suggests that they may also have a biological relevance in AML.

Although QDS are attractive nanomaterials due to their novel and unique physicochemical properties, concerns about their toxicity remain. We suggest a combination strategy, CdSe/ZnS QDs together with curcumin, a natural yellow pigment from turmeric, to reduce QD-induced cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was to explore a potentially effective cancer treatment: co-exposure of HL-60 cells and human normal lymphocytes to CdSe/ZnS QDs and curcumin. Cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and DNA damage induced by QDs and/or curcumin with or without ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation were evaluated in both HL-60 cells and normal lymphocytes. In HL-60 cells, cell death, apoptosis, ROS generation, and single/double DNA strand breaks induced by QDs were enhanced by treatment with curcumin and UVA irradiation. The protective effects of curcumin on cell viability, apoptosis, and ROS generation were observed in normal lymphocytes, but not leukemia cells. These results demonstrated that treatment with QD combined with curcumin increased cell death in HL-60 cells, which was mediated by ROS generation.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the dichloromethane extract of AD (AD-X) and that of urban dust (NAD-X) collected during a non-AD period on gene expression in HL-60 cells using Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChips. Global changes in gene expression were analyzed after 24 h of incubation with 50 or 100 mug/ml AD-X and NAD-X. By one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05) and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction for false discovery rate of the results, 573 and 297 genes were identified as AD-X- and NAD-X-responsive, respectively. The genes were classified into three groups by Venn diagram analysis of their expression profile, i.e., 290 AD-X-specific, 14 NAD-X-specific, and 283 overlapping genes. Quantitative realtime PCR confirmed the changes in the expression levels of the selected genes. The expression patterns of five genes, namely SORL1, RABEPK, DDIT4, AZU1, and NUDT1 differed significantly between the two groups.

It has also been shown to exhibit significant anti-tumor activity against human leukemia (HL-60 cells) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep-G2 cells). Herein we investigated the effect of saponin 1 in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) U251MG and U87MG cells. Saponin 1 induced significant growth inhibition in both glioblastoma cell lines, with a 50% inhibitory concentration at 24 h of 7.4 microg/ml in U251MG cells and 8.6 microg/ml in U87MG cells, respectively. Nuclear fluorescent staining and electron microscopy showed that saponin 1 caused characteristic apoptotic morphological changes in the GBM cell lines. Saponin 1-induced apoptosis was also verified by DNA ladder electrophoresis and flow cytometry. Additionally, immunocytochemistry and western blotting analyses revealed a time-dependent decrease in the expression and nuclear location of NF-kappaB following saponin 1 treatment. Western blotting data indicated a significant decreased expression of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family members,(e.g., survivin and XIAP) by saponin 1. Moreover, saponin 1 caused a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and initiated apoptosis by activating caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the GBM cell lines. These findings indicate that saponin 1 inhibits cell growth of GBM cells at least partially by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting survival signaling mediated by NF-kappaB. In addition, in vivo study also demonstrated an obvious inhibition of saponin 1 treatment on the tumor growth of U251MG and U87MG cells-produced xenograft tumors in nude mice. Given the minimal toxicities of saponin 1 in non-neoplastic astrocytes, our results suggest that saponin 1 exhibits significant in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy and merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for GBM.","['Li, Juan', 'Tang, Haifeng', 'Zhang, Yun', 'Tang, Chi', 'Li, Bo', 'Wang, Yuangang', 'Gao, Zhenhui', 'Luo, Peng', 'Yin, Anan', 'Wang, Xiaoyang', 'Cheng, Guang', 'Fei, Zhou']","['Li J', 'Tang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Tang C', 'Li B', 'Wang Y', 'Gao Z', 'Luo P', 'Yin A', 'Wang X', 'Cheng G', 'Fei Z']","[""Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China ; Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131121,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Saponins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3836797,2013/11/28 06:00,2015/01/03 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0081258 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-21772 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 21;8(11):e81258. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081258. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(1). doi:10.1371/annotation/0c3019ff-6d7b-444b-8eb5-9461f3dcd029'],,,,,,

With this consideration, we have designed and characterized a microfluidic device that is easy to fabricate and operate, yet contains several functional elements. Our device is a simple polyester-based microfluidic chip capable of simultaneously screening multiple independent stem cell culture conditions. Generated by laser ablation and stacking of multiple layers of polyester film, this device integrates a 10 x 10 microwell array for cell culture with a continuous perfusion system and a non-linear concentration gradient generator. We performed numerical calculations to predict the gradient formation and calculate the shear stress acting on the cells inside the device. The device operation was validated by culturing murine embryonic stem cells inside the microwells for 5 days. Furthermore, we showed the ability to maintain the pluripotency of stem cell aggregates in response to concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor ranging from 0 to approximately 1000 U/ml.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Surgically resected OSCC tissues from 51 Chinese patients and 13 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines were sequenced for mutations in the entire coding regions of Notch1 and TP53 using a next-generation sequencing platform. Sequences of the genes were also determined in corresponding normal tissues from 46 of the 51 patients. Mutations and their association with clinical parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Six mutations in Notch1 and 11 mutations in TP53 coding regions were detected in 4 (31%) and 10 (77%) of the 13 HNSCC cell lines, respectively. Forty-two somatic Notch1 mutations, including 7 nonsense mutations and 11 mutations within the domain commonly harboring potential activating mutations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, were detected in 22 (43%) of the 51 Chinese OSCC tumors. In comparison, 25 somatic TP53 mutations were observed in 21 (41%) of the 51 tumors. Patients whose tumors carried Notch1 mutation had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survivals (P = 0.004 and P = 0.001, respectively, by log-rank test) compared with those whose tumors carried no Notch1 mutation. Multivariate analysis showed that both Notch1 mutation and lymph node metastasis are independent prognostic factors in the patient population (P = 0.001). All 15 patients with both Notch1 mutation and nodal metastasis recurred or metastasized within 2 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Notch1 mutation is common in Chinese OSCC and associates with clinical outcomes. The complexity of the mutation spectrum warrants further investigation of Notch1 in Chinese patients with OSCC.","['Song, Xiaomeng', 'Xia, Ronghui', 'Li, Jiang', 'Long, Zhifeng', 'Ren, Hening', 'Chen, Wantao', 'Mao, Li']","['Song X', 'Xia R', 'Li J', 'Long Z', 'Ren H', 'Chen W', 'Mao L']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology and Diagnostic Sciences, University of Maryland School of Dentistry; Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore; and Personal Diagnostix Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asians', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC3946562,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1050 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1050 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Feb 1;20(3):701-10. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1050.

No treatment has achieved a high complete remission (CR) rate even in small series, and of 39 reported cases from six studies, overall response rate after cladribine was 44% with 8% CRs. Rituximab has been found to increase the sensitivity of malignant cells to cladribine, suggesting that combination with cladribine might improve response in HCLv. To test this hypothesis, patients with HCLv were treated with simultaneous cladribine and rituximab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with HCLv with 0 to 1 prior courses of cladribine received cladribine 0.15 mg/kg for days 1 to 5, with eight weekly doses of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) beginning day 1. Restaging was performed, and minimal residual disease (MRD) in blood and marrow was quantified using PCR, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: By 6 months, 9 (90%) of 10 patients achieved CR, compared with 3 (8%) of 39 reported cases treated with cladribine alone (P < 0.0001). Of the 9 CRs, 8 remain free of MRD at 12 to 48 (median 27) months of follow-up. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed when beginning cladribine and rituximab on the same day, although most patients required short-term steroids to prevent and treat rituximab infusion reactions. Cytopenias in CRs resolved in 7 to 211 (median 34) days without major infections. CONCLUSION: Although cladribine alone lacks effectiveness for early or relapsed HCLv, cladribine with immediate rituximab achieves CRs without MRD and is feasible to administer.","['Kreitman, Robert J', 'Wilson, Wyndham', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Arons, Evgeny', 'Roth, Laura', 'Sapolsky, Jeffrey', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Wilson W', 'Calvo KR', 'Arons E', 'Roth L', 'Sapolsky J', 'Zhou H', 'Raffeld M', 'Stetler-Stevenson M']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Laboratories of Molecular Biology, Pathology, and Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute; and Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3867590,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1752 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1752 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Dec 15;19(24):6873-81. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1752.

In tissues, stromal cells constitutively secrete and present CXCL12 via cell-surface-bound glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), thereby attracting CLL cells and protecting them from cytotoxic drugs, a mechanism that may account for residual disease after conventional CLL therapy. NOX-A12, an RNA oligonucleotide in L-configuration (Spiegelmer) that binds and neutralizes CXCL12, was developed for interference with CXCL12 in the tumor microenvironment and for cell mobilization. Here, we examined effects of NOX-A12 on CLL cell migration and drug sensitivity. We found that NOX-A12 effectively inhibited CXCL12-induced chemotaxis of CLL cells. In contrast, NOX-A12 increased CLL migration underneath a confluent layer of BM stromal cells (BMSCs) due to interference with the CXCL12 gradient established by BMSCs. In particular, NOX-A12 competes with GAGs such as heparin for CXCL12 binding, leading to the release of CXCL12 from stromal cell-surface-bound GAGs, and thereby to neutralization of the chemokine. Furthermore, NOX-A12 sensitizes CLL cells toward bendamustine and fludarabine in BMSC cocultures. These data demonstrate that NOX-A12 effectively interferes with CLL cell migration and BMSC-mediated drug resistance, and establishes a rationale for clinical development of NOX-A12 in combination with conventional agents in CLL.","['Hoellenriegel, Julia', 'Zboralski, Dirk', 'Maasch, Christian', 'Rosin, Nathalie Y', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Kruschinski, Anna', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Hoellenriegel J', 'Zboralski D', 'Maasch C', 'Rosin NY', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Kruschinski A', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (NOX-A12)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcellular Cell Migration/drug effects']",PMC4123413,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/04/22 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36020-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-493924 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Feb 13;123(7):1032-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-493924.

In 2003 imatinib was introduced as a single-agent course following induction (N = 86, late imatinib). In 2005 imatinib was added to the second phase of induction (N = 89, early imatinib). The complete remission (CR) rate was 92% in the imatinib cohort vs 82% in the preimatinib cohort (P = .004). At 4 years, the overall survival (OS) of all patients in the imatinib cohort was 38% vs 22% in the preimatinib cohort (P = .003). The magnitude of the difference between the preimatinib and imatinib cohorts in event-free survival (EFS), OS, and relapse-free survival (RFS) seen in univariate analysis was even greater in the multivariate analysis. In the preimatinib cohort, 31% of those starting treatment achieved hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) compared with 46% in the imatinib cohort. A Cox multivariate analysis taking alloHSCT into account showed a modest additional benefit to imatinib (hazard ratio for EFS = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.93, P = .02), but no significant benefit for OS and RFS. Adding imatinib to standard therapy improves CR rate and long-term OS for adults with ALL. A proportion of the OS benefit derives from the fact that imatinib facilitates alloHSCT.

We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of IFIs in 152 patients with AML who had been admitted to a tertiary cancer center between August 2009 and March 2011 and received PAP within 120 days after first remission-induction chemotherapy. We excluded patients who had undergone stem cell transplantation. Patients received a PAP drug with anti-Aspergillus activity during 72% (7,660/10,572) of prophylaxis-days. The incidence of documented IFIs (definite or probable according to revised European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] criteria) was 2.0/1,000 prophylaxis-days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 3.04). IFIs due to molds were more common than IFIs due to yeasts (1.5/1,000 prophylaxis-days versus 0.4/1,000 prophylaxis-days; P = 0.01). Echinocandin-based PAP (8.6 and 7.1/1,000 prophylaxis-days, respectively) was associated with higher rates of documented IFIs than anti-Aspergillus azoles (voriconazole or posaconazole) (2.4 and 1.1/1,000 prophylaxis-days, respectively) at both 42 days (P = 0.03) and 120 days (P < 0.0001) after first remission-induction chemotherapy. The incidence of overall (documented and presumed) IFIs (P < 0.001), documented IFIs (P < 0.01), and empirical antifungal therapies (P < 0.0001) was higher during the first 42 days than after day 42. Despite the broad use of PAP with anti-Aspergillus activity, IFIs, especially molds, remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in AML patients, predominantly during the remission-induction phase. Patients receiving echinocandin-based PAP experienced higher rates of IFIs than did those receiving anti-Aspergillus azoles.","['Gomes, Marisa Z R', 'Mulanovich, Victor E', 'Jiang, Y', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Gomes MZ', 'Mulanovich VE', 'Jiang Y', 'Lewis RE', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Echinocandins/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/diagnosis/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",PMC3910838,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.01525-13 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01525-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014;58(2):865-73. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01525-13.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which VB1 induces apoptosis in MDA-MB231 cells have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, to our knowledge, we provide for the first time mechanistic evidence that VB1-induced apoptosis in the human breast cancer line, MDA-MB-231, is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of caspases and the modulation of the expression of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 (Mcl1), B cell lymphoma2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) proteins. The silencing of Mcl-1 by RNA interference enhanced VB1-induced apoptosis. In addition, VB1 did not induce ROS generation or apoptosis in the immortalized noncancerous breast cell line, MCF-10A. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying VB1-induced apoptosis, and highlight VB1 as a promising candidate for the therapy of human breast cancer.","['Liu, Li-Hua', 'Zhou, Ying-Jun', 'Ding, Lan', 'Zhang, Shun-Zhi', 'Sun, Ji', 'Cao, Jian-Guo']","['Liu LH', 'Zhou YJ', 'Ding L', 'Zhang SZ', 'Sun J', 'Cao JG']","['The First Hospital of Changsha, Changsha, Hunan 410005, P.R.

Additionally, the role of surgical intervention is not well established. In this review, we discuss the challenges and controversy regarding diagnosis and optimal management when clear surgical guidelines are absent. In the literature, there is great diversity in the surgical approach to these patients, which leads to a high percentage of diagnostic errors, risks of complications, and unnecessary interventions. We review the literature and assess whether surgical intervention produces better outcomes than a non-surgical approach. Studies published on perianal sepsis in neutropenic cancer patients were identified by searching PubMed using the following key words: ""perianal sepsis/abscesses, anorectal sepsis/abscess, neutropenia, hematological malignancy, cancer"". No randomized or prospective studies on the management of acute perianal sepsis in hematological malignancies were found. The largest retrospective study and most comprehensive clinical data demonstrated that 42% of patients were treated successfully without surgical intervention and without morbidity or mortality related to treatment chosen. Small retrospective studies advocated surgical intervention, while the majority of successes were in a non-operative treatment. It is difficult to formulate a conclusion given the small retrospective series on management of neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. While there is no evidence mandating a routine surgical approach in this category of patients, non-surgical management including careful follow-up to determine whether the patient's condition is deteriorating or treatment has failed is an acceptable approach in selected patients without pathognomonic features of abscess. Comprehensive and well-designed prospective studies are needed to firmly establish the guidelines of treatment protocols.","['Baker, B', 'Al-Salman, M', 'Daoud, F']","['Baker B', 'Al-Salman M', 'Daoud F']","['Surgical Oncology Department, King Hussein Cancer Center, Queen Rania Al Abdullah Street, Amman, 11941, Jordan, bilalbaker99@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20131126,Italy,Tech Coloproctol,Techniques in coloproctology,9613614,,IM,"['Abscess/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery', 'Acute Disease', 'Anus Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Sepsis/diagnosis/etiology/*surgery']",,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10151-013-1082-z [doi]'],ppublish,Tech Coloproctol. 2014 Apr;18(4):327-33. doi: 10.1007/s10151-013-1082-z.

Therefore, there is a need to explore health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in depth, specifically in maintenance therapy, where the available data are minimal. This study was conducted to assess the varied items listed in the domains of HRQOL of Children with ALL during maintenance therapy from a parent's perspective. METHODS: Forty children on the maintenance therapy of ALL, 40 siblings, and 40 healthy children were enrolled, and the HRQOL was assessed by parent proxy reports and child self-reports using PedsQL generic core 4.0 in local language. RESULTS: Parents significantly overrated the HRQOL of ALL patients, their siblings, and healthy children in comparison with child self-report in all domains of health. The HRQOL of children with ALL on maintenance therapy was significantly poorer than siblings and healthy children, but their ability to self-care, household work, attentiveness, and ability to do homework were not affected as per parents' reports. Parents reported that absenteeism because of sickness and hospital visits was more among children with ALL than siblings and healthy children. Children with ALL had emotional problems such as fear, anger, sleeping problems, and worries. In a social health domain, parents reported difficulty in competing among children with ALL. The HRQOL of siblings was as good as healthy children in physical, social, and school health domains as per parents' reports. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, parents overrated HRQOL in all groups of children. The study identified the various items in each domain of HRQOL that were affected in children with ALL from parents' perspective; this would guide health care professionals to focus on these specific items so as to improve the overall HRQOL of children with ALL.","['Bansal, Minakshi', 'Sharma, Kamlesh K', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Vatsa, Manju']","['Bansal M', 'Sharma KK', 'Bakhshi S', 'Vatsa M']","['*College of Nursing daggerDr B.R.A.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2010, of the 1278 eligible pediatric patients treated for a malignant or nonmalignant disease, 54 were admitted to the PICU for respiratory distress (40.7%), neurological events (33.3%), severe sepsis (14.8%), and organ failure (11.2%). RESULTS: Rate of PICU admission was 4.2%, with a 2-year cumulative incidence of 4.5%. Risk factors associated with higher cumulative incidence of PICU admission were older age at study entry (P=0.003), nonmalignant underlying disease (P=0.015), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (P<0.001). Patients with leukemia/lymphoma were more likely to be admitted to the PICU compared with patients with solid tumors (P<0.001). Patients admitted because of organ failure had the highest frequency of death within 90 days. Factors significantly associated with survival at 90 days from PICU admission included: no mechanical ventilation (P<0.001), nonmalignant underlying disease (P=0.030), and year of PICU admission after 2005 (P=0.038).

We aimed at elaborating longer-term health outcomes of fetal overnutrition during the earliest stages of development. We utilized Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice to induce pre-conceptional and gestational obesity and followed offspring outcomes in the absence of any postnatal obesogenic influences. Male adult offspring developed overweight, insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hyperuricemia and hepatic steatosis; all these features were not observed in females. Instead, they showed impaired fasting glucose and a reduced fat mass and adipocyte size. Influences of the interaction of maternal diet *sex concerned offspring genes involved in fatty liver disease, lipid droplet size regulation and fat mass expansion.

The apoptosis of the elements bearing T-cell receptors with critical affinity for the exhibited self-antigens prevents the escape of autoreactive clones and represents a simple and efficient mechanism of deletional self-tolerance. However, AIRE action relies on an articulated complex of biophysical and biochemical properties, in most cases attributable to single subspecialized domains.

Limited evidence suggests that community-acquired infections may increase the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, associations with other myeloid malignancies including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER)-Medicare database, fourteen community-acquired infections were compared between myeloid malignancy patients [AML (n=8489), CML (n=3626) diagnosed 1992-2005; MDS (n=3072) and MPNs (n=2001) diagnosed 2001-2005; and controls (200,000 for AML/CML and 97,681 for MDS/MPN]. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for gender, age and year of selection excluding infections diagnosed in the 13-month period prior to selection to reduce reverse causality. RESULTS: Risk of AML and MDS respectively, were significantly associated with respiratory tract infections, bronchitis (ORs 1.20 [95% CI: 1.14-1.26], 1.25 [95% CI: 1.16-1.36]), influenza (ORs 1.16 [95% CI: 1.07-1.25], 1.29 [95% CI: 1.16-1.44]), pharyngitis (ORs 1.13 [95% CI: 1.06-1.21], 1.22 [95% CI: 1.11-1.35]), pneumonia (ORs 1.28 [95% CI: 1.21-1.36], 1.52 [95% CI: 1.40-1.66]), sinusitis (ORs 1.23 [95% CI: 1.16-1.30], 1.25 [95% CI: 1.15-1.36]) as was cystitis (ORs 1.13 [95% CI: 1.07-1.18], 1.26 [95% CI: 1.17-1.36]). Cellulitis (OR 1.51 [95% CI: 1.39-1.64]), herpes zoster (OR 1.31 [95% CI: 1.14-1.50]) and gastroenteritis (OR 1.38 [95% CI: 1.17-1.64]) were more common in MDS patients than controls. For CML, associations were limited to bronchitis (OR 1.21 [95% CI: 1.12-1.31]), pneumonia (OR 1.49 [95% CI: 1.37-1.62]), sinusitis (OR 1.19 [95% CI: 1.09-1.29]) and cellulitis (OR 1.43 [95% CI: 1.32-1.55]) following Bonferroni correction. Only cellulitis (OR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.21-1.49]) remained significant in MPN patients. Many infections remained elevated when more than 6 years of preceding claims data were excluded. DISCUSSION: Common community-acquired infections may be important in the malignant transformation of the myeloid lineage. Differences in the aetiology of classic MPNs and other myeloid malignancies require further exploration.","['Titmarsh, Glen J', 'McMullin, Mary Frances', 'McShane, Charlene M', 'Clarke, Mike', 'Engels, Eric A', 'Anderson, Lesley A']","['Titmarsh GJ', 'McMullin MF', 'McShane CM', 'Clarke M', 'Engels EA', 'Anderson LA']","['Centre for Public Health, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Block B, Queens University Belfast, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast BT12 6BA, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.', ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast BT9 7BL, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom."", 'Centre for Public Health, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Block B, Queens University Belfast, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast BT12 6BA, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Public Health, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Block B, Queens University Belfast, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast BT12 6BA, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Shady Grove, Room 6E226, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Centre for Public Health, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Block B, Queens University Belfast, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast BT12 6BA, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.

Almost all types of paediatric cancer can occur in fetuses and neonates; however, the presentation and behaviour of neonatal tumours often differs from that in older children, leading to differences in diagnosis and management. The causes of neonatal cancer are unclear, but genetic factors probably have a key role. Other congenital abnormalities are frequently present. Teratoma and neuroblastoma are the most common histological types of neonatal cancer, with soft-tissue sarcoma, leukaemia, renal tumours, and brain tumours also among the more frequent types.

Vertebrates possess two classes of WNT signaling pathways: the ""canonical"" WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and the ""non-canonical"" pathways including WNT/Ca(2)(+) and WNT/Planar cell polarity [PCP] signaling. WNT4 influences hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion and survival; however, WNT4 function in cancer development and the resulting implications for oncogenesis are poorly understood.The aim of this study was twofold: first, to determine the expression of WNT4 in mature peripheral blood cells and diverse leukemia-derived cells including cell lines from hematopoietic neoplasms and cells from patients with leukemia; second, to identify the effect of this ligand on the proliferation and apoptosis of the blast-derived cell lines BJAB, Jurkat, CEM, K562, and HL60. METHODS: We determined WNT4 expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T- and B-lymphocytes from healthy individuals, as well as from five leukemia-derived cell lines and blasts derived from patients with leukemia. To analyze the effect of WNT4 on cell proliferation, PBMCs and cell lines were exposed to a commercially available WNT4 recombinant human protein. Furthermore, WNT4 expression was restored in BJAB cells using an inducible lentiviral expression system. Cell viability and proliferation were measured by the addition of WST-1 to cell cultures and counting cells; in addition, the progression of the cell cycle and the amount of apoptosis were analyzed in the absence or presence of WNT4. Finally, the expression of WNT-pathway target genes was measured by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: WNT4 expression was severely reduced in leukemia-derived cell lines and blasts derived from patients with leukemia. The exposure of cell lines to WNT4 recombinant protein significantly inhibited cell proliferation; inducing WNT4 expression in BJAB cells corroborated this observation. Interestingly, restoration of WNT4 expression in BJAB cells increased the accumulation of cells in G1 phase, and did not induce activation of canonical WNT/beta-catenin target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the WNT4 ligand plays a role in regulating the cell growth of leukemia-derived cells by arresting cells in the G1 cell cycle phase in an FZD6-independent manner, possibly through antagonizing the canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway.","['Garcia-Castro, Beatriz', 'Alvarez-Zavala, Monserrat', 'Riveros-Magana, Alma R', 'Ortiz-Lazareno, Pablo C', 'Ratkovich-Gonzalez, Sarah', 'Hernandez-Flores, Georgina', 'Bravo-Cuellar, Alejandro', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana']","['Garcia-Castro B', 'Alvarez-Zavala M', 'Riveros-Magana AR', 'Ortiz-Lazareno PC', 'Ratkovich-Gonzalez S', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Bravo-Cuellar A', 'Jave-Suarez LF', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A']","['Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Sierra Mojada No, 800, Col, Independencia, 44340 Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. adry.aguilar.lemarroy@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (FZD6 protein, human)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (WNT4 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt4 Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Frizzled Receptors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Wnt4 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4222640,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/03/22 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-557 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-557 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Nov 25;13:557. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-557.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about their cytotoxicity when they come into contact with biological systems. The aim of this work was to compare the effects of three commercially available AuNPs of different sizes (30, 50 and 90 nm) on human leukemia (HL-60) and hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines. AuNP-induced cytotoxicity was dose and time-dependent, with IC50 values higher than 15 mug/mL. Nanoparticle (NP) size and cell line slightly influenced on the cytotoxicity of AuNPs, although HL-60 cells proved to be more sensitive to the cytotoxic response than HepG2. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) protected HL-60 and HepG2 cells only against treatment with 30 nm AuNPs. In both cell types, glutathione (GSH) content was drastically depleted after 72 h of incubation with the three AuNPs (less than 30% in all cases), while the reduction of superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) activity depended on cell line. HepG2, but not HL-60 cells, exhibited a decrease of SOD activity ( approximately 45% of activity). The three AuNPs also caused a two-fold elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both cell lines. Thus, protective effect of NAC, depletion of GSH and increase of ROS appear to be determined by NP size and indicate that oxidative stress contributes to cytotoxicity of AuNPs.","['Mateo, Diego', 'Morales, Paloma', 'Avalos, Alicia', 'Haza, Ana I']","['Mateo D', 'Morales P', 'Avalos A', 'Haza AI']","['Departamento de Nutricion, Bromatologia y Tecnologia de los Alimentos, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid , Madrid , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131216,England,Toxicol Mech Methods,Toxicology mechanisms and methods,101134521,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Glutathione/analysis', 'Gold/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Particle Size', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/15376516.2013.869783 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Mech Methods. 2014 Mar;24(3):161-72. doi: 10.3109/15376516.2013.869783.

The clinicopathologic diagnosis remains elusive due to isolated skin findings and variable immunostaining. Cytogenetic and molecular findings have infrequently been reported. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with CMS were identified in the Massachusetts General Hospital pathology database between 2004 and 2012. Patients were excluded if concurrent blood or marrow acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome or lymphoproliferative disorder were diagnosed. RESULTS: Three patients were identified: a neonate with recurrent CMS and marrow disease that never met diagnostic criteria for AML and two patients relapsing as CMS without concurrent blood or marrow disease following chemotherapy-induced complete remission. Histology showed atypical mononuclear cell interstitial dermal infiltrates. All cases were CD68+, lysozyme+ and CD117-; one of two were CD34+; two of three were myeloperoxidase negative. 11q23 rearrangement, t(1;14), NPM1 (nucleophosmin I), FLT3-ITD (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication), and novel FLT3-D835 mutations were identified. CONCLUSION: An isolated atypical cutaneous infiltrate may represent aleukemic CMS and should prompt a search for other extramedullary sites of involvement. Immunohistochemistry, molecular and cytogenetic studies can help differentiate aleukemic CMS from benign and malignant, monocytic and histiocytic mimickers, and may potentially indicate therapy and prognosis.","['Aboutalebi, Amir', 'Korman, John B', 'Sohani, Aliyah R', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Louissaint, Abner Jr', 'Le, Long', 'Kraft, Stefan', 'Duncan, Lyn M', 'Nazarian, Rosalynn M']","['Aboutalebi A', 'Korman JB', 'Sohani AR', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Louissaint A Jr', 'Le L', 'Kraft S', 'Duncan LM', 'Nazarian RM']","['Department of Dermatology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20131008,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Databases, Factual', 'Dermis/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cup.12231 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2013 Dec;40(12):996-1005. doi: 10.1111/cup.12231.

Translocations of 9p24 involving JAK2 (9p24) and gain-of-function mutations of JAK2 with subsequent activation of the JAK2 kinase have been described in several hematological malignancies including B-ALL. However, rearrangements involving JAK2 are rare in B-ALL as only few cases have been described in the literature. FINDINGS: Herein, we present a case of pediatric B-ALL whose conventional cytogenetics revealed an abnormal karyotype with a reciprocal translocation involving 9p24 (JAK2) and 12p11.2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using the RP11-927H16 Spectrum Green JAK2 probe on previously G-banded metaphases confirmed the involvement of JAK2 in this rearrangement. Further FISH studies on the same previously G-banded metaphases using the LSI MLL probe helped to characterize an insertion of MLL into 6q27 as an additional abnormality in this karyotype. FISH studies performed on interphase nuclei also revealed an abnormal clone with MLL rearrangements in 23.6% of the nuclei examined as well as an abnormal clonal population with a deletion of the 5'IGH@ region in 88.3% of the nuclei examined. CONCLUSIONS: Rearrangements of 9p24 can result in constitutive activation of JAK2, and have been observed in B-ALL. Rearrangements of the MLL gene have also been described extensively in B-ALL. However, rearrangements of MLL with a partner at 6q27 and in conjunction with a translocation involving JAK2 have not been previously described. This case pinpoints the importance of FISH and conventional cytogenetics to characterize complex rearrangements in which JAK2 and MLL are involved. The therapeutic targeting of JAK2 and MLL in cases like this may be prognostically beneficial.","['Tirado, Carlos A', 'Shabsovich, David', 'DeNicola, Matthew', 'Rao, Dinesh', 'Yang, Lynn', 'Garcia, Rolando', 'Rao, Nagesh']","['Tirado CA', 'Shabsovich D', 'DeNicola M', 'Rao D', 'Yang L', 'Garcia R', 'Rao N']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'UT Southwestern Medical Center Department of Pathology, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131125,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC4177618,2013/11/28 06:00,2013/11/28 06:01,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['2050-7771-1-31 [pii]', '10.1186/2050-7771-1-31 [doi]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2013 Nov 25;1(1):31. doi: 10.1186/2050-7771-1-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress in basic, preclinical, and clinical arenas spanning cellular immunology, synthetic biology, and cell-processing technologies has paved the way for clinical applications of chimeric antigen receptor-based therapies. This new form of targeted immunotherapy merges the exquisite targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxicity and long-term persistence provided by cytotoxic T cells. Although this field is still in its infancy, clinical trials have already shown clinically significant antitumor activity in neuroblastoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and B cell lymphoma, and trials targeting a variety of other adult and pediatric malignancies are under way. Ongoing work is focused on identifying optimal tumor targets and on elucidating and manipulating both cell- and host-associated factors to support expansion and persistence of the genetically engineered cells in vivo. The potential to target essentially any tumor-associated cell-surface antigen for which a monoclonal antibody can be made opens up an entirely new arena for targeted therapy of cancer.","['Barrett, David M', 'Singh, Nathan', 'Porter, David L', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'June, Carl H']","['Barrett DM', 'Singh N', 'Porter DL', 'Grupp SA', 'June CH']","['Abramson Cancer Center and the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, and Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104; email: barrettd@email.chop.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131120,United States,Annu Rev Med,Annual review of medicine,2985151R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Cell Engineering', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', '*Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*transplantation']",PMC4120077,2013/11/28 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2013/11/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1146/annurev-med-060512-150254 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Med. 2014;65:333-47. doi: 10.1146/annurev-med-060512-150254.

In its initial chronic phase, the myeloid progenitor cells expand and demonstrate apparently normal differentiation. The disease may then transform into the accelerated phase, usually associated with resistance to therapy, and finally, into acute leukemic progression phase - blast crisis. Abnormal myeloid cells produce progenitors, which have lost their ability to differentiate, but retain the capacity to proliferate. The molecular hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from reciprocal chromosome translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), and containing the BCR/ABL fusion gene, producing the BCR/ABL protein with a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. BCR/ABL-positive cells have faster growth and proliferation over their normal counterparts and are resistant to apoptosis. Introduction of imatinib (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, revolutionized the therapy of CML, changing it from a fatal disease into a chronic disorder. However, some patients show a primary resistance to IM, others acquire such resistance in the course of therapy. Therefore, a small number of leukemic stem cells retains self-renewal capacity under IM treatment. Because BCR/ABL is involved in many signaling pathways, some of them may be essential for resistance to IM-induced apoptosis. The PI3K/AKT, Ras and JAK/STAT signaling pathways are involved in resistance to apoptosis and can be activated by BCR/ABL. Therefore, they can be candidates for BCR/ABL-dependent pro-survival pathway(s), allowing a fraction of CML cells to withstand treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Danisz, Katarzyna', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Danisz K', 'Blasiak J']","['Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131122,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['2013_488 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2013;60(4):503-14.

Genetic variants that help define patient's sensitivity to anthracyclines will greatly improve the design of optimal chemotherapeutic regimens. However, identification of such variants is hampered by the lack of analytical approaches that address the complex, multi-genic character of anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity (AIC). Here, using a multi-SNP based approach, we examined 60 genes coding for proteins involved in drug metabolism and efflux and identified the P450 oxidoreductase (POR) gene to be most strongly associated with daunorubicin induced cardiotoxicity in a population of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (FDR adjusted p-value of 0.15). In this sample of cancer patients, variation in the POR gene is estimated to account for some 11.6% of the variability in the drop of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after daunorubicin treatment, compared to the estimated 13.2% accounted for by the cumulative dose and ethnicity. In post-hoc analysis, this association was driven by 3 SNPs-the rs2868177, rs13240755, and rs4732513-through their linear interaction with cumulative daunorubicin dose. The unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for rs2868177 and rs13240755 were estimated to be 1.89 (95% CI: 0.7435-4.819; p = 0.1756) and 3.18 (95% CI: 1.223-8.27; p = 0.01376), respectively. Although the contribution of POR variants is expected to be overestimated due to the multiple testing performed in this small pilot study, given that cumulative anthracycline dose is virtually the only factor used clinically to predict the risk of cardiotoxicity, the contribution that genetic analyses of POR can make to the assessment of this risk is worthy of follow up in future investigations.","['Lubieniecka, Joanna M', 'Graham, Jinko', 'Heffner, Daniel', 'Mottus, Randy', 'Reid, Ronald', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Grigliatti, Tom A', 'Riggs, Wayne K']","['Lubieniecka JM', 'Graham J', 'Heffner D', 'Mottus R', 'Reid R', 'Hogge D', 'Grigliatti TA', 'Riggs WK']","['Department of Zoology, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia Vancouver, BC, Canada ; Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Simon Fraser University Burnaby, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131111,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC3822292,2013/11/26 06:00,2013/11/26 06:01,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2013.00231 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2013 Nov 11;4:231. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2013.00231. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['P450 oxidoreductase variants', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'adverse drug reactions', 'anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity', 'complex trait', 'daunorubicin', 'global test']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the expression lever of Bax was distinctly increased whereas Bcl2 was dramatically decreased in transfected group. Further experiments revealed that down-regulation of GINS2 expression inhibited DNA replication and had a G2/M phase block in HL60 cells.

RESULTS: Compared with those in non-infected group and EBV- or HCMV-infected group, the methylation levels of PTEN gene in the co-infected group were significantly decreased (P<0.05) while the methylation levels of hTERT gene significantly increased (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, EBV and HCMV co-infection cause changes in the methylation levels of PTEN and hTERT. These results may be associated with epigenetic changes caused by viral infections, and further studies are needed to further verify this hypothesis.","['Qi, Xinkun', 'Shu, Yi', 'Qin, Ru', 'Zou, Lin']","['Qi X', 'Shu Y', 'Qin R', 'Zou L']","[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University/ Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/ Chongqing Municipal Key Laboratory of Pediatrics/Chongqing Municipal Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technical Research Center, Chongqing 400014, China.E-mail: xinkun00001@163.com.""]",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Coinfection', 'Cytomegalovirus/isolation & purification', '*Cytomegalovirus Infections', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2013 Nov;33(11):1678-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They all play important roles in extending the host range and tumour development. In the present study, one ALV-J strain (ZB110604-6) from Black-Bone Silky Fowl (BSF) and three ALV-J strains (ZB110604-3/4/5) from grey partridge (GP), which bore multiple tumours and breed in one house of Farm A, were demonstrated extending their host to GP, while two other ALV-J strains (LC110515-3/4) from BSF of Farm B could not infect the embryo fibroblast of GP. The BSF is a unique species of chicken in China, while the GP is a close relative of the pheasant that previously demonstrated resistance to ALV-J. Histopathology showed that various tumours were induced by ALV-J in the two species. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the isolates from Farms A and B, rather than species, belong to two different clusters of ALV-J. Genetic mutations analysis revealed that the isolates obtained from Farm A showed a higher frequency of mutation in the hypervariable region 2 domain than in other variable regions of the gp85 gene. From the nucleotide alignment of the 3' UTR and 3' LTR gene, and the spectrum of tumours observed in this study, we speculate that the deletions or mutations in the redundant transmembrane region, E element and U3 (CAAT boxes, CArG box and Y box) might associate with tumour formation and development. The extension of the host range of ALV-J to the GP suggested that housing different species together provides more opportunities for ALV-J to evolve rapidly.","['Shen, Yanwei', 'Cai, Liming', 'Wang, Yanming', 'Wei, Rongrong', 'He, Menglian', 'Wang, Shanhui', 'Wang, Guihua', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Shen Y', 'Cai L', 'Wang Y', 'Wei R', 'He M', 'Wang S', 'Wang G', 'Cheng Z']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, PR China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, PR China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, PR China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, PR China."", 'Vocation College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Wei Fang 261061, PR China.', 'Xuzhou Vocation College of Bioengineering, Xu Zhou 221006, PR China.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, PR China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131122,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Galliformes', '*Host Specificity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.059915-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2014 Mar;95(Pt 3):691-699. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.059915-0.

Of those, expression of ZFP91 (ZFP91 zinc finger protein) was notably upregulated. Limited data concerning the function of ZFP91 product show that it is a potential transcription factor upregulated in human acute myelogenous leukemia and most recently found to be the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway regulator. In order to test this finding on a larger number of samples, prostate specimens were obtained from patients undergoing adenomectomy for BPH (n = 21), and as a control, from patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (prostates unchanged pathologically, n = 18). Similar studies were performed on cultured human prostate cancer cell lines: LNCaP, DU145, 22Rv1, PC-3; as well as normal prostate epithelial cells-PrEC. Methods employed included: Human Obesity PCR Array (Qiagen), QPCR and Western blotting. QPCR studies confirmed significant overexpression of ZFP91 in BPH samples. On a protein level, however, comparison between normal and BPH prostates revealed insignificant differences. As for prostate cell lines examined, all expressed ZFP91 mRNA. Western blotting analysis showed markedly higher protein levels of ZFP91 in all cancer cell lines in comparison with normal (PrEC) cells. In conclusion, the upregulated ZFP91 mRNA in BPH, not accompanied by parallel changes in ZFP91 protein levels, together with ZFP91 protein abundance in prostate cancer cell lines suggest ZFP91 involvement in these prostate diseases.","['Paschke, Lukasz', 'Rucinski, Marcin', 'Ziolkowska, Agnieszka', 'Zemleduch, Tomasz', 'Malendowicz, Witold', 'Kwias, Zbigniew', 'Malendowicz, Ludwik K']","['Paschke L', 'Rucinski M', 'Ziolkowska A', 'Zemleduch T', 'Malendowicz W', 'Kwias Z', 'Malendowicz LK']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 6 Swiecicki St., 60-781, Poznan, Poland, paschkelukasz@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131123,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ZFP91 protein, human)']",IM,"['Epithelial Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostate/*pathology', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/genetics/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",PMC3973948,2013/11/26 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-013-9716-z [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2014 Apr;20(2):453-9. doi: 10.1007/s12253-013-9716-z.

SBL was later shown to be identical to a ribonuclease (RC-RNase) from oocytes of the same species. The administration of SBL/RC-RNase induced apoptosis (with nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation) in mouse leukemia P388 cells but did not kill umbilical vein endothelial or fibroblast cells derived from normal tissues. The cytotoxic activity of SBL/RC-RNase was inhibited by desialylation of P388 cells and/or the co-presence of free bovine submaxillary mucin. FACS analysis showed that SBL/RC-RNase was incorporated into cells after attachment to cholesterol-rich microdomains. Addition of the cholesterol remover methyl-beta-cyclodextrin reduced SBL/RC-RNase-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis occurred through the caspase-3 pathway following activation of caspase-8 by SBL/RC-RNase. A heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70) and a heat shock protein (Hsp70) (each 70 kDa) on the cell membrane were shown to bind to SBL/RC-RNase by mass spectrometric and flow cytometric analyses. Quercetin, an inhibitor of Hsc70 and Hsp70, significantly reduced SBL/RC-RNase-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that sialyl-glycoconjugates present in cholesterol-rich microdomains form complexes with Hsc70 or Hsp70 that act as triggers for SBL/RC-RNase to induce apoptosis through a pathway involving the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8.","['Ogawa, Y', 'Sugawara, S', 'Tatsuta, T', 'Hosono, M', 'Nitta, K', 'Fujii, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Fujimura, T', 'Taka, H', 'Koide, Y', 'Hasan, I', 'Matsumoto, R', 'Yasumitsu, H', 'Kanaly, R A', 'Kawsar, S M A', 'Ozeki, Y']","['Ogawa Y', 'Sugawara S', 'Tatsuta T', 'Hosono M', 'Nitta K', 'Fujii Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Fujimura T', 'Taka H', 'Koide Y', 'Hasan I', 'Matsumoto R', 'Yasumitsu H', 'Kanaly RA', 'Kawsar SM', 'Ozeki Y']","['Divisions of Microbiology and Functional Morphology, Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Nagasaki International University, 2825-7 Huis Ten Bosch, Sasebo, Nagasaki, 859-3298, Japan, yogawa@niu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131124,United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,"['0 (Glycoconjugates)', '0 (HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cholesterol/*chemistry', 'Glycoconjugates/*metabolism', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388', 'Membrane Microdomains/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Mice', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/chemistry', 'Oocytes/*enzymology', 'Rana catesbeiana', 'Ribonucleases/*metabolism']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10719-013-9513-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2014 Feb;31(2):171-84. doi: 10.1007/s10719-013-9513-7.

The isolation of ccf-DNA from plasma as a ""liquid biopsy"" may begin to replace more invasive tissue biopsies for the detection and analysis of cancer-related mutations. Conventional methods for the isolation of ccf-DNA from plasma are costly, time-consuming, and complex, preventing the use of ccf-DNA biomarkers for point-of-care diagnostics and limiting other biomedical research applications. METHODS: We used an AC electrokinetic device to rapidly isolate ccf-DNA from 25 muL unprocessed blood. ccf-DNA from 15 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and 3 healthy individuals was separated into dielectrophoretic (DEP) high-field regions, after which other blood components were removed by a fluidic wash. Concentrated ccf-DNA was detected by fluorescence and eluted for quantification, PCR, and DNA sequencing. The complete process, blood to PCR, required <10 min. ccf-DNA was amplified by PCR with immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV)-specific primers to identify the unique IGHV gene expressed by the leukemic B-cell clone, and then sequenced. RESULTS: PCR and DNA sequencing results obtained by DEP from 25 muL CLL blood matched results obtained by use of conventional methods for ccf-DNA isolation from 1 mL plasma and for genomic DNA isolation from CLL patient leukemic B cells isolated from 15-20 mL blood. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid isolation of ccf-DNA directly from a drop of blood will advance disease-related biomarker research, accelerate the transition from tissue to liquid biopsies, and enable point-of-care diagnostic systems for patient monitoring.","['Sonnenberg, Avery', 'Marciniak, Jennifer Y', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Skowronski, Elaine A', 'Manouchehri, Sareh', 'McCanna, James', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Heller, Michael J']","['Sonnenberg A', 'Marciniak JY', 'Rassenti L', 'Ghia EM', 'Skowronski EA', 'Manouchehri S', 'McCanna J', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Kipps TJ', 'Heller MJ']",['Department of Bioengineering.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131122,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC4114224,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/05/08 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2013.214874 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2013.214874 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2014 Mar;60(3):500-9. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2013.214874.

Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, has demonstrated a significant clinical activity against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in early clinical trials. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of action would shed light on CLL pathophysiology and provide additional opportunities for the development of new therapies. In this study, we have chosen an in vivo approach by employing an ongoing phase 1b trial of ibrutinib. We prospectively collected and analyzed serial samples from the CLL patients before and after the initiation of ibrutinib. We found that the blockage of cell proliferation was one of the primary effects of ibrutinib against leukemic CLL cells in vivo. Using a co-culture system that induces CLL proliferation in vitro, analysis of several parameters, including Ki-67 expression and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, revealed that the proliferation of CLL cells was directly inhibited by ibrutinib. Furthermore, activities of BTK and phospholipase Cgamma2 as well as downstream signaling molecules, AKT and ERK, were all coordinately downregulated over time in ibrutinib-treated patients. Our findings suggest that the cell proliferation is one of the essential properties of CLL. Blocking cell proliferation via inhibition of BTK-mediated signaling may contribute to clinical responses in ibrutinib-treated patients.","['Cheng, S', 'Ma, J', 'Guo, A', 'Lu, P', 'Leonard, J P', 'Coleman, M', 'Liu, M', 'Buggy, J J', 'Furman, R R', 'Wang, Y L']","['Cheng S', 'Ma J', 'Guo A', 'Lu P', 'Leonard JP', 'Coleman M', 'Liu M', 'Buggy JJ', 'Furman RR', 'Wang YL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013358 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.358 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Mar;28(3):649-57. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.358.

Great interest emerged in modulating miRNA expression for therapeutic purposes. In order to identify miRNAs, which specifically suppress leukemic growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21), inv(16) or mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangement by inducing differentiation, we conducted a miRNA expression profiling in a cohort of 90 cytogenetically characterized, de novo pediatric AML cases. Four miRNAs, specifically downregulated in MLL-rearranged, t(8;21) or inv(16) AMLs, were characterized by their tumor-suppressive properties in cell lines representing those respective cytogenetic groups. Among those, forced expression of miR-9 reduced leukemic growth and induced monocytic differentiation of t(8;21) AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. The tumor-suppressive functions of miR-9 were specifically restricted to AML cell lines and primary leukemic blasts with t(8;21). On the other hand, these functions were not evident in AML blasts from patients with MLL rearrangements. We showed that miR-9 exerts its effects through the cooperation with let-7 to repress the oncogenic LIN28B/HMGA2 axis. Thus, miR-9 is a tumor suppressor-miR which acts in a stringent cell context-dependent manner.","['Emmrich, S', 'Katsman-Kuipers, J E', 'Henke, K', 'Khatib, M E', 'Jammal, R', 'Engeland, F', 'Dasci, F', 'Zwaan, C M', 'den Boer, M L', 'Verboon, L', 'Stary, J', 'Baruchel, A', 'de Haas, V', 'Danen-van Oorschot, A A', 'Fornerod, M', 'Pieters, R', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Klusmann, J H', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M']","['Emmrich S', 'Katsman-Kuipers JE', 'Henke K', 'Khatib ME', 'Jammal R', 'Engeland F', 'Dasci F', 'Zwaan CM', 'den Boer ML', 'Verboon L', 'Stary J', 'Baruchel A', 'de Haas V', 'Danen-van Oorschot AA', 'Fornerod M', 'Pieters R', 'Reinhardt D', 'Klusmann JH', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Hematology, St. Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology/Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/07/11 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013357 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.357 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 May;28(5):1022-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.357.

We studied the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), PD-L2, programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) mRNA in CD34+ cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (N=124). Aberrant upregulation (2-fold) was observed in 34, 14, 15 and 8% of the patients. Increased expression of these four genes was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) (N=61). The relative expression of PD-L1 from PBMNC was significantly higher in MDS (P=0.018) and CMML (P=0.0128) compared with AML. By immunohistochemical analysis, PD-L1 protein expression was observed in MDS CD34+ cells, whereas stroma/non-blast cellular compartment was positive for PD-1. In a cohort of patients treated with epigenetic therapy, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1 and CTLA4 expression was upregulated. Patients resistant to therapy had relative higher increments in gene expression compared with patients who achieved response. Treatment of leukemia cells with decitabine resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of above genes. Exposure to decitabine resulted in partial demethylation of PD-1 in leukemia cell lines and human samples. This study suggests that PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to hypomethylating agents. Blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML.","['Yang, H', 'Bueso-Ramos, C', 'DiNardo, C', 'Estecio, M R', 'Davanlou, M', 'Geng, Q-R', 'Fang, Z', 'Nguyen, M', 'Pierce, S', 'Wei, Y', 'Parmar, S', 'Cortes, J', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Garcia-Manero, G']","['Yang H', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'DiNardo C', 'Estecio MR', 'Davanlou M', 'Geng QR', 'Fang Z', 'Nguyen M', 'Pierce S', 'Wei Y', 'Parmar S', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1LG2 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4032802,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013355 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.355 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jun;28(6):1280-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.355.

Here, we describe a novel BCP-ALL subset, switching BCP-ALL or swALL, which demonstrated monocytosis early during treatment. Despite their monocytic phenotype, 'monocytoids' share immunoreceptor gene rearrangements with leukemic B lymphoblasts. All swALLs demonstrated BCP-ALL with CD2 positivity and no MLL alterations, and the proportion of swALLs cases among BCP-ALLs was unexpectedly high (4%). The upregulation of CEBPalpha and demethylation of the CEBPA gene were significant in blasts at diagnosis, prior to the time when most of the switching occurs. Intermediate stages between CD14(neg)CD19(pos)CD34(pos) B lymphoblasts and CD14(pos)CD19(neg)CD34(neg) 'monocytoids' were detected, and changes in the expression of PAX5, PU1, M-CSFR, GM-CSFR and other genes accompanied the switch. Alterations in the Ikaros and ERG genes were more frequent in swALL patients; however, both were altered in only a minority of swALLs. Moreover, switching could be recapitulated in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Although children with swALL respond slowly to initial therapy, risk-based ALL therapy appears the treatment of choice for swALL. SwALL shows that transdifferentiating into monocytic lineage is specifically associated with CEBPalpha changes and CD2 expression.","['Slamova, L', 'Starkova, J', 'Fronkova, E', 'Zaliova, M', 'Reznickova, L', 'van Delft, F W', 'Vodickova, E', 'Volejnikova, J', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Polgarova, K', 'Cario, G', 'Figueroa, M', 'Kalina, T', 'Fiser, K', 'Bourquin, J P', 'Bornhauser, B', 'Dworzak, M', 'Zuna, J', 'Trka, J', 'Stary, J', 'Hrusak, O', 'Mejstrikova, E']","['Slamova L', 'Starkova J', 'Fronkova E', 'Zaliova M', 'Reznickova L', 'van Delft FW', 'Vodickova E', 'Volejnikova J', 'Zemanova Z', 'Polgarova K', 'Cario G', 'Figueroa M', 'Kalina T', 'Fiser K', 'Bourquin JP', 'Bornhauser B', 'Dworzak M', 'Zuna J', 'Trka J', 'Stary J', 'Hrusak O', 'Mejstrikova E']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Centre of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'University of Michigan Medical School, Department of Pathology, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Division of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Division of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute and St. Anna Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20131125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (CD2 Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'CD2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013354 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.354 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Mar;28(3):609-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.354.

The present study focused on addressing the anticancer activity and molecular mechanism of methanol extract of Smilax china L. (MESC) in MC3 human oral MEC cells. The results indicated that MESC inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in MC3 cells. These observations were found to correlate with increases in truncated BH3 interactingdomain death agonist and Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) interacting mediator of cell death, but not Bcl2 homologous antagonist killer, Bcl2associated X protein, Bcl2, Bcell lymphomaextra large and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein levels. MESC also damaged the mitochondrial membrane potential, cleaved caspase8 protein and increased death receptor 5 (DR5) protein levels by enhancing the stability of DR5 protein. Furthermore, MESC affected the phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) only, and did not affect cJun Nterminal kinase or p38 phosphorylation.

Here, we found that NPC patients had increased serum levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and that higher LIF levels correlated with local tumor recurrence. Furthermore, in vitro studies with NPC cells and in vivo xenograft mouse studies demonstrated that LIF critically contributes to NPC tumor growth and radioresistance. Using these model systems, we found that LIF treatment activated the mTORC1/p70S6K signaling pathway, enhanced tumor growth, inhibited DNA damage responses, and enhanced radioresistance. Treatment with either soluble LIF receptor (sLIFR), a LIF antagonist, or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reversed LIF-mediated effects, resulting in growth arrest and increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of human NPC biopsies revealed that LIF and LIFR were overexpressed in tumor cells and that LIF expression correlated with the presence of the activated p-p70S6K. Finally, we found that the EBV-encoded protein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) enhances LIF production. Together, our findings indicate that LIF promotes NPC tumorigenesis and suggest that serum LIF levels may predict local recurrence and radiosensitivity in NPC patients.","['Liu, Shu-Chen', 'Tsang, Ngan-Ming', 'Chiang, Wen-Che', 'Chang, Kai-Ping', 'Hsueh, Chuen', 'Liang, Ying', 'Juang, Jyh-Lyh', 'Chow, Kai-Ping N', 'Chang, Yu-Sun']","['Liu SC', 'Tsang NM', 'Chiang WC', 'Chang KP', 'Hsueh C', 'Liang Y', 'Juang JL', 'Chow KP', 'Chang YS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma/blood/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'DNA Damage', 'Disease Progression', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/*physiology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiprotein Complexes/physiology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/blood/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/physiology']",PMC3859424,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['63428 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI63428 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 Dec;123(12):5269-83. doi: 10.1172/JCI63428.

To gain insight into the mechanisms that promote shifts in DNA methylation and contribute to changes in cell fate, including malignant transformation, we performed genome-wide mapping of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in purified mouse hematopoietic stem cells. We discovered extended regions of low methylation (canyons) that span conserved domains frequently containing transcription factors and are distinct from CpG islands and shores. About half of the genes in these methylation canyons are coated with repressive histone marks, whereas the remainder are covered by activating histone marks and are highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Canyon borders are demarked by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and become eroded in the absence of DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a). Genes dysregulated in human leukemias are enriched for canyon-associated genes.

Data on the comparative effectiveness of antifungal prophylaxis in this population are limited. METHODS: A pediatric AML cohort was assembled from the Pediatric Health Information System database using ICD-9 codes and pharmacy data. Antifungal prophylaxis status was determined by pharmaceutical data review within 21 days of starting induction chemotherapy. Patients were followed until end of induction, death, or loss to follow-up. Cox regression analyses compared induction mortality and resources utilized between patients receiving and not receiving antifungal prophylaxis. A propensity score accounted for variation in demographic factors, location of care, and severity of illness at presentation. RESULTS: Eight hundred seventy-one AML patients were identified; the induction case fatality rate was 3.7%. In the adjusted Cox regression model, patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis (57%) had a decreased hazard for induction mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], .19-.90). Children receiving prophylaxis were less frequently exposed to broad-spectrum gram-positive (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.87; 95% CI, .79-.97) and antipseudomonal beta-lactam agents (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, .85-.96), had fewer blood cultures (IRR, 0.78; 95% CI, .71-.86), and had fewer chest CT scans (IRR, 0.73; 95% CI, .60-.88). CONCLUSIONS: Antifungal prophylaxis in pediatric AML patients was associated with reduced induction mortality rates and supportive care resources. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether antifungal prophylaxis should include antimold activity.","['Fisher, Brian T', 'Kavcic, Marko', 'Li, Yimei', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Zaoutis, Theoklis', 'Torp, Kari', 'Leckerman, Kateri H', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Fisher BT', 'Kavcic M', 'Li Y', 'Seif AE', 'Bagatell R', 'Huang YS', 'Zaoutis T', 'Torp K', 'Leckerman KH', 'Aplenc R']",['Division of Infectious Diseases.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131123,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chemoprevention/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*mortality/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3905759,2013/11/26 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['cit781 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/cit781 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2014 Feb;58(4):502-8. doi: 10.1093/cid/cit781.

The prevalence is low at approximately 1 in 10 000 pregnancies, and as a result data are limited to small retrospective series and case reports, rendering evidence-based recommendations for management strategies difficult. The management of the leukemias in pregnancy requires close collaboration with obstetric and neonatology colleagues as both the maternal and fetal outcomes must be taken into consideration. The decision to introduce or delay chemotherapy must be balanced against the impact on maternal and fetal survival and morbidity. Invariably, acute leukemia diagnosed in the first trimester necessitates intensive chemotherapy that is likely to induce fetal malformations. As delaying treatment in this situation is usually inappropriate, counseling with regard to termination of pregnancy is often essential. For chronic disease and acute leukemia diagnosed after the second trimester, therapeutic termination of the pregnancy is not inevitable and often, standard management approaches similar to those in nongravid patients can be used.

Here, we report that adrenal glucocorticoids (GC) released during psychosocial stress protect photoreceptors from apoptosis after light damage. Psychosocial stress is known to be the main type of stressor humans are exposed to and was induced here in mice by 10h of chronic subordinate colony housing (CSC). Photoreceptor damage was generated by subsequent exposure to white light. Short-term psychosocial stress prior to illumination significantly reduced the number of apoptotic photoreceptors, an effect that was absent in adrenalectomized (ADX) mice. The neuroprotective effect was completely restored in ADX mice substituted with GC. Moreover, phosphorylation of retinal AKT increased following CSC or exogenous GC treatment, an effect that was again absent in ADX mice exposed to CSC. Finally, inhibition of AKT signaling with triciribine blocked the stress- and GC-mediated neuroprotective effects on photoreceptors. In summary, we provide evidence that 1) short-term psychosocial stress protects photoreceptors from light-induced damage and 2) the protective effect is most likely mediated by GC-induced activation of the AKT signaling pathway.","['Forkwa, Tembei K', 'Neumann, Inga D', 'Tamm, Ernst R', 'Ohlmann, Andreas', 'Reber, Stefan O']","['Forkwa TK', 'Neumann ID', 'Tamm ER', 'Ohlmann A', 'Reber SO']","['Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Behavioral and Molecular Neurobiology, Institute of Zoology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.

However, the role in leukemogenesis of wild-type (wt) FLT3, which is highly expressed in many hematologic malignancies, is unclear. We show here that in mouse models established by retroviral transduction of leukemic fusion proteins, deletion of Flt3 strongly inhibits MLL-ENL and to lesser extent p210(BCR-ABL)-induced leukemogenesis, but has no effect in MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a models. Flt3 acts at the level of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), as a fraction of LSCs in MLL-ENL, but not in MLL-AF9-induced leukemia, expressed Flt3 in vivo, and Flt3 expression on LSCs was associated with leukemia development in this model. Furthermore, efficiency of MLL-ENL, but not of MLL-AF9-induced leukemia induction was significantly enhanced after transduction of Flt3(+) compared to Flt3(-) wt myeloid progenitors. However, Flt3 is not required for immortalization of bone marrow cells in vitro by MLL-ENL and does not affect colony formation by MLL-ENL LSCs in vitro, suggesting that in vitro models do not reflect the in vivo biology of MLL-ENL leukemia with respect to Flt3 requirement. We conclude that wt Flt3 plays a role in leukemia initiation in vivo, which is, however, not universal.","['Kamezaki, Kenjiro', 'Luchsinger, Larry L', 'Snoeck, Hans-Willem']","['Kamezaki K', 'Luchsinger LL', 'Snoeck HW']","['Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

However, the significance of such differential expression to clinical disease behavior is unknown. Using the CML-derived, BCR-ABL expressing cell line, K562, distinct plastic-adherent (K562/Adh) and nonadherent (K562/NonAdh) subpopulations were established and then analyzed both as single cells and as bulk cell populations. BCR-ABL mRNA was upregulated in K562/Adh compared with K562/NonAdh cells in both single cell and bulk population analyses (p < 0.0001). Similarly, phosphorylation of BCR protein was upregulated in K562/Adh, compared with K562/NonAdh cells (63.42% vs. 23.1%; p = 0.007), and these two K562 subpopulations were found to express significantly different microRNA species. Furthermore, treatment with the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, reduced cell viability more rapidly in K562/NonAdh compared with K562/Adh cells (p < 0.005) both at single and bulk cell levels. This discovery of an adherent subpopulation of K562 cells with increased BCR-ABL mRNA, increased phosphorylated BCR protein expression, differential microRNA expression, and increased imatinib resistance suggests that a similar subpopulation of cells can also mediate clinical resistance to imatinib during treatment of patients with CML.","['Karimiani, Ehsan Ghayoor', 'Marriage, Fiona', 'Merritt, Anita J', 'Burthem, John', 'Byers, Richard John', 'Day, Philip J R']","['Karimiani EG', 'Marriage F', 'Merritt AJ', 'Burthem J', 'Byers RJ', 'Day PJ']","['Institute of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, and Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, and Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Histopathology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, and Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom; Department of Hematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, and Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom; Department of Hematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.

Therefore development of novel agents triggering apoptosis and have low toxicity towards normal cells is most important. Hydroxamic acids suppress tumour cell growth through apoptosis but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Herein, we describe the apoptotic potential of a dibasic hydroxamic acid derivative, viz., oxayl bis (N-phenyl) hydroxamic acid (OBPHA), which induces apoptosis through generation of both ROS and NO in doxorubicin resistant T-lymphoblastic leukemia, CEM/ADR5000 cells. Present study discloses that OBPHA selectively kills cancerous cells irrespective of their drug resistant phenotype. We also determined the crystal structure of OBPHA to understand the structural requirements for apoptosis; the study reveals that the presence of substituted hydroxamic acid groups (-CO-NH-OH) favours the generation of NO possibly through auto degeneration. Along with the induction of caspase 3 mediated intrinsic apoptosis; OBPHA also activates p53 dependent signalling cascade and downregulates HDAC3 expression in a time dependent manner possibly due to increased ROS and NO production and simultaneous decrease in cellular GSH level. Thus ROS and NO mediated downstream signalling are essential for the anticancer effect of OBPHA. Therefore OBPHA, having a structurally relevant pharmacophore provides important insight into the development of new ROS and RNS generating chemicals inducing p53 dependent apoptosis.","['Banerjee, Kaushik', 'Ganguly, Avishek', 'Chakraborty, Paramita', 'Sarkar, Avijit', 'Singh, Suryabhan', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Bhattacharya, Subrato', 'Choudhuri, Soumitra Kumar']","['Banerjee K', 'Ganguly A', 'Chakraborty P', 'Sarkar A', 'Singh S', 'Chatterjee M', 'Bhattacharya S', 'Choudhuri SK']","['Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.', 'Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.

The microenvironment of AML is immunosuppressive, favoring the survival of malignant hematopoietic cells. However, the systematic research on AML abnormal immune microenvironment, especially the T helper (Th) cells imbalance, remains unsettled. DESIGN AND METHODS: The levels of cytokines in bone marrow plasma including Th1-associated cytokine (IFN-gamma), Th2-associated cytokine (IL-4), Th17-associated cytokines (IL-17, IL-6, TGF-beta, and IL-21), regulatory T cell (Treg)-associated cytokines (IL-35 and IL-10) and Th22-associated cytokine (IL-22) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in AML patients and controls. The relative expression levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-21 mRNA were analyzed by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Significant differences on cytokine levels tested were observed among the AML newly-diagnosed (ND) patients, AML patients in complete remission (CR) and controls except IL-21 and IL-35. In AML-ND group IFN-gamma level was positively correlated with IL-21 or IL-22 level. Additionally, significant associations were observed between IL-17, IL-21 and some clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that many cytokines were abnormal in AML bone marrow microenvironment. The dysregulation of Th subsets cytokines is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of AML.","['Sun, Yuan-xin', 'Kong, Hai-li', 'Liu, Chuan-fang', 'Yu, Shuang', 'Tian, Tian', 'Ma, Dao-xin', 'Ji, Chun-yan']","['Sun YX', 'Kong HL', 'Liu CF', 'Yu S', 'Tian T', 'Ma DX', 'Ji CY']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital, 46 Lishan Road, Jinan, Shandong 250013, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 West Wenhua Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.

Our results showed increased frequencies of HLA-A11:01 (p=0.02) and HLA-B35:01 (p=0.002) alleles and HLA-A11:01/B35:01 haplotype (p=0.036) and decreased frequencies of HLA-A01:01 (p=0.02), HLA-A26:01 (p=0.03), HLA-B65:01 (p=0.03) and HLA-B53:01 (p<0.00001) alleles in CLL patients compared to the control group. Classification of the patients into non-progressive and progressive groups did not reveal significant differences for the frequency of any of the HLA-A and -B alleles or haplotypes between these two subtypes. Comparison between patients with immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHV) mutated (n=56) and unmutated (n=31) subtypes showed a significant increase in HLA-A32:01 (p=0.05) and HLA-A33:01 (p=0.05) alleles in IGHV unmutated patients compared to IGHV mutated patients. Similarly, a higher frequency of HLA-B52:01 (p=0.037) alleles was observed in CD38(+) compared with CD38(-) patients. Our results obtained from an Iranian population indicate that CLL is associated with distinct HLA class I alleles and haplotypes some of which are linked to disease prognostic factors.","['Hojjat-Farsangi, M', 'Razavi, S M', 'Sharifian, R A', 'Shokri, F']","['Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Razavi SM', 'Sharifian RA', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Firozgar Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Vali-Asr Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.

Previous work demonstrated that granulysin caused cell death through mitochondrial damage with release of AIF and cytochrome c. However, the molecular mechanism and, especially, the type of cell death were still not well defined. In the present work we show that granulysin-induced cell death is apoptotic, with phosphatidylserine exposure preceding membrane breakdown and with caspase 3 activation. Granulysin-induced apoptosis is prevented in Jurkat cells over-expressing Bcl-xL or Bcl2, or lacking Bak and Bax or Bim expression, suggesting a central role of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This apoptotic process is initiated by intracellular Ca(2+) increase and mitochondrial ROS generation. We have tested granulysin against other hematological tumor cells such as multiple myeloma cell lines, and cells from B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients, finding different degrees of sensitivity. We also show that granulysin induces the cleavage of Atg5 in the complex formed with Atg12, without affecting autophagy. In conclusion, granulysin induces apoptosis on hematological tumor cells and on cells from B-CLL patients, opening the door to research on its use as a new anti-tumoral treatment.","['Aporta, Adriana', 'Catalan, Elena', 'Galan-Malo, Patricia', 'Ramirez-Labrada, Ariel', 'Perez, Marta', 'Azaceta, Gemma', 'Palomera, Luis', 'Naval, Javier', 'Marzo, Isabel', 'Pardo, Julian', 'Anel, Alberto']","['Aporta A', 'Catalan E', 'Galan-Malo P', 'Ramirez-Labrada A', 'Perez M', 'Azaceta G', 'Palomera L', 'Naval J', 'Marzo I', 'Pardo J', 'Anel A']","['Apoptosis, Immunity & Cancer Group, Dept.

Here, we compared the abnormality detection rate of clinically requested testing (i.e., G-banded chromosome analysis and FISH) with high-resolution oligo (i.e., array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/oligo hybrid (i.e., SNP-CGH) arrays in a series of patients, in an effort to assess the ability of newer technologies to overcome these limitations. This series found the detection rate for SNP-CGH to be 62.5% for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases and 72.7% for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases, which are significantly higher than the detection rates of aCGH (31.3% for MDS and 54.5% for CLL) and G-banding and/or FISH (43.8% for MDS and 54.5% for CLL). This demonstrates the advantages of combining SNP-CGH with conventional cytogenetics to provide comprehensive clinical information by detecting clonality, large balanced rearrangements, copy number aberrations, and CN-LOH.","['Xu, Xinjie', 'Johnson, Eric B', 'Leverton, Lisa', 'Arthur, Ashley', 'Watson, Quinn', 'Chang, Faye L', 'Raca, Gordana', 'Laffin, Jennifer J']","['Xu X', 'Johnson EB', 'Leverton L', 'Arthur A', 'Watson Q', 'Chang FL', 'Raca G', 'Laffin JJ']","['University of Wisconsin Cytogenetic Services, Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, Madison, WI, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20131024,United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding/methods', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/*methods', 'Early Detection of Cancer/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/02/01 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(13)00124-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2013.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2013 Sep-Oct;206(9-10):317-26. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2013.09.001.

Furthermore, we investigated the efficacy of hormonal therapy for men who failed to recover sperm after micro-TESE. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with PCA with the mean age of 34.6 years (range, 23-42) were included in this study. The cancer types included testicular cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and malignant pheochromocytoma. The mean interval from chemotherapy to micro-TESE was 14.8 years (range, 7-25), and the mean age of the female partners was 34.1 years. RESULTS: Sperm were retrieved in 11 (42%) of the patients. Six patients who did not obtain successful sperm retrieval underwent human chorionic gonadotropin-based hormonal therapy, and sperm were retrieved from 2 patients by a second micro-TESE. In total, 7 (27%) pregnancies and 5 (19%) live birth deliveries were achieved. Patients with PCA after testicular cancer treatment were able to achieve a high rate (75%) of sperm retrieval and that exposure to alkylating agents resulted in lower sperm retrieval rates. CONCLUSION: Micro-TESE-intracytoplasmic sperm injection is an effective fertility treatment for patients with PCA. Furthermore, patients who could not achieve successful sperm retrieval by micro-TESE might obtain improved outcomes with hormonal therapy, indicating that these treatments might provide the patients with PCA with the opportunity to retrieve sperm and father a child.","['Shiraishi, Koji', 'Matsuyama, Hideyasu']","['Shiraishi K', 'Matsuyama H']","['Department of Urology, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.

In tumors driven by mutant JAK2, Stat1, Stat3, Stat5, and the Pi3k and Mek/Erk pathways were constitutively active, and gene expression profiling of TEL-JAK2 T-ALL cells revealed the upregulation of prosurvival Bcl-2 family genes. Combining the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737 with JAK2 inhibitors mediated prolonged disease regressions and cures in mice bearing primary human and mouse JAK2 mutant tumors. Moreover, combined targeting of JAK2 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL was able to circumvent and overcome acquired resistance to single-agent JAK2 inhibitor treatment. Thus, inhibiting the oncogenic JAK2 signaling network at two nodal points, at the initiating stage (JAK2) and the effector stage (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL), is highly effective and provides a clearly superior therapeutic benefit than targeting just one node. Therefore, we have defined a potentially curative treatment for hematological malignancies expressing constitutively active JAK2.","['Waibel, Michaela', 'Solomon, Vanessa S', 'Knight, Deborah A', 'Ralli, Rachael A', 'Kim, Sang-Kyu', 'Banks, Kellie-Marie', 'Vidacs, Eva', 'Virely, Clemence', 'Sia, Keith C S', 'Bracken, Lauryn S', 'Collins-Underwood, Racquel', 'Drenberg, Christina', 'Ramsey, Laura B', 'Meyer, Sara C', 'Takiguchi, Megumi', 'Dickins, Ross A', 'Levine, Ross', 'Ghysdael, Jacques', 'Dawson, Mark A', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Johnstone, Ricky W']","['Waibel M', 'Solomon VS', 'Knight DA', 'Ralli RA', 'Kim SK', 'Banks KM', 'Vidacs E', 'Virely C', 'Sia KC', 'Bracken LS', 'Collins-Underwood R', 'Drenberg C', 'Ramsey LB', 'Meyer SC', 'Takiguchi M', 'Dickins RA', 'Levine R', 'Ghysdael J', 'Dawson MA', 'Lock RB', 'Mullighan CG', 'Johnstone RW']","['Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia.', 'Institut Curie, Centre Universitaire, Bat 110, 91405 Orsay, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 3306, Centre Universitaire, Bat 110, 91405 Orsay, France; Institut National de la Sante et al Recherche Medicale, Unite 1005, Centre Universitaire, Bat 110, 91405 Orsay, France.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, 2052 NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, 2052 NSW, Australia."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Medicine, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, 3052 VIC, Australia.', 'Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, 3052 VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Institut Curie, Centre Universitaire, Bat 110, 91405 Orsay, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 3306, Centre Universitaire, Bat 110, 91405 Orsay, France; Institut National de la Sante et al Recherche Medicale, Unite 1005, Centre Universitaire, Bat 110, 91405 Orsay, France.', ""Gurdon Institute and Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QN, UK; Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, 2052 NSW, Australia."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC, Australia; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, 3052 VIC, Australia.

Human fetal pancreatic stem cells have a better self-renewal capacity than adult stem cells and can readily differentiate into pancreatic endocrine cells, making them a potential source for islets in diabetes treatment. In the present study, the functions of pancreatic islets derived from human fetal pancreatic progenitor cells were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Human pancreatic progenitor cells isolated from the fetal pancreas were expanded and differentiated into islet endocrine cells in culture. Markers for endocrine and exocrine functions as well as those for alpha and beta cells were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To evaluate the functions of these islets in vivo, the islet-like structures were transplanted into renal capsules of diabetic nude mice. Immunohistochemical staining for human C-peptide and human mitochondrion antigen was applied to confirm the human origin and the survival of grafted islets. RESULTS: Human fetal pancreatic progenitor cells were able to expand in medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF), and to differentiate into pancreatic endocrine cells with high efficiency upon the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 and activin-A. The differentiated cells expressed insulin, glucagon, glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), GLUT2 and voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC), and were able to aggregate into islet-like structures containing alpha and beta cells upon suspension. These structures expressed and released a higher level of insulin than adhesion cultured cells, and helped to maintain normoglycemia in diabetic nude mice after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Human fetal pancreatic progenitor cells have good capacity for generating insulin producing cells and provide a promising potential source for diabetes treatment.","['Zhang, Wen-Jian', 'Xu, Shi-Qing', 'Cai, Han-Qing', 'Men, Xiu-Li', 'Wang, Zai', 'Lin, Hua', 'Chen, Li', 'Jiang, Yong-Wei', 'Liu, Hong-Lin', 'Li, Cheng-Hui', 'Sui, Wei-Guo', 'Deng, Hong-Kui', 'Lou, Jin-Ning']","['Zhang WJ', 'Xu SQ', 'Cai HQ', 'Men XL', 'Wang Z', 'Lin H', 'Chen L', 'Jiang YW', 'Liu HL', 'Li CH', 'Sui WG', 'Deng HK', 'Lou JN']",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (activin A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '89750-14-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 1)']",IM,"['Activins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/pathology/*surgery', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pancreas/*cytology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",PMC4055010,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['scrt352 [pii]', '10.1186/scrt352 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2013;4(6):141. doi: 10.1186/scrt352.,,,,,,,,,['Stem Cell Res Ther. 2013;4(6):159.

The presence of several chromatin related modules such as plant homeodomain (PHD), bromodomain and SAND domain suggests a role in chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression; however, its real function is still elusive. Herein we present the solution structure of Sp140-PHD finger and investigate its role as epigenetic reader in vitro. Sp140-PHD presents an atypical PHD finger fold which does not bind to histone H3 tails but is recognized by peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 specifically binds to a phosphopeptide corresponding to the L3 loop of Sp140-PHD and catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of a pThr-Pro bond. Moreover co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate FLAG-Sp140 interaction with endogenous Pin1 in vivo. Overall these data include Sp140 in the list of the increasing number of Pin1 binders and expand the regulatory potential of PHD fingers as versatile structural platforms for diversified interactions.","['Zucchelli, Chiara', 'Tamburri, Simone', 'Quilici, Giacomo', 'Palagano, Eleonora', 'Berardi, Andrea', 'Saare, Mario', 'Peterson, Part', 'Bachi, Angela', 'Musco, Giovanna']","['Zucchelli C', 'Tamburri S', 'Quilici G', 'Palagano E', 'Berardi A', 'Saare M', 'Peterson P', 'Bachi A', 'Musco G']","['Dulbecco Telethon Institute, c/o Biomolecular NMR Laboratory, S.

METHODS: We ascertained cancers within SLE registries at 10 pediatric centers. Subjects were linked to cancer registries for the observational interval, spanning 1974 to 2009. The ratio of observed to expected cancers represents the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or relative cancer risk in childhood-onset SLE, versus the general population. RESULTS: There were 1020 patients aged <18 at cohort entry. Most (82%) were female and Caucasian; mean age at cohort entry was 12.6 years (standard deviation (SD) = 3.6). Subjects were observed for a total of 7,986 (average 7.8) patient-years. Within this interval, only three invasive cancers were expected. However, 14 invasive cancers occurred with an SIR of 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6 to 7.8. Three hematologic cancers were found (two non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one leukemia), for an SIR of 5.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 15.2). The SIRs stratified by age group and sex, were similar across these strata. There was a trend for highest cancer occurrence 10 to 19 years after SLE diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an increased cancer risk in pediatric onset SLE versus the general population. In absolute terms, this represents relatively few events. Of note, risk may be highest only after patients have transferred to adult care.","['Bernatsky, Sasha', 'Clarke, Ann E', 'Labrecque, Jeremy', 'von Scheven, Emily', 'Schanberg, Laura E', 'Silverman, Earl D', 'Brunner, Hermine I', 'Haines, Kathleen A', 'Cron, Randy Q', ""O'Neil, Kathleen M"", 'Oen, Kiem', 'Rosenberg, Alan M', 'Duffy, Ciaran M', 'Joseph, Lawrence', 'Lee, Jennifer L', 'Kale, Mruganka', 'Turnbull, Elizabeth M', 'Ramsey-Goldman, Rosalind']","['Bernatsky S', 'Clarke AE', 'Labrecque J', 'von Scheven E', 'Schanberg LE', 'Silverman ED', 'Brunner HI', 'Haines KA', 'Cron RQ', ""O'Neil KM"", 'Oen K', 'Rosenberg AM', 'Duffy CM', 'Joseph L', 'Lee JL', 'Kale M', 'Turnbull EM', 'Ramsey-Goldman R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",PMC3978586,2013/11/26 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ar4388 [pii]', '10.1186/ar4388 [doi]']",ppublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2013;15(6):R198. doi: 10.1186/ar4388.,,,,,"['5R03CA149970-2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MOP-106431/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the glucocorticoid induction test and the clinical features and the prognosis of Chinese childhood ALL. METHOD: The study recruited 309 hospitalized patients (187 male and 122 female) with childhood ALL, the sex, age, initial WBC count, immunophenotype, chromosome and gene expression were recorded. After diagnosis, all patients received GC induction test for 7 days. Then they were divided into prednisone good response (PGR) group and prednisone poor response (PPR) group according to the peripheral lymphoblast count on D8. Early responses to chemotherapy and treatment outcomes of the patients in the two groups were also analyzed. RESULT: Of the 309 patients, 263 belonged to PGR group and 46 belonged to PPR group. Initial WBC count was higher in PPR group than in PGR group (86.30x10(9)/L vs. 30.97x10(9)/L, P < 0.01) . B lineage ALL showed more sensitive to GC than T-ALL (86.6% vs. 60%, P < 0.05). Different initial-risk-group's sensitivity to GC differed from one another (high-risk:51.4%, medium-risk: 82.7%, standard risk: 93.7%, P < 0.0125). There was no significant difference between two groups in chromosomal karyotypes (P > 0.05). BCR-ABL positive ALL showed lower sensitivity to GC (P < 0.05) , while MLL, TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1 positive rates in two groups were of no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Bone marrow was reviewed on D15 and D33, and the CR rates in PGR group were significantly higher than that in PPR group (D15: 60.5% vs. 32.6%, D33: 94.6% vs. 73.3%, P < 0.01) ; Minimal residual disease (MRD) levels were examined on D33, W12, and both were much lower in PGR group (D33: P < 0.01, W12: P < 0.05). Of the PGR group 215 patients (81.7%) remained continuously in complete remission (CCR) while only 28 cases (60.9%) in PPR group did so. The CCR rate was much higher in PGR group than that in PPR group (P < 0.01).

To further utilize the rich resources to develop suitable protocol for Chinese pediatric ALL, Shanghai Children's Medical Center and 4 other pioneer children's ALL treatment centers collaborated to start a multi-center clinical trial to assess the feasibility and efficacy of SCMC-ALL-2005 protocol and try to revise the protocol based on the evidences found in this study. METHOD: Totally 655 cases of ALL patients recruited in the trial between May 1st 2005 and April 30th 2009 were diagnosed, stratified and treated with the same criteria and protocol based on SCMC-ALL-2005. chi(2) test was used for assessing the distribution similarity among centers, and the survival function was studied by Kaplan-Meier curve and Log-Rank chi(2) test. Among them 599 cases (91.4%) completed the MIC diagnosis. Comparing the distribution of age, gender, immunotype, white blood cell count at diagnosis and risk stratification among centers, most of the P values were > 0.1 except P value of immunotype distribution which was 0.013. Till Sep. 30th 2011, 613 patients (93.6%) were followed up. The medium follow up period for survivals was 49.13 months. RESULT: The predicted 5-Year events free survival (EFS) was (69.9% +/- 2.1%), 5-year overall survival(OS) was (77.6% +/- 2.0%); 5-year relapse was (23.9% +/- 2.0%). Among different risk groups, the predicted 5-year EFS, OS and relapse rate for low-risk (LR) were (82.0% +/- 2.6%), (83.6% +/- 3.0%) and (16.1% +/- 2.5%) respectively; for medium-risk (MR) were (66.4% +/- 3.1%), (76.8% +/- 2.7%) and (26.3% +/- 3.0%) respectively; for high-risk (HR) were (27.4% +/- 9.3%), (48.9% +/- 7.3%) and (60.0% +/- 12.8%) respectively. Relapse was still the most important event which caused treatment failure (up to 59.5% of the failure). Herein relapsed, the most common relapse site was bone marrow (76.6% in those relapsed); the percentage of central nervous system relapse was 12.9% and the percentage of testis relapse in boys was 14.3%. Prognostic factor study indicated that higher peripheral white blood cell count at diagnosis, age younger than 1 year and molecular markers of BCR-ABL1 and MLL-AF4 predict the poorest outcomes. Survival curve analysis: survival platform started at 30 months in high risk group and at 50 months in medium risk group since the first chemotherapy. While in low risk group, there were two platforms at 20 months and 50 months. Between them was an obvious relapse peak. CONCLUSION: SCMC-ALL-2005 protocol was an effective and feasible protocol for childhood ALL to be adopted in most centers.

We developed a (177)Lu-labeled bcl-2 antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-peptide conjugate designed for dual modality NHL therapy, consisting of a radiopharmaceutical capable of simultaneously down-regulating apoptotic resistance and delivering cytotoxic internally emitted radiation. METHODS: DOTA-anti-bcl-2-Tyr(3)-octreotate was synthesized, labeled with (177)Lu, and purified using RP-HPLC. The PNA-peptide conjugate was evaluated in Mec-1 NHL-bearing mice and compared to [(177)Lu]DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate in biodistribution and excretion studies. These data were then used to generate in vivo dosimetry models. RESULTS: The PNA-peptide conjugate was readily prepared and radiolabeled in high yield and radiochemical purity. An in vivo blocking study determined that administration of 50 mug of non-radioactive PNA-peptide was the optimal mass for maximum delivery to the tumor. Based on that result, a dosing regimen of (177)Lu-PNA-peptide, for radiologic effect, followed by the optimal mass of non-radioactive compound, for antisense effect, was designed. Using that dosing regimen, biodistribution of the PNA-peptide showed uptake in the tumor with minimal washout over a 4-day period. Uptakes in receptor-positive normal organs were low and displayed nearly complete washout by 24h. Dosimetry models showed that the tumor absorbed dose of the PNA-peptide conjugate was approximately twice that of the peptide-only conjugate. CONCLUSIONS: Biodistribution data showed specific tumor targeting of the (177)Lu-labeled PNA-peptide compound with minimal receptor-positive normal tissue uptake when compared to [(177)Lu]DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate. In vivo dosimetry models predicted a more favorable tumor absorbed dose from [(177)Lu]DOTA-anti-bcl-2-Tyr(3)-octreotate.","['Balkin, Ethan R', 'Liu, Dijie', 'Jia, Fang', 'Ruthengael, Varyanna C', 'Shaffer, Suzanne M', 'Miller, William H', 'Lewis, Michael R']","['Balkin ER', 'Liu D', 'Jia F', 'Ruthengael VC', 'Shaffer SM', 'Miller WH', 'Lewis MR']","[""Area of Pathobiology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO; Research Service, Harry S.

However, these algorithms often produce classifiers with weaknesses in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces fuzzy support vector machine which is a learning algorithm based on combination of fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines for microarray classification. RESULTS: Experimental results on public leukemia, prostate, and colon cancer datasets show that fuzzy support vector machine applied in combination with filter or wrapper feature selection methods develops a robust model with higher accuracy than the conventional microarray classification models such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the interpretable rule-base inferred from fuzzy support vector machine helps extracting biological knowledge from microarray data. CONCLUSIONS: Fuzzy support vector machine as a new classification model with high generalization power, robustness, and good interpretability seems to be a promising tool for gene expression microarray classification.","['Hajiloo, Mohsen', 'Rabiee, Hamid R', 'Anooshahpour, Mahdi']","['Hajiloo M', 'Rabiee HR', 'Anooshahpour M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131001,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Decision Trees', '*Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Protein Array Analysis/*methods', 'Software', '*Support Vector Machine']",PMC3849760,2013/12/07 06:00,2014/05/29 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-14-S13-S4 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-14-S13-S4 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2013;14 Suppl 13:S4. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-14-S13-S4.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: pH-sensitive niosomal formulations bearing PEG-Poly (monomethyl itaconate)-CholC6 (PEG-PMMI-CholC6) copolymers and cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) were prepared by a modified ethanol injection method and characterized with regard to pH-responsiveness and stability in human serum. The ability of pH-sensitive niosomes to enhance the Sirolimus cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro using human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell line (K562) and compared with cytotoxicity effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This study showed that both formulations can be rendered pH-sensitive property and were found to rapidly release their contents under mildly acidic conditions. However, the CHEMS-based niosomes lost their pH-sensitivity after incubation in plasma, whereas, PEG-PMMI-CholC6 niosomes preserved their ability to respond to pH change. Sirolimus encapsulated in pH-sensitive niosomes exhibited a higher cytotoxicity than the control conventional formulation on K562 cell line. On the other hand, both pH-sensitive niosomes showed lower antiproliferative effect on HUVEC cells. CONCLUSION: Plasma stable, pH-sensitive PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based niosomes can improve the in vitro efficiency and also reduce the side effects of Sirolimus.","['Ghanbarzadeh, Saeed', 'Khorrami, Arash', 'Pourmoazzen, Zhaleh', 'Arami, Sanam']","['Ghanbarzadeh S', 'Khorrami A', 'Pourmoazzen Z', 'Arami S']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131125,England,Pharm Dev Technol,Pharmaceutical development and technology,9610932,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Succinates)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'Q4516562YH (itaconic acid)', 'T3J4KS4201 (cholesteryl succinate)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Cholesterol Esters/chemistry', 'Drug Stability', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'K562 Cells', 'Liposomes', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Sirolimus/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Succinates/chemistry', 'Surface-Active Agents/*chemistry']",,2013/11/26 06:00,2015/12/30 06:00,['2013/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10837450.2013.860553 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Dev Technol. 2015 May;20(3):279-87. doi: 10.3109/10837450.2013.860553.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical data of patients who developed BSIs from June 2009 to May 2010 in 2 hematologic wards at the Catholic BMT center. Ward A is a 44-bed unit mainly conducting conventional high dose chemotherapy and ward B is a 23-bed unit exclusively conducting BMT. RESULTS: Overall, 222 BSI episodes were developed from 159 patients. Acute myeloid leukemia in ward A and multiple myeloma in ward B were more frequent than in ward B and A, respectively. Sex, age, presence of neutropenia, shock, Pitt bacteremia score, type of central catheter, level of C-reactive protein, duration of admission days, type of BSI, overall mortality and distribution of organisms were not different between the 2 wards. There were 202 monomicrobial and 20 polymicrobial BSI episodes, including 2 fungemia episodes. The incidence rate of overall BSIs per 1,000 patient-days was higher in ward A than in ward B (incidence rate ratio 2.88, 95% confidence interval 1.97-4.22, P<0.001). Among 243 organisms isolated, the number of gram positives, gram negatives and fungi were 122, 119 and 2, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common organism in both ward A and B (27.6% and 42.4%), followed by viridians streptococci (18.6% and 15.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.3% and 9.0%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers accounted for 31.9% (23/72) of E. coli and 71.0% (22/31) of K. pneumoniae. Out of 19 Enterococcus faecium, 7 isolates (36.8%) were resistant to vancomycin. The crude mortality rates at 7 and 30 days after each BSI episode were 4.5% (10/222) and 13.1% (29/222), and were significantly higher in the patients with shock compared with those without shock (20.5% vs. 1.1%, P<0.001 and 38.5% vs. 7.7%, P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of BSIs was higher in patients receiving chemotherapy than those receiving BMT, but the distribution of organisms was not different between the 2 wards. E. coli was the most common causative BSI organism in hematologic wards followed by viridians streptococci and K. pneumoniae.","['Kwon, Jae-Cheol', 'Kim, Si-Hyun', 'Choi, Jae-Ki', 'Cho, Sung-Yeon', 'Park, Yeon-Joon', 'Park, Sun Hee', 'Choi, Su-Mi', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Choi, Jung-Hyun', 'Yoo, Jin-Hong']","['Kwon JC', 'Kim SH', 'Choi JK', 'Cho SY', 'Park YJ', 'Park SH', 'Choi SM', 'Lee DG', 'Choi JH', 'Yoo JH']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, National Health Insurance Corporation Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, Korea. ; Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130329,Korea (South),Infect Chemother,Infection & chemotherapy,101531537,,,,PMC3780938,2013/11/23 06:00,2013/11/23 06:01,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3947/ic.2013.45.1.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Chemother. 2013 Mar;45(1):51-61. doi: 10.3947/ic.2013.45.1.51.

We studied brain morphology and neurocognitive functions in adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood acute, low and standard risk lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which was successfully treated with chemotherapy. We expected that intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy administered in childhood will affect grey matter structures, including hippocampus and olfactory bulbs, areas where postnatal neurogenesis is ongoing. METHODS: We examined 27 ALL-survivors and 27 age-matched healthy controls, ages 15-22 years. ALL-survivors developed disease prior to their 11th birthday without central nervous system involvement, were treated with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy and received no radiation. Volumes of grey, white matter and olfactory bulbs were measured on T1 and T2 magnetic resonance images manually, using FIRST (FMRIB's integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Memory, executive functions, attention, intelligence and olfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Mean volumes of left hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and nucleus accumbens were smaller in the ALL group. VBM analysis revealed significantly smaller volumes of the left calcarine gyrus, both lingual gyri and the left precuneus. DTI data analysis provided no evidence for white matter pathology. Lower scores in hippocampus-dependent memory were measured in ALL-subjects, while lower figural memory correlated with smaller hippocampal volumes. INTERPRETATION: Findings demonstrate that childhood ALL, treated with chemotherapy, is associated with smaller grey matter volumes of neocortical and subcortical grey matter and lower hippocampal memory performance in adolescence and adulthood.","['Genschaft, Marina', 'Huebner, Thomas', 'Plessow, Franziska', 'Ikonomidou, Vasiliki N', 'Abolmaali, Nasreddin', 'Krone, Franziska', 'Hoffmann, Andre', 'Holfeld, Elisabeth', 'Vorwerk, Peter', 'Kramm, Christof', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Koustenis, Elisabeth', 'Hernaiz-Driever, Pablo', 'Mandal, Rakesh', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Hummel, Thomas', 'Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy', 'Kirschbaum, Clemens', 'Smolka, Michael N']","['Genschaft M', 'Huebner T', 'Plessow F', 'Ikonomidou VN', 'Abolmaali N', 'Krone F', 'Hoffmann A', 'Holfeld E', 'Vorwerk P', 'Kramm C', 'Gruhn B', 'Koustenis E', 'Hernaiz-Driever P', 'Mandal R', 'Suttorp M', 'Hummel T', 'Ikonomidou C', 'Kirschbaum C', 'Smolka MN']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131112,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain/*drug effects/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Diffusion Tensor Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory/drug effects', 'Neurogenesis/drug effects', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Smell/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC3827075,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/09/04 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0078599 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-15851 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 12;8(11):e78599. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078599. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both viruses induce chronic lymphoproliferative diseases with BLV affecting the B-cell lineage and HTLV-1 affecting the T-cell lineage. The pathologies of BLV- and HTLV-induced infections are notably similar, with an absence of chronic viraemia and a long latency period. These viruses encode at least two regulatory proteins, namely, Tax and Rex, in the pX region located between the env gene and the 3' long terminal repeat. The Tax protein is a key contributor to the oncogenic potential of the virus, and is also the key protein involved in viral replication. However, BLV infection is not sufficient for leukemogenesis, and additional events such as gene mutations must take place. In this review, we first summarize the similarities between the two viruses in terms of genomic organization, virology, and pathology. We then describe the current knowledge of the BLV model, which may also be relevant for the understanding of leukemogenesis caused by HTLV-1. In addition, we address our improved understanding of Tax functions through the newly identified BLV Tax mutants, which have a substitution between amino acids 240 and 265.","['Aida, Yoko', 'Murakami, Hironobu', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke']","['Aida Y', 'Murakami H', 'Takahashi M', 'Takeshima SN']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN Wako, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131108,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC3820957,2013/11/23 06:00,2013/11/23 06:01,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2013.00328 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2013 Nov 8;4:328. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00328. eCollection 2013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', 'BLV', 'EBL', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax', 'apoptosis', 'leukemogensis', 'transactivation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, longer duration of GC treatment for GVHD (OR, 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.20) and lower body mass index (BMI) SDS (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.95) were associated with decreased LBMD SDS.

Whole-genome and -exome sequencing has contributed to the characterization of the mutational spectrum of the disease, but the underlying transcriptional profile is still poorly understood. We have performed deep RNA sequencing in different subpopulations of normal B-lymphocytes and CLL cells from a cohort of 98 patients, and characterized the CLL transcriptional landscape with unprecedented resolution. We detected thousands of transcriptional elements differentially expressed between the CLL and normal B cells, including protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs, and pseudogenes. Transposable elements are globally derepressed in CLL cells. In addition, two thousand genes-most of which are not differentially expressed-exhibit CLL-specific splicing patterns. Genes involved in metabolic pathways showed higher expression in CLL, while genes related to spliceosome, proteasome, and ribosome were among the most down-regulated in CLL. Clustering of the CLL samples according to RNA-seq derived gene expression levels unveiled two robust molecular subgroups, C1 and C2. C1/C2 subgroups and the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) region were the only independent variables in predicting time to treatment in a multivariate analysis with main clinico-biological features. This subdivision was validated in an independent cohort of patients monitored through DNA microarrays. Further analysis shows that B-cell receptor (BCR) activation in the microenvironment of the lymph node may be at the origin of the C1/C2 differences.","['Ferreira, Pedro G', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Rico, Daniel', 'Gomez-Lopez, Gonzalo', 'Martinez-Trillos, Alejandra', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Ecker, Simone', 'Gonzalez-Perez, Abel', 'Knowles, David G', 'Monlong, Jean', 'Johnson, Rory', 'Quesada, Victor', 'Djebali, Sarah', 'Papasaikas, Panagiotis', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Royo, Cristina', 'Cazorla, Maite', 'Pinyol, Magda', 'Clot, Guillem', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Kulis, Marta', 'Tamborero, David', 'Gouin, Anais', 'Blanc, Julie', 'Gut, Marta', 'Gut, Ivo', 'Puente, Xose S', 'Pisano, David G', 'Martin-Subero, Jose Ignacio', 'Lopez-Bigas, Nuria', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Valencia, Alfonso', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos', 'Campo, Elias', 'Guigo, Roderic']","['Ferreira PG', 'Jares P', 'Rico D', 'Gomez-Lopez G', 'Martinez-Trillos A', 'Villamor N', 'Ecker S', 'Gonzalez-Perez A', 'Knowles DG', 'Monlong J', 'Johnson R', 'Quesada V', 'Djebali S', 'Papasaikas P', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Colomer D', 'Royo C', 'Cazorla M', 'Pinyol M', 'Clot G', 'Aymerich M', 'Rozman M', 'Kulis M', 'Tamborero D', 'Gouin A', 'Blanc J', 'Gut M', 'Gut I', 'Puente XS', 'Pisano DG', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Lopez-Bigas N', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Valencia A', 'Lopez-Otin C', 'Campo E', 'Guigo R']","['Bioinformatics and Genomics Programme, Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), 08003 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131121,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],IM,"['Aged', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Ribosomes/genetics', 'Spliceosomes/genetics']",PMC3912412,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.152132.112 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.152132.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2014 Feb;24(2):212-26. doi: 10.1101/gr.152132.112.

However, little is known about the pathogenicity of this bacterium. To characterize host response to this bacterium, we measured (via ELISA) the amount of TNF-alpha in the culture supernatant following the stimulation of THP-1 cells (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) with R. dentocariosa cells (ATCC14189 and ATCC14190). Exposure to bacterial cells induced the production of TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. The bacterial induction of TNF-alpha in THP-1 cells was mediated by the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), as demonstrated by gene-specific knockdown via siRNA, which successfully suppressed TLR2 expression and significantly inhibited the production of TNF-alpha in the culture supernatant. To confirm the role of TLR2, we examined TLR2-dependent NF-kappaB activation by R. dentocariosa cells in a distinct cell line. Specifically, HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with the human TLR2 gene and an NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase-encoding reporter gene. The bacterial cells induced NF-kappaB activation in the transfected HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, bacterial cells failed to induce NF-kappaB activation in cells transfected with pEF6 control vector. Taken together, these results suggest that R. dentocariosa induces host TNF-alpha production by a TLR2-dependent mechanism.","['Kataoka, Hideo', 'Taniguchi, Makoto', 'Fukamachi, Haruka', 'Arimoto, Takafumi', 'Morisaki, Hirobumi', 'Kuwata, Hirotaka']","['Kataoka H', 'Taniguchi M', 'Fukamachi H', 'Arimoto T', 'Morisaki H', 'Kuwata H']","['Departments of Oral Microbiology and Immunology, Showa University School of Dentistry, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131216,United States,Pathog Dis,Pathogens and disease,101595366,"['0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Micrococcaceae/*immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/immunology']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/2049-632X.12115 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathog Dis. 2014 Jun;71(1):65-8. doi: 10.1111/2049-632X.12115.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search of articles published between January 1966 and June 2013 was performed using PubMed with the following search terms: ponatinib, AP24534, and Iclusig. ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc, was contacted for unpublished information. Other sources included American Society of Hematology abstracts, the Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Web site, and clinicaltrials.gov. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Included articles and abstracts were published in English and contain information about ponatinib, particularly in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DATA SYNTHESIS: Following the phase II PACE trial, ponatinib was approved for the treatment of patients with chronic-phase (CP), accelerated-phase (AP), or blast-phase (BP) CML or Ph+ ALL who have become intolerant or resistant to previous therapy. Unlike other BCR-ABL TKIs, ponatinib was designed to overcome the T315I mutation. At 15.3 months, 46% of patients with CP-CML achieved a complete cytogenetic response, and 34% achieved a major molecular response. Complete hematologic responses occurred in 47% of patients with AP-CML, 21% with BP-CML, and 34% with Ph+ ALL after 1 year. Severe toxicities included myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and arterial thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib is a potent TKI that can overcome several resistance mechanisms in previously treated patients with CML and Ph+ ALL. Ponatinib should be reserved for patients who have failed first-line therapy, have the T315I mutation, or have progressed.","['Shamroe, Caitlin L', 'Comeau, Jill M']","['Shamroe CL', 'Comeau JM']","['Louisiana State University Health, Shreveport, LA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131121,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1060028013501144 [pii]', '10.1177/1060028013501144 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2013 Nov;47(11):1540-6. doi: 10.1177/1060028013501144.

PROCEDURE: In the ALL92 MT study we prospectively registered the intake of MTX/6MP. The registration was done when blood samples for erythrocyte MTX/6MP metabolite measurements were collected, and referred to the time of intake in the period since last registration. Nine thousand one hundred ninety-five registrations in total. The administration of MTX/6MP was scored as morning, midday, or evening. RESULTS: Of 532 patients, 296 took their medication consistently in the evening, 129 in the evening 50.0-99.9% of the time, and 101 in the evening <50% of the time, six did not have any registrations. The circadian schedule did not differ significantly by age, sex, MTX/6MP doses, and average absolute neutrophil counts. The circadian schedule groups did differ on risk groups (P = 0.003) with fewer HR patients in the 50-99.9% group, and there was a negative correlation between percentage of time on evening schedule and average WBC (Spearman's rho -0.15; P = 0.0004). Average WBC was not associated with relapse on ALL92. In a Cox multivariate model the circadian schedule of MTX/6MP was not of prognostic significance for the risk of relapse, and the 10-year cumulative relapse risk was below 20% in all groups. CONCLUSION: An evening schedule may still be recommended based on the previous publications, but in this study morning administration of MTX and 6MP does not seem to impact EFS.","['Clemmensen, Kim K B', 'Christensen, Regitse H', 'Shabaneh, Diana N', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Clemmensen KK', 'Christensen RH', 'Shabaneh DN', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Heyman M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Wesenberg F', 'Rosthoj S', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Clinic for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Juliane Marie Centre, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131122,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24867 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Apr;61(4):653-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24867.

Our aim is to identify age and stage related MDS/AML incidence post BC diagnosis. We used the 2001-2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database to identify first primary stage I-III BC patients. Subsequent MDS or AML diagnosis was identified with observed rates compared to expected MDS/AML incidence in the general population. Age adjusted observed/expected rate ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The unadjusted all age and stage MDS/AML incidence rate was .15 % (470/306,691) with a progressively higher rate by age (age 20-49 = .11, age 50-64 = .14, age 65+ =.21, and age 75+ =.18) and stage (stage I = .11, stage II = .18, and stage III = .22). Compared to the general population, BC patients had a 2.75-fold [95 % CI 2.51-3.00] increased relative risk of being diagnosed with MDS/AML. Young age survivors had highest relative risk [age 20-49: relative risk (RR) = 10.60 (95 % CI 8.57-12.93); age 50-64: 5.96 (95 % CI 5.13, 6.88); age 65-74 year-olds: 2.94 (95 % CI 2.45, 3.50); and age >/=75 year-olds: 1.28 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.56)]. Separately MDS relative risk was highest among young women [30.44 (95 % CI = 19.63, 44.62)]. MDS/AML relative risk increased from 1.87 to 5.66 for stage I-III. CONCLUSIONS: Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia relative risk is substantially elevated among breast cancer survivors especially those aged 20-49. While the actual number is small, MDS/AML is a serious disease. More research is needed to identify the treatments that put women at risk and find less leukemogenic options, especially for young women.","['Kaplan, Henry G', 'Malmgren, Judith A', 'Li, Christopher I', 'Calip, Gregory S']","['Kaplan HG', 'Malmgren JA', 'Li CI', 'Calip GS']","['Swedish Cancer Institute, 1221 E.

Several MAPK cascades are known with the MEK1/2-ERK1/2, JNK, and p38MAPKs receiving most attention, but the role of MEK5-ERK5 in intracellular signaling deserves more scrutiny, as this pathway transmits signals that can complement ERK/2 signaling. We hypothesized that the ERK5 pathway plays a role in the control of monocytic differentiation, which is disturbed in myeloid leukemia. We therefore examined the cellular phenotype and key molecular events which occur when human myeloid leukemia cells, acute (AML) or chronic (CML), are forced to differentiate by vitamin D derivatives (VDDs). This study was performed using established cell lines HL60 and U937, and primary cultures of blasts from 10 patients with ML. We found that ERK5 and its direct downstream target transcription factor MEF2C are upregulated by 1,25D in parallel with monocytic differentiation. Further, inhibition of ERK5 activity by specific pharmacological agents BIX02189 and XMD8-92 alters the phenotype of these cells by reducing the abundance of the VDD-induced surface monocytic marker CD14, and concomitantly increasing surface expression of the general myeloid marker CD11b.

Tyrosine177 of BCR is a Grb2 binding site required for BCR/ABL-induced CML in mice. In the current study, we use a mouse bone marrow transduction/transplantation system to demonstrate that addition of oncogenic NRAS (NRASG12D) to a vector containing a BCR/ABL(Y177F) mutant ""rescues"" the CML phenotype rapidly and efficiently. To further narrow down the pathways downstream of RAS that are responsible for this rescue effect, we utilize well-characterized RAS effector loop mutants and determine that the RAL pathway is important for rapid induction of CML. Inhibition of this pathway by a dominant negative RAL is capable of delaying disease progression. Results from the present study support the notion of RAL inhibition as a potential therapy for BCR/ABL-induced CML.","['Fredericks, Jessica', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Fredericks J', 'Ren R']","['State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131121,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (ral Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ral GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae', 'ral GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'ral Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-013-0304-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2013 Dec;7(4):452-61. doi: 10.1007/s11684-013-0304-0.

STAT5 can be phosphorylated at three positions, on a tyrosine and on the two serines S725 and S779. We have investigated the importance of STAT5 serine phosphorylation for BCR-ABL-induced leukemogenesis. In cultured bone marrow cells, expression of a STAT5 mutant lacking the S725 and S779 phosphorylation sites (STAT5(SASA)) prohibits transformation and induces apoptosis. Accordingly, STAT5(SASA) BCR-ABL(+) cells display a strongly reduced leukemic potential in vivo, predominantly caused by loss of S779 phosphorylation that prevents the nuclear translocation of STAT5. Three distinct lines of evidence indicate that S779 is phosphorylated by group I p21-activated kinase (PAK). We show further that PAK-dependent serine phosphorylation of STAT5 is unaffected by BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Interfering with STAT5 phosphorylation could thus be a novel therapeutic approach to target BCR-ABL-induced malignancies.","['Berger, A', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic, A', 'Bourgeais, J', 'Hoefling, L', 'Warsch, W', 'Grundschober, E', 'Uras, I Z', 'Menzl, I', 'Putz, E M', 'Hoermann, G', 'Schuster, C', 'Fajmann, S', 'Leitner, E', 'Kubicek, S', 'Moriggl, R', 'Gouilleux, F', 'Sexl, V']","['Berger A', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic A', 'Bourgeais J', 'Hoefling L', 'Warsch W', 'Grundschober E', 'Uras IZ', 'Menzl I', 'Putz EM', 'Hoermann G', 'Schuster C', 'Fajmann S', 'Leitner E', 'Kubicek S', 'Moriggl R', 'Gouilleux F', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'GICC CNRS UMR 7292, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Office of Technology Transfer T010, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research (LBI-CR), Vienna, Austria.', 'GICC CNRS UMR 7292, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131122,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Leukemia/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphorylation', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'p21-Activated Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC3948164,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013351 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.351 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Mar;28(3):629-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.351.

A review.,339-45,10.5507/bp.2013.084 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of premalignant hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias and increased risk of progression to acute leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis still plays a central role in the diagnosis of MDS, as clonal chromosomal abnormalities are observed in 30-50% of MDS patients. Despite their technical limitations, standard karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are routinely used for identifying recurrent chromosomal rearrangements. However, using this approach means that submicroscopic and not targeted chromosomal aberrations, as well as somatic mutations and epigenetic changes remain largely undetected. METHODS AND RESULTS: Introduction of methods for the analysis of copy-number variations (CNV), including array-based technologies and Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) has provided novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of MDS and considerably extended possibilities for genetic laboratory testing. Several novel molecular markers have been discovered and used for diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of patients with MDS. At present, mutational analysis is not routinely performed, as the clinical significance of somatic mutations in MDS has only begun to emerge. However, recently introduced Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies could help to elucidate the relationship between chromosomal and molecular aberrations in MDS and lead to further improvement in its diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This review focuses on the advantages, limitations, clinical applications and future perspectives of three molecular methods (array-based analysis, MLPA and NGS) currently used in genetic testing and/ or translational research of MDS. In conclusion, a brief summary for clinicians from the routine diagnostic point of view is given.","['Lukackova, Renata', 'Gerykova Bujalkova, Maria', 'Majerova, Lubica', 'Mladosievicova, Beata']","['Lukackova R', 'Gerykova Bujalkova M', 'Majerova L', 'Mladosievicova B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Medirex a.s., Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131120,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*Cytological Techniques', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2016/09/23 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2013.084 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2014 Sep;158(3):339-45. doi: 10.5507/bp.2013.084.

These small RNAs exert their function assembled in the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), where members of Argonaute (Ago) family of proteins provide a unique platform for target recognition and gene silencing. Here, by using myeloid cell lines and primary blasts, we show that Ago2 has a key role in human monocytic cell fate determination and in LPS-induced inflammatory response of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3)-treated myeloid cells. The silencing of Ago2 impairs the D3-dependent miR-17-5p/20a/106a, miR-125b and miR-155 downregulation, the accumulation of their translational targets AML1, VDR and C/EBPbeta and monocytic cell differentiation. Moreover, we show that Ago2 is recruited on miR-155 host gene promoter and on the upstream region of an overlapping antisense lncRNA, determining their epigenetic silencing, and miR-155 downregulation.

Neutrophils express a large number of cell surface receptors for the recognition of pathogen invasion and the inflammatory environment. Those include G-protein-coupled chemokine and chemoattractant receptors, Fc-receptors, adhesion receptors such as selectins/selectin ligands and integrins, various cytokine receptors, as well as innate immune receptors such as Toll-like receptors and C-type lectins. The various cell surface receptors trigger very diverse signal transduction pathways including activation of heterotrimeric and monomeric G-proteins, receptor-induced and store-operated Ca(2+) signals, protein and lipid kinases, adapter proteins and cytoskeletal rearrangement.

This knowledge is crucial for understanding how neutrophils participate in antimicrobial host defense and inflammatory tissue damage and may also point to possible future targets of the pharmacological therapy of neutrophil-mediated autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.","['Futosi, Krisztina', 'Fodor, Szabina', 'Mocsai, Attila']","['Futosi K', 'Fodor S', 'Mocsai A']","['Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20131118,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Selectins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Selectins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(13)00418-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2013.11.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2013 Dec;17(4):1185-97. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2013.11.010.

In order to explore the molecular mechanism of ATO in leukemia cells with time series, we adopted bioinformatics strategy to analyze expression changing patterns and changes in transcription regulation modules of time series genes filtered from Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE24946). We totally screened out 1847 time series genes for subsequent analysis. The KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathways enrichment analysis of these genes showed that oxidative phosphorylation and ribosome were the top 2 significantly enriched pathways. STEM software was employed to compare changing patterns of gene expression with assigned 50 expression patterns. We screened out 7 significantly enriched patterns and 4 tendency charts of time series genes. The result of Gene Ontology showed that functions of times series genes mainly distributed in profiles 41, 40, 39 and 38. Seven genes with positive regulation of cell adhesion function were enriched in profile 40, and presented the same first increased model then decreased model as profile 40. The transcription module analysis showed that they mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation pathway and ribosome pathway. Overall, our data summarized the gene expression changes in ATO treated K562-r cell lines with time and suggested that time series genes mainly regulated cell adhesive. Furthermore, our result may provide theoretical basis of molecular biology in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Yang, Hong', 'Lin, Shan', 'Cui, Jingru']","['Yang H', 'Lin S', 'Cui J']","['Department of Pharmacy, 4th Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, 4th Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, 4th Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.

As p53 needs to be inactivated in order for tumor cells to survive and thrive, pediatric tumors typically make use of other mechanisms to keep p53 in check. One of the critical negative regulators of p53 is the MDM2 oncoprotein. Many anticancer drug development efforts in the past decade have therefore been devoted to the discovery and optimization of small molecules that selectively disrupt the interaction between MDM2 and p53, which could provide, in principle, a potent means to restore p53 function in tumor cells with wild-type p53. The nutlins are the class of selective inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction that are currently most advanced in their clinical development. We review here the preclinical data that support the potential therapeutic use of nutlin drugs in the treatment of various pediatric tumors, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, medulloblastoma, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Van Maerken, Tom', 'Rihani, Ali', 'Van Goethem, Alan', 'De Paepe, Anne', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Vandesompele, Jo']","['Van Maerken T', 'Rihani A', 'Van Goethem A', 'De Paepe A', 'Speleman F', 'Vandesompele J']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of thiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidines using recyclable KF/alumina catalyst. The reaction of 4,6-dichloro-5-aminopyrimidine with isothiocyanates in presence of 20 mol% KF/alumina produced thiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidines in excellent yields without any chromatographic purifications. The method is operationally simple, fast and the catalyst can be reused without any significant loss of activity. These compounds were tested for antiproliferative activity in a panel of 8 cancer cell lines, including lung (NCI-H322 and A549), epidermal (A431), glioblastoma (T98G), pancreatic (MIAPaCa-2), prostate (PC-3), human leukemia (HL-60) and breast (T47D) cells.

The morpholine substituted analog 4a displayed activity in HL-60 cells with IC50 value of 8 muM. The compound 4k showed induction of apoptosis in A549 cells at 10 muM, as indicated by the increase in the sub-G1 population. The nuclear morphology of A549 cells after treatment with 4k was also investigated. Similarly, the morpholine substituted analog 4a induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells at 20 muM. The effect of compound 4a on mitochondrial potential loss in HL-60 cells was also studied. Further, western blotting of 4a and 4k showed cleavage of PARP-1 and procaspase-3 inhibition which confirms their apoptosis-inducing activity.","['Singh, Baljinder', 'Guru, Santosh K', 'Kour, Smit', 'Jain, Shreyans K', 'Sharma, Rajni', 'Sharma, Parduman R', 'Singh, Shashank K', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Bharate, Sandip B', 'Vishwakarma, Ram A']","['Singh B', 'Guru SK', 'Kour S', 'Jain SK', 'Sharma R', 'Sharma PR', 'Singh SK', 'Bhushan S', 'Bharate SB', 'Vishwakarma RA']","['Natural Products Chemistry Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR), Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Anusandhan Bhawan, 2 Rafi Marg, New Delhi 110001, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131022,France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '25408-35-9 (thiazolo(3,2-a)perimidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0223-5234(13)00680-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.10.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2013;70:864-74. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.10.039.

Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), the major oncoprotein of the virus, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and trigger survivin expression in malignant cell lines. LMP1 expression has been detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but its properties have not been studied in patients with low-grade B-cell lymphomas. Recent data show that LMP1 can simultaneously induce and inhibit apoptosis in B cells. We detected LMP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in patients with leukemic low-grade B-cell lymphoma and correlated the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule survivin to that of LMP1 in this group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral whole blood from 64 patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma was tested by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the BXLF-1 gene of EBV, and positive samples were tested by conventional PCR for LMP1 expression. Accordingly, survivin mRNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in all samples and compared between LMP1-positive (LMP1(+)) and LMP1(-) patients. RESULTS: The BXLF-1 gene was detected in 27 of 64 patients (42%). LMP1 was expressed in 22 of 27 (81%) EBV(+) patients. Survivin expression was found to be 6.36 times higher in LMP1(-) patients than in LMP1(+) patients (P = .008). CONCLUSION: Our results imply that in patients with non-EBV-related leukemic low-grade B-cell lymphoma, LMP1 expression is possibly correlated to apoptosis, as indicated by the lower survivin mRNA levels in LMP1(+) patients.","['Diamantopoulos, Panagiotis T', 'Polonyfi, Katerina', 'Sofotasiou, Maria', 'Mantzourani, Marina', 'Galanopoulos, Athanassios', 'Spanakis, Nikolaos', 'Papadopoulou, Vasiliki', 'Kalala, Fani', 'Iliakis, Theodoros', 'Zareifi, Danai-Stella', 'Kodandreopoulou, Elina', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros', 'Angelopoulou, Maria', 'Siakantaris, Marina', 'Terpos, Evangelos', 'Variami, Eleni', 'Kollia, Panagoula', 'Vaiopoulos, George', 'Pangalis, Gerassimos', 'Viniou, Nora-Athina']","['Diamantopoulos PT', 'Polonyfi K', 'Sofotasiou M', 'Mantzourani M', 'Galanopoulos A', 'Spanakis N', 'Papadopoulou V', 'Kalala F', 'Iliakis T', 'Zareifi DS', 'Kodandreopoulou E', 'Vassilakopoulos T', 'Angelopoulou M', 'Siakantaris M', 'Terpos E', 'Variami E', 'Kollia P', 'Vaiopoulos G', 'Pangalis G', 'Viniou NA']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.

Taken together, our results suggest that the search for BCR-ABL1 mutations should be initiated if patients have not achieved MMR following 12 months of TKI treatment.","['Itonaga, Hidehiro', 'Tsushima, Hideki', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Doi, Yuko', 'Mori, Sayaka', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Matsuo, Emi', 'Nakashima, Jun', 'Kato, Takeharu', 'Horai, Makiko', 'Taguchi, Masataka', 'Matsuo, Masatoshi', 'Taniguchi, Hiroaki', 'Makiyama, Junnya', 'Sato, Shinya', 'Horio, Kensuke', 'Ando, Koji', 'Moriwaki, Yuji', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Ogawa, Daisuke', 'Yamasaki, Reishi', 'Takasaki, Yumi', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Kawaguchi, Yasuhisa', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Joh, Tatsuro', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Nonaka, Hiroaki', 'Soda, Hisashi', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Nagai, Kazuhiro', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Itonaga H', 'Tsushima H', 'Imanishi D', 'Hata T', 'Doi Y', 'Mori S', 'Sasaki D', 'Hasegawa H', 'Matsuo E', 'Nakashima J', 'Kato T', 'Horai M', 'Taguchi M', 'Matsuo M', 'Taniguchi H', 'Makiyama J', 'Sato S', 'Horio K', 'Ando K', 'Moriwaki Y', 'Sawayama Y', 'Ogawa D', 'Yamasaki R', 'Takasaki Y', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Taguchi J', 'Kawaguchi Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Joh T', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Nonaka H', 'Soda H', 'Fukushima T', 'Nagai K', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Yanagihara K', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki City, Nagasaki, Japan; Nagasaki CML Study Group, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Nagasaki CML Study Group, Nagasaki, Japan.

However, advances in cancer diagnostics, therapy, and supportive care have saved numerous lives and many former cancer patients are now living for 5, 10, 20, and more years beyond their initial diagnosis. The majority of these patients have received radiotherapy as a part of their treatment regimen and are now beginning to develop secondary cancers arising from normal tissue exposure to damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Because historically patients rarely survived past the extended latency periods inherent to these RI cancers, very little effort was channeled towards the research leading to the development of therapeutic agents intended to prevent or ameliorate oncogenic effects of normal tissue exposure to radiation. The number of RI cancers is expected to increase very rapidly in the near future, but the field of cancer biology might not be prepared to address important issues related to this phenomena. One such issue is the ability to accurately differentiate between primary tumors and de novo arising secondary tumors in the same patient. Another issue is the lack of therapeutic agents intended to reduce such cancers in the future. To address these issues, large-scale epidemiological studies must be supplemented with appropriate animal modeling studies. This work reviews relevant mouse (Mus musculus) models of inbred and F1 animals and methodologies of induction of most relevant radiation-associated cancers: leukemia, lymphoma, and lung and breast cancers. Where available, underlying molecular pathologies are included.","['Rivina, Leena', 'Schiestl, Robert']","['Rivina L', 'Schiestl R']","['Department of Urology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.

METHODS: The significance of blast cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at diagnosis was evaluated in 81 adults newly diagnosed with ALL. Patients with unequivocal morphologic evidence of lymphoblasts in the cytocentrifuged CSF slide were considered to have CNS involvement regardless of the leukocyte count. The outcomes of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Four of the 81 patients (5%) had detectable blast cells, and three of these four patients had less than five leukocytes/muL of CSF. One-year event-free survival (EFS) was 25.0% and 53.2% (P = 0.008) and overall survival (OS) was 50.0% and 68.8% (P = 0.001) in patients with and without CNS involvement, respectively. CNS involvement had prognostic impact on EFS (P = 0.047) and OS (P = 0.009) after adjusting for sex, age, leukocyte count, Philadelphia chromosome status, and immunophenotype. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that morphologic detection of blast cells in the CSF at diagnosis of adult ALL, regardless of the leukocyte count, is associated with adverse prognosis.","['Ko, S-Y', 'Chi, H-S', 'Jang, S', 'Park, C-J']","['Ko SY', 'Chi HS', 'Jang S', 'Park CJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131122,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12166 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2014 Aug;36(4):451-8. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12166.

In order to evaluate the structural and functional role of selected residues in ASNases we report the screening of a library of L-ASNase mutants aiming to find detrimental mutations that significantly affect catalysis and substrate specificity. The library of mutants was created using the staggered extension process (StEp) and the genes of L- ASNases from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ErL-ASNase) and Erwinia carotovora (EcaL-ASNase). A mutant that displayed dramatic reduction in L-asparaginase activity and undetectable activity towards L-Gln and N(alpha) - acetyl-L-Asn was isolated and characterized. Sequence of the mutant showed that it has a single point aminoacid replacement (Gly281Ser) of the E. carotovora enzyme. Steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrated that the Gly281Ser aminoacid replacement influence significantly the enzyme's structural and functional properties. In particular it displays 10.8-fold increase in Km and 45.5-fold lower catalytic activity towards L-Asn. Analysis of the pH dependence of Vmax and Vmax/Km of L-Asn hydrolysis showed that the mutant displays modified properties regarding the dependence of kinetic constants towards the pH. Studies on the thermal stability of the mutant enzyme demonstrated that it exhibits about 3.8 degrees C higher halfinactivation temperature, compared to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that Gly281 contributes to the low stability of the enzyme. Biocomputing analysis suggested that the Gly281Ser replacement causes indirectly changes in the active site architecture and presumably alters the dynamics of the enzyme.","['Kotzia, Georgia A', 'Labrou, Nikolaos E']","['Kotzia GA', 'Labrou NE']","['Laboratory of Enzyme Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens, Iera Odos 75, 11855 - Athens, Greece.

The current study focuses on revealing the mechanisms by which API-1 induces apoptosis. RESULTS: API-1 rapidly and potently reduced the levels of Mcl-1 primarily in API-1-senstive lung cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 protected cells from induction of apoptosis by API-1. API-1 treatment decreased the half-life of Mcl-1, whereas inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 rescued Mcl-1 reduction induced by API-1. API-1 decreased Mcl-1 levels accompanied with a rapid increase in Mcl-1 phosphorylation (S159/T163). Moreover, inhibition of GSK3 inhibited Mcl-1 phosphorylation and reduction induced by API-1 and antagonized the effect of API-1 on induction of apoptosis. Knockdown of either FBXW7 or beta-TrCP alone, both of which are E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in Mcl-1 degradation, only partially rescued Mcl-1 reduction induced by API-1. However, double knockdown of both E3 ubiquitin ligases enhanced the rescue of API-1-induced Mcl-1 reduction. CONCLUSIONS: API-1 induces GSK3-dependent, beta-TrCP- and FBXW7-mediated Mcl-1 degradation, resulting in induction of apoptosis.","['Ren, Hui', 'Koo, Junghui', 'Guan, Baoxiang', 'Yue, Ping', 'Deng, Xingming', 'Chen, Mingwei', 'Khuri, Fadlo R', 'Sun, Shi-Yong']","['Ren H', 'Koo J', 'Guan B', 'Yue P', 'Deng X', 'Chen M', 'Khuri FR', 'Sun SY']","[""Department of Respiration, First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, P R China. chenmingwei@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131122,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MK 2206)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NSC 177223)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'F-Box Proteins/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3924345,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/07/18 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-146 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-146 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 Nov 22;12:146. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-146.,,,,,"['R01 CA118450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MTRR A66G (rs1801394) polymorphism is found to be associated with decreased enzyme affinity for MTR, the gene that encodes MS, and has been widely investigated for cancer risk, including leukemia. However, the conclusions of epidemiological studies have always been contradictory. To further clarify the association of MTRR A66G polymorphism with the risk of leukemia, this meta-analysis was performed for 2913 cases and 4764 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. Pooled ORs were determined for the co-dominant model (GG vs. AA, AG vs. AA), dominant model (GG + AG vs. AA) and recessive model (GG vs. AA+ AG), respectively. No significant associations were found for all comparisons in the overall pooled analysis. However, the results of stratified analyses revealed that MTRR A66G GG genotype was associated with decreased leukemia risk in the Caucasian population, in children and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In contrast, increased risk was observed in the Asian population and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This meta-analysis suggests that MTRR A66G GG is associated with decreased risk of leukemia in a Caucasian population and in children, especially for ALL.","['Fang, Dai-Hua', 'Ji, Qiang', 'Fan, Cong-Hai', 'An, Qi', 'Li, Juan']","['Fang DH', 'Ji Q', 'Fan CH', 'An Q', 'Li J']","[""Central Laboratory, Xuzhou Children's Hospital , Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20140124,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['EC 1.18.1.- (methionine synthase reductase)', 'EC 1.18.1.2 (Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Publication Bias', 'Risk']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.867492 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Aug;55(8):1910-4. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.867492.

These are among the most common hematologic malignancies and many patients with B-cell malignancies are incurable. Although most patients initially respond to first-line treatment, relapse is frequent and is associated with a poor prognosis. T cells that are genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) recognizing the B-cell-associated molecule CD19 have emerged as a potentially potent and exciting therapeutic modality in recent years. AREAS COVERED: This review explores the current peer-reviewed publications in the field and a discussion of expert opinion. EXPERT OPINION: Genetic engineering of T cells has become clinically feasible and appears to be safe. Here we provide an insight into the process of patient selection, engineered T-cell production, infusion procedure, expected toxicities and efficacy of this exciting approach as it is practiced in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Anti-CD19-redirected T cells likely represent the vanguard of an exciting new approach to treating cancer.","['Gill, Saar', 'Porter, David L']","['Gill S', 'Porter DL']","['University of Pennsylvania, Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine , Philadelphia, PA 19106 , USA david.porter@uphs.upenn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131121,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/*methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2014.860442 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2014 Jan;14(1):37-49. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2014.860442.

METHODS: We examined schistocytes count on blood films from 35 DIC patients and checked morphological anomalies of all RBCs. RESULTS: Thirty of 35 patients presented with schistocytes and 22 with acanthocytes, which was the commonest shape anomaly. Mean percentage +/- standard deviation was 0.33 +/- 0.38%, median value was 0.1%, and range was 0-1.4%. The patients with schistocytes >/= 1% had circumstances frequently associated with increased schistocytes count (promyelocytic leukaemia, pregnancy, severe infection). DISCUSSION: Schistocytes were thus frequently observed in DIC patients, usually with low percentage, within or close to the reference range (<0.5%). Schistocytes measurement is not a clue test for the initial diagnosis of DIC, but might be of clinical value to suggest an associated or underlying thrombotic microangiopathy if >/= 1%.","['Lesesve, J-F', 'Martin, M', 'Banasiak, C', 'Andre-Kerneis, E', 'Bardet, V', 'Lusina, D', 'Kharbach, A', 'Genevieve, F', 'Lecompte, T']","['Lesesve JF', 'Martin M', 'Banasiak C', 'Andre-Kerneis E', 'Bardet V', 'Lusina D', 'Kharbach A', 'Genevieve F', 'Lecompte T']","['Hematology laboratories at Nancy, Nancy, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131122,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Shape', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications/*pathology', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Shock, Septic/complications/*pathology', 'Thrombotic Microangiopathies/complications/*pathology']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12168 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2014 Aug;36(4):439-43. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12168.

BACKGROUND DATA: OM is a very common, potentially severe side effect, caused by treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer. METHODS: Forty patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who received high doses of methotrexate, were distributed into two groups. Group A (Preventive Group) was composed of patients who received preventive laser (red-subgroup A1 or infrared-subgroup A2) for 5 days, beginning on the 1st day of infusion. Group B (Treatment Group) was composed of patients who received laser treatment only if they developed post-chemotherapy mucositis (red-subgroup B1 or infrared-subgroup B2). Laser was used at wavelengths of 660 or 830 nm with output 100 mW, power density 3.57 W/cm(2), spot size 0.028 cm(2), energy of 1 J, resulting in an energy density of 35 J/cm(2) for 10 sec in the prophylactic group, and energy of 2 J, resulting in energy density of 70 J/cm(2) for 20 sec in the therapeutic group. RESULTS: The percentage of patients who did not develop OM was higher in Group A (60% vs. 25%). In Group B, 3/20 patients developed grade IV OM (15%), and a significant difference was found between the two subgroups at the end of treatment (p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic laser produced a better outcome than when patients did not receive any preventive intervention, and red laser (660 nm) was better than infrared (830 nm) in the prevention and treatment of OM.","['de Castro, Jurema Freire Lisboa', 'Abreu, Elizabeth Galamba Fernandes', 'Correia, Andreza Veruska Lira', 'da Mota Vasconcelos Brasil, Catarina', 'da Cruz Perez, Danyel Elias', 'de Paula Ramos Pedrosa, Francisco']","['de Castro JF', 'Abreu EG', 'Correia AV', 'da Mota Vasconcelos Brasil C', 'da Cruz Perez DE', 'de Paula Ramos Pedrosa F']","['1 Postgraduate Program in Dentistry, Oral Pathology Unit, Federal University of Pernambuco , Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131121,United States,Photomed Laser Surg,Photomedicine and laser surgery,101222340,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Low-Level Light Therapy', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Stomatitis/*prevention & control/*radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/11/23 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2013/11/23 06:00'],"['2013/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/pho.2012.3327 [doi]'],ppublish,Photomed Laser Surg. 2013 Dec;31(12):613-8. doi: 10.1089/pho.2012.3327.

The benzyl vanillin (2-(benzyloxy)-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) compound shows anti-proliferative activity in HL60 leukemia cancer cells and can effect cell cycle progression at G2/M phase. Its apoptosis activity was due to disruption of mitochondrial functioning. In this study, we have studied a series of compounds consisting of benzyl vanillin and benzimidazole structures. We hypothesize that by fusing these two structures we can produce compounds that have better anticancer activity with improved specificity particularly towards the leukemia cell line. Here we explored the anticancer activity of three compounds namely 2-(2-benzyloxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazole, 2MP, N-1-(2-benzyloxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-2-(2-benzyloxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazol e, 2XP, and (R) and (S)-1-(2-benzyloxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2, 2, 2-trichloroethyl benzenesulfonate, 3BS and compared their activity to 2-benzyloxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, (Bn1), the parent compound. 2XP and 3BS induces cell death of U937 leukemic cell line through DNA fragmentation that lead to the intrinsic caspase 9 activation. DNA binding study primarily by the equilibrium binding titration assay followed by the Viscosity study reveal the DNA binding through groove region with intrinsic binding constant 7.39 microM/bp and 6.86 microM/bp for 3BS and 2XP respectively. 2XP and 3BS showed strong DNA binding activity by the UV titration method with the computational drug modeling showed that both 2XP and 3BS failed to form any electrostatic linkages except via hydrophobic interaction through the minor groove region of the nucleic acid. The benzylvanillin alone (Bn1) has weak anticancer activity even after it was combined with the benzimidazole (2MP), but after addition of another benzylvanillin structure (2XP), stronger activity was observed. Also, the combination of benzylvanillin with benzenesulfonate (3BS) significantly improved the anticancer activity of Bn1. The present study provides a new insight of benzyl vanillin derivatives as potential anti-leukemic agent.","['Al-Mudaris, Zena A', 'Majid, Aman S A', 'Ji, Dan', 'Al-Mudarris, Ban A', 'Chen, Shih-Hsun', 'Liang, Po-Huang', 'Osman, Hasnah', 'Jamal Din, Shah Kamal Khan', 'Abdul Majid, Amin M S']","['Al-Mudaris ZA', 'Majid AS', 'Ji D', 'Al-Mudarris BA', 'Chen SH', 'Liang PH', 'Osman H', 'Jamal Din SK', 'Abdul Majid AM']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University Sains Malaysia, Minden, Penang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131115,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzaldehydes)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5KNC2TSW9G (benzylvanillin)', '685928Z18A (benzenesulfonic acid)', 'E24GX49LD8 (benzimidazole)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzaldehydes/*chemistry', 'Benzenesulfonates/*chemistry', 'Benzimidazoles/*chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Caspase 9', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Drug Design', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship']",PMC3829952,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0080983 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-21475 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 15;8(11):e80983. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080983. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported cloning MCL-1ES and characterizing it as an apoptotic molecule. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which MCL-1ES promotes cell death. MCL-1ES was distinct from other proapoptotic BCL-2 members that induce apoptosis by promoting BAX or BAK oligomerization, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), in that MCL-1ES promoted mitochondrial apoptosis independently of both BAX and BAK. Instead, MCL-1L was crucial for the apoptotic activity of MCL-1ES by facilitating its proper localization to the mitochondria. MCL-1ES did not interact with any BCL-2 family proteins except for MCL-1L, and antiapoptotic BCL-2 members failed to inhibit apoptosis induced by MCL-1ES. The BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain of MCL-1ES was critical for both MCL-1ES association with MCL-1L and apoptotic activity. MCL-1ES formed mitochondrial oligomers, and this process was followed by MOMP and cytochrome c release in a MCL-1L-dependent manner. These findings indicate that MCL-1ES, as a distinct proapoptotic BCL-2 family protein, may be useful for intervening in diseases that involve uncontrolled MCL-1L.","['Kim, Jae-Hong', 'Bae, Jeehyeon']","['Kim JH', 'Bae J']","['College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3832543,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/07/12 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0079626 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-27768 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 18;8(11):e79626. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0079626. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide evidence that in BCR-ABL expressing cells, treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) results in upregulation of mRNA levels and protein expression of sestrin3 (SESN3), a unique cellular inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Such upregulation appears to be mediated by regulatory effects on mTOR, as catalytic inhibition of the mTOR kinase also induces SESN3. Catalytic mTOR inhibition also results in upregulation of SESN3 expression in cells harboring the TKI-insensitive T315I-BCR-ABL mutant, which is resistant to imatinib mesylate. Overexpression of SESN3 results in inhibitory effects on different Ph+ leukemic cell lines including KT-1-derived leukemic precursors, indicating that SESN3 mediates anti-leukemic responses in Ph+ cells. Altogether, our findings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism for the generation of antileukemic responses in CML cells, involving upregulation of SESN3 expression.","['Vakana, Eliza', 'Arslan, Ahmet Dirim', 'Szilard, Amy', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Vakana E', 'Arslan AD', 'Szilard A', 'Altman JK', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

METHODS: Between July 2002 and June 2010, we retrospectively enrolled all consecutive patients admitted to our department with a diagnosis of portal cavernoma without abdominal malignancy or liver cirrhosis. The primary endpoint of this observational study was death and cause of death. Independent predictors of survival were identified using the Cox regression model. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were enrolled in the study. During a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 2.41 mo, 7 patients died. Causes of death were pulmonary embolism (n = 1), acute leukemia (n = 1), massive esophageal variceal hemorrhage (n = 1), progressive liver failure (n = 2), severe systemic infection secondary to multiple liver abscesses (n = 1) and accident (n = 1). The cumulative 6-, 12- and 36-mo survival rates were 94.9%, 86% and 86%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of ascites (HR = 10.729, 95%CI: 1.209-95.183, P = 0.033) and elevated white blood cell count (HR = 1.072, 95%CI: 1.014-1.133, P = 0.015) were independent prognostic factors of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with portal cavernoma.

CASE SUMMARY: A 36-year-old male with acute myelomonocytic leukemia and subsequent myelodysplastic syndrome underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. His course was complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease involving his skin and gastrointestinal tract. Five weeks after transplantation, he developed fever and confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of limbic encephalitis and cerebrospinal fluid tested positive for BK virus. Therapy with intravenous cidofovir was thought to be indicated. Although probenecid is commonly used to minimize the toxicities of cidofovir, the patient's severe graft-versus-host disease raised concerns about absorption of oral medications. Based on animal models and pharmacokinetic data, intravenous cimetidine was used in place of oral probenecid. Despite these therapies, the patient's mental status did not improve. He developed progressive organ system failure, and care was ultimately withdrawn. DISCUSSION: BK virus is increasingly described as a cause of encephalitis. The majority of reported cases have occurred in immunocompromised patients and have generally had a poor outcome. This case describes attempted antiviral therapy using cidofovir, the antiviral agent used most frequently in other syndromes due to BK virus. Intravenous cimetidine is a novel modality used to minimize ocular and renal toxicities frequently seen with cidofovir, and we believe this warrants further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: BK virus may be a cause of encephalitis in immunocompromised hosts, and cidofovir represents a possible treatment option.

CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old African American male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma was admitted for tumor lysis syndrome and renal failure. He was treated with 2 doses of rasburicase, subsequently developed methemoglobinemia, and required intubation, multiple packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, and 2 doses of methylene blue. A screen for glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was negative. His course was complicated by hemolytic anemia, nosocomial pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and septic shock. His methemoglobin concentrations normalized over several days; however, the patient eventually died on hospital day 16. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable. DISCUSSION: Our case was similar to previously published cases, except that our patient died and his G6PD screen was negative. Although it was negative, it is likely that this was a false negative result because this blood was drawn shortly after PRBC transfusions and during active hemolysis. Both these are likely to cause false-negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Methemoglobinemia is a rare adverse effect associated with the use of rasburicase and occurs most often in patients with G6PD deficiency. G6PD testing should not be ordered during active hemolysis or after blood transfusion because this may lead to false-negative results. Methylene blue should not be used as an antidote because it may worsen hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency.","['Bucklin, Mason H', 'Groth, Christine M']","['Bucklin MH', 'Groth CM']","['University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20131021,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Gout Suppressants)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Fatal Outcome', 'Gout Suppressants/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methemoglobinemia/*chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Renal Insufficiency/drug therapy', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/drug therapy', 'Urate Oxidase/*adverse effects']",,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/07/09 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1060028013501996 [pii]', '10.1177/1060028013501996 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2013 Oct;47(10):1353-8. doi: 10.1177/1060028013501996.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) promote cycling of Rho GTPases between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound conformations. We report that ARHGAP19, a previously uncharacterised protein, is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and has an essential role in the division of T lymphocytes. Overexpression of ARHGAP19 in lymphocytes delays cell elongation and cytokinesis. Conversely, silencing of ARHGAP19 or expression of a GAP-deficient mutant induces precocious mitotic cell elongation and cleavage furrow ingression, as well as excessive blebbing. In relation to these phenotypes, we show that ARHGAP19 acts as a GAP for RhoA, and controls recruitment of citron and myosin II to the plasma membrane of mitotic lymphocytes as well as Rock2-mediated phosphorylation of vimentin, which is crucial to maintain the stiffness and shape of lymphocytes. In addition to its effects on cell shape, silencing of ARHGAP19 in lymphocytes also impairs chromosome segregation.","['David, Muriel D', 'Petit, Dominique', 'Bertoglio, Jacques']","['David MD', 'Petit D', 'Bertoglio J']","['Inserm U749, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131120,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (ARHGAP19 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (citron-kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Myosin Type II)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', '*Chromosome Segregation/drug effects', '*Cytokinesis/drug effects', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Myosin Type II/metabolism', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prometaphase/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vimentin/metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.135079 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.135079 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2014 Jan 15;127(Pt 2):400-10. doi: 10.1242/jcs.135079.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: 110 children (aged 1 month-16 years). INTERVENTION: Anthracycline (doxorubicin and/or daunorubicin). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: All children who received anthracycline as chemotherapy and three echocardiographic evaluations (baseline, 1 month and 1 year) between July 2010 and June 2012 were prospectively analysed for cardiac dysfunction. Statistical analysis including systolic and diastolic functions at baseline, 1 month and 1 year was carried out by repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Mean age was 74+/-44 months and 75 (68.2%) were males. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was seen in 70 (64%) patients. Doxorubicin alone was used in 59 (54%) and combination therapy was used in 35 (32%). A cumulative dose of anthracycline <300 mg/m(2) was used in 95 (86%). Fifteen (14%) children developed cardiac dysfunction within a month and 28 (25%) children within a year. Of these 10/15 (66.6%) and 12/28 (43%) had isolated diastolic dysfunction, respectively, while 5/15 (33.3%) and 16/28 (57%) had combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Seven (6.4%) patients expired due to severe cardiac dysfunction. Eight of 59 (13.5%) children showed dose-related cardiotoxicity (p=<0.001). Cardiotoxicity was also high when the combination of doxorubicin and daunorubicin was used (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is high.

Overexpression of HOXA9, HOXA10, and MEIS1 was observed in AML patients with MOZ fusions. To assess the functional role of HOX upregulation in leukemogenesis by MOZ-TIF2, we focused on bromodomain-PHD finger protein 1 (BRPF1), a component of the MOZ complex that carries out histone acetylation for generating and maintaining proper epigenetic programs in hematopoietic cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that MOZ-TIF2 forms a stable complex with BRPF1, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that MOZ-TIF2 and BRPF1 interact with HOX genes in MOZ-TIF2-induced AML cells. Depletion of BRPF1 decreased the MOZ localization on HOX genes, resulting in loss of transformation ability induced by MOZ-TIF2. Furthermore, mutant MOZ-TIF2 engineered to lack histone acetyltransferase activity was incapable of deregulating HOX genes as well as initiating leukemia. These data indicate that MOZ-TIF2/BRPF1 complex upregulates HOX genes mediated by MOZ-dependent histone acetylation, leading to the development of leukemia. We suggest that activation of BRPF1/HOX pathway through MOZ HAT activity is critical for MOZ-TIF2 to induce AML.","['Shima, Haruko', 'Yamagata, Kazutsune', 'Aikawa, Yukiko', 'Shino, Mika', 'Koseki, Haruhiko', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki', 'Kitabayashi, Issay']","['Shima H', 'Yamagata K', 'Aikawa Y', 'Shino M', 'Koseki H', 'Shimada H', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131121,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BRPF1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MOZ-TIF2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs']",,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/07/19 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1466-x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Jan;99(1):21-31. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1466-x.

However, they are of limited value before the age of 2 years. Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) and nevus anemicus (NA) are commonly observed in children with NF1 and may be useful diagnostic clues. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency of JXG and NA, to describe their clinical features, and to determine their diagnostic value in patients with NF1. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective medical record review of outpatients seen between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011. University hospital dermatology department affiliated with the French NF1 referral center network. Patients with NF1 diagnosed by at least 2 National Institutes of Health criteria and examined at our department. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of patients with NF1 who had JXG or NA categorized into 4 age groups. RESULTS: Among 72 patients with NF1 (median age, 15.4 years), 23 had JXG (10%) or NA (25%). Both lesions were more frequent (55%) in those younger than 2 years (JXG, 30%; NA, 35%). Most JXG lesions were multiple and resolved spontaneously. Cephalic and genital involvement was frequent. No patient with JXG developed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Nevus anemicus was present on the neck and upper chest in 72% of cases. Among 10 patients (14%) who had only 1 diagnostic criterion at first visit, including 9 younger than 2 years, JXG or NA was present in 8 (80%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found a high frequency of JXG and NA in patients with NF1, especially in children younger than 2 years with fewer than 2 diagnostic criteria. Hence, JXG and NA appear helpful in improving early diagnosis of NF1 in young children and infants.","['Ferrari, Faustine', 'Masurel, Alice', 'Olivier-Faivre, Laurence', 'Vabres, Pierre']","['Ferrari F', 'Masurel A', 'Olivier-Faivre L', 'Vabres P']","['Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Dijon4Centre de Competence Maladies Rares Neurofibromatose 1, Dijon, France.', 'Medical Genetics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Dijon4Centre de Competence Maladies Rares Neurofibromatose 1, Dijon, France.', 'Medical Genetics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Dijon3Research Unit EA 4271 Genetique des Anomalies du Developpement, Universite de Bourgogne, PRES Bourgogne-Franche Comte, France4Centre de Competence Maladies Rares Neurofibromatose 1, Dijon, France.', 'Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Dijon3Research Unit EA 4271 Genetique des Anomalies du Developpement, Universite de Bourgogne, PRES Bourgogne-Franche Comte, France4Centre de Competence Maladies Rares Neurofibromatose 1, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Dermatol,JAMA dermatology,101589530,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'France', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Nevus/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/03/14 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1783062 [pii]', '10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.6434 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Dermatol. 2014 Jan;150(1):42-6. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.6434.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance and intolerance have frequently been reported, particularly in patients with advanced-stage disease. Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding are the most critical cause of imatinib resistance. To overcome this resistance, four second-generation ATP competitive ABL TKIs, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and bafetinib, have been developed. Dasatinib and nilotinib also demonstrated higher efficacy than imatinib in previously untreated CML patients in chronic phase. Despite promising clinical results, the frequently observed mutant T315I is not effectively targeted by any of the second-generation ABL TKIs. Thus, a third-generation ABL TKI, ponatinib, was developed to inhibit all mutated BCR-ABL and showed clinical efficacy in CML cells harbouring T315I. CML treatment is rapidly progressing and further evolution is surely expected. Moreover, it was recently reported that some CML patients who achieved sustained complete molecular response could stop TKI. CML may become the first human cancer to be conquered solely with oral medicines.","['Kimura, Shinya', 'Ando, Toshihiko', 'Kojima, Kensuke']","['Kimura S', 'Ando T', 'Kojima K']","['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan, shkimu@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131122,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/10/16 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10147-013-0641-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2014 Feb;19(1):3-9. doi: 10.1007/s10147-013-0641-7.

In the present study, the testicular tissues were isolated from 1-d-old male chickens to establish primary cell cultures. This culture led to development of distinguished colonies which were further characterized by alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity assay and gene expression analysis. They were shown to be positive for AP activity and expressed two main transcription factors of OCT4 and STRA8 as indicated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These were indications of carrying characteristics of SSCs by these colonies. The cultures were also exposed to different concentrations of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) growth factors to seek optimum colony-forming conditions.

Inconsistent with its tumor suppressor role, elevated WT1 levels have been observed in leukemia and solid tumors. WT1 has also been suggested to act as an oncogene by inducing the expression of MYC and BCL-2. However, these are only the correlational studies, and no functional study has been performed to date. Consistent with its tumor suppressor role, CDC73 binds to RNA polymerase II as part of a PAF1 transcriptional regulatory complex and causes transcriptional repression of oncogenes MYC and CCND1. It also represses beta-catenin-mediated transcription. Based on the reduced level of CDC73 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) samples in the absence of loss-of-heterozygosity, promoter methylation, and mutations, we speculated that an inhibitory transcription factor is regulating its expression. The bioinformatics analysis predicted WT1 as an inhibitory transcription factor to regulate the CDC73 level. Our results showed that overexpression of WT1 decreased CDC73 levels and promoted proliferation of OSCC cells. ChIP and EMSA results demonstrated binding of WT1 to the CDC73 promoter. The 5-azacytidine treatment of OSCC cells led to an up-regulation of WT1 with a concomitant down-regulation of CDC73, further suggesting regulation of CDC73 by WT1. Exogenous CDC73 attenuated the protumorigenic activity of WT1 by apoptosis induction. An inverse correlation between expression levels of CDC73 and WT1 was observed in OSCC samples. These observations indicated that WT1 functions as an oncogene by repressing the expression of CDC73 in OSCC. We suggest that targeting WT1 could be a therapeutic strategy for cancer, including OSCC.","['Rather, Mohammad Iqbal', 'Swamy, Shivananda', 'Gopinath, Kodaganur S', 'Kumar, Arun']","['Rather MI', 'Swamy S', 'Gopinath KS', 'Kumar A']","['From the Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development, and Genetics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131120,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDC73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mouth Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3887219,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)41566-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.483255 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jan 10;289(2):968-76. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.483255.

METHODS: The morphological features of LSC in culture in vitro was observed by flow cytometry. The immunophenotype was assessed by detective flow cytometry. The chromosome karyotype was analyzed by R-banding technique. RESULTS: The LSC showed suspended floating colonies growing in the culture medium, and grew well and proliferated constantly in culture over 8 months. Among the 13 children with AML, there were 10 CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) and CD33(+) cases, 10 CD44(+) cases, 10 CD96(+) cases, and 5 CD90(+) cases. Among the 13 children with B-ALL, there were 6 CD34(+)CD20(-)CD19(+) cases, 7 CD9(+) cases, and 5 CD123(+) cases. Among the 9 children with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), there were 5 CD34(+)CD7(-) and CD90(+) cases, and 4 CD123(+) cases. Among the 13 cases of AML, 5 cases showed chromosome translocation t(15;17), one case chromosome translocation t(8;21), and 7 cases showed no chromosome karyotype abnormality.

In this 'separate sampling' scenario, the data cannot be used to estimate the class prior probabilities. Moreover, predetermined class sizes can severely degrade classifier performance, even for large samples. RESULTS: We employ simulations using both synthetic and real data to show the detrimental effect of separate sampling on a variety of classification rules. We establish propositions related to the effect on the expected classifier error owing to a sampling ratio different from the population class ratio. From these we derive a sample-based minimax sampling ratio and provide an algorithm for approximating it from the data. We also extend to arbitrary distributions the classical population-based Anderson linear discriminant analysis minimax sampling ratio derived from the discriminant form of the Bayes classifier.

Despite the success of targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, CML remains largely incurable, most likely due to the treatment resistance after firstly chemical therapy. So know well the unique molecular pathway of CML is very important. METHODS: The expressions of CD44 in different leukemia patients and cell lines were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. The effects of CD44 on proliferation of K562 cells were determined using the MTT and colony formation assays, and even in a nude mouse transplantation model. Then, the cell cycle changes were detected by flow cytometric analysis and the early apoptosis of cells was detected by the annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining assay. The expressions of the cycles and apoptosis-related proteins p21, Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 were analyzed by western blot and real-time PCR assay. Finally, the decreased nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was detected by western blotting and immunefluorescence. RESULTS: Firstly, we showed that CD44 expression was increased in several kinds of leukemia patients and K562 cells. By contrast, the down-regulation of CD44 resulted in decreased proliferation with a G0/G1 arrest of cell cycle in K562 cells according to the MTT assay and the flow cytometric analysis. And no significant induction of both the early and late phases of apoptosis was shown by the annexin V-FITC and PI staining. During this process, p21 and cyclin D1 are the major causes for cell cycle arrest. In addition, we found CD44 down-regulation decreased the expression of beta-catenin and increased the expression of phosphorylated beta-catenin. The instability of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway induced by increased expression of p-beta-catenin resulted in a decreased nuclear accumulation in CD44 silenced K562 cells. In the nude mouse transplantation model, we also found the same results. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that K562 cells depend to a greater extent on CD44 for proliferation, and CD44 down-regulation may induce a cell cycle arrest through Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. CD44 blockade may be beneficial in therapy of CML.","['Chang, Guoqiang', 'Zhang, Hongju', 'Wang, Jian', 'Zhang, Yujuan', 'Xu, Hua', 'Wang, Chijuan', 'Zhang, Hairui', 'Ma, Li', 'Li, Qinghua', 'Pang, Tianxiang']","['Chang G', 'Zhang H', 'Wang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu H', 'Wang C', 'Zhang H', 'Ma L', 'Li Q', 'Pang T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Nanjing Road 288, Tianjin 300020, China. pang@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131120,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC4176735,2013/11/22 06:00,2013/11/22 06:01,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/22 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-13-117 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-13-117 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2013 Nov 20;13(1):117. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-13-117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We sought to retrospectively analyze the epidemiology of the first episode of bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections 0-30 days post transplant in a cohort of 320 children and adolescents who underwent autologous HSCT in a single institution, between 1990 and 2009 for solid tumors or lymphoma, and in 65 children transplanted for acute leukemia during the same period. RESULTS: Infections occurred in 66 (21%) patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. Bacterial infections occurred in 33 (10%) including bacteremia in 23 (7%), and viral infections in 34 (11%) patients. Gram-positive bacterial infections were more prevalent than gram-negative bacterial infections (P = 0.03). Infections caused by fungal or parasitic pathogens were uncommon. The decade when transplant was performed (1990-1999 vs. 2000-2009) had no impact on the incidence of bacterial (P = 0.41) or viral (P = 0.47) infection. Between 1990 and 1999, a total of 60 (92%) children were transplanted for leukemia, and 5 (8%) in the 2000-2009 period (P < 0.0001). Infections occurred in 32 (49%) patients. Bacterial (P = 0.004), candidal (P = 0.003), and herpes simplex viral (P = 0.03) infections were more common in patients transplanted for leukemia. In patients transplanted for leukemia, 3 deaths occurred attributed to infection, all before 2000. CONCLUSION: Changes in epidemiology of infection are likely a result of decline in autologous transplantation for childhood leukemia in the recent era. Autologous transplantation for solid tumors or lymphoma was not associated with mortality from early infections at our institution.","['Srinivasan, A', 'McLaughlin, L', 'Wang, C', 'Srivastava, D K', 'Shook, D R', 'Leung, W', 'Hayden, R T']","['Srinivasan A', 'McLaughlin L', 'Wang C', 'Srivastava DK', 'Shook DR', 'Leung W', 'Hayden RT']","[""Departments of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131121,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Candidiasis/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpes Simplex/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Parasitic Diseases/*epidemiology/parasitology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Virus Diseases/*epidemiology/virology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4003497,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/10/23 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12165 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2014 Feb;16(1):90-7. doi: 10.1111/tid.12165.

This study investigated morphological and biological progression at the early stage of porcine somatic cell reprogramming, and explored suitable conditions to increase the induction efficiency of piPSCs. A cocktail of defined transcription factors was used to generate piPSCs. The amphotropic retrovirus, which carried human OCT4 (O), SOX2 (S), KLF4 (K), C-MYC (M), TERT (T), and GFP, were used to infect porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEFs). The number of clones derived from OSKM (4F) and OSKMT (4F+T) was significantly higher than that from SKM (3F) and SKMT (3F+T), suggesting that OCT4 played a critical role in regulating porcine cell reprogramming. The number of alkaline phosphatase-positive clones from a medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (M1 medium) was significantly higher than that with insulin and 2i PD0325901/CHIR99021 (M2 medium), indicating that insulin and 2i could not effectively maintain piPSC propagation. In the M1 medium, piPSC lines could not maintain the typical self-renewal morphology on gelatin-coated and Matrigel-coated plates. Without the mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder, piPSCs started to simultaneously differentiate. Based on the potential for self-renewal and activation of pluripotent markers, we found that the culture condition of 4F+T plus LIF and bFGF plus MEF feeder promoted PEF reprogramming more efficiently than the other conditions tested here. Two piPSC lines (IB-1 and IB-2) were derived and maintained for up to 20 passages in vitro.","['Gao, Yi', 'Guo, Yanjie', 'Duan, Anqin', 'Cheng, De', 'Zhang, Shiqiang', 'Wang, Huayan']","['Gao Y', 'Guo Y', 'Duan A', 'Cheng D', 'Zhang S', 'Wang H']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, College of Veterinary Medicine , Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131120,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Swine']",,2013/11/22 06:00,2014/03/04 06:00,['2013/11/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2013.2095 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2014 Jan;33(1):1-11. doi: 10.1089/dna.2013.2095.

METHOD: A 18-months retrospective observational study (January 2011-June 2012) which included all patients diagnosed with CML in a secondary hospital (550 beds) and were treated with imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib. It was collected the following variables: sex, age at diagnosis, years of treatment and side effects. Adherence was evaluated using SMAQ questionnaire and recording dispensations. RESULTS: 25 patients were included and all but two (92.0%) experienced side effects to imatinib,83.3% to dasatinib and 66.7% to nilotinib. The average adherence was 71.3%. There was identified as possible parameters of lack of adherence the female patients (55.6 % vs. 66.7%, p = 0.586), older than 50 (55.6 % vs. 83.3 %, p = 0.125), more than four years of treatment (70.0 % vs. 57.1 %, p = 0.521) and the presence of certain side effects (gastrointestinal disorders and musculoeskeletal pain).

Studies of PML function in hematopoietic differentiation previously focused principally on its myeloid activities and also indicated that PML is involved in erythroid colony formation. However, the exact role that PML plays in erythropoiesis is essentially unknown. In this report, we found that PML4, a specific PML isoform expressed in erythroid cells, promotes endogenous erythroid genes expression in K562 and primary human erythroid cells. We show that the PML4 effect is GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1) dependent using GATA-1 knockout/rescued G1E/G1E-ER4 cells. PML4, but not other detected PML isoforms, directly interacts with GATA-1 and can recruit it into PML nuclear bodies.

Finally, we present evidence that PML4 enhances GATA-1 occupancy within the globin gene cluster and stimulates cooperation between GATA-1 and its coactivator p300.

First observed under an electron microscope, they were originally described as dense bodies found in the nucleus. They are known by a number of other names, including Promyelocytic Leukemia bodies (PML bodies), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. ND10 are frequently associated with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. It has been suggested that they play a role in regulating gene transcription. ND10 were originally characterized using human autoantisera, which recognizes Speckled Protein of 100 kDa, from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. At the immunohistochemical level, ND10 appear as nuclear punctate structures, with 10 indicating the approximate number of dots per nucleus observed. ND10 do not colocalize with kinetochores, centromeres, sites of mRNA processing, or chromosomes. Resistance of ND10 antigens to nuclease digestion and salt extraction suggest that ND10 are associated with the nuclear matrix. They are often identified by immunofluorescent assay using specific antibodies against PML, Death domain-associated protein, nuclear dot protein (NDP55), and so on. The role of ND10 has long been the subject of investigation, with the specific connection of ND10 and viral infection having been a particular focus for almost 20 years. This review summarizes the relationship of ND10 and viral infection.

The spectrum of acute lymphoblastic leukemia genetic abnormalities is nevertheless rapidly expanding. Therefore, newly described chromosomal aberrations are likely to have an impact on clinical care in the near future. Recently, the rare intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 started to be considered a high-risk chromosomal abnormality. It occurs in approximately 2-5% of pediatric patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This abnormality is associated with a poor outcome. Hence, an accurate detection of this abnormality is expected to become very important in the choice of appropriate therapy.

METHODS: Fifty-nine children with acute lymphocytic leukemia from three institutions in Minas Gerais, Brazil, were prospectively studied. Clonal rearrangements were detected by polymerase chain reaction followed by homo/heteroduplex clonality analysis in DNA samples from diagnostic bone marrow. Follow-up samples were collected on Days 14 and 28-35 of the induction phase. The Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox methods were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor rearrangements were not detected in 5/55 children screened (9.0%). For precursor-B acute lymphocytic leukemia, the most frequent rearrangement was IgH (72.7%), then TCRG (61.4%), and TCRD and IgK (47.7%); for T-acute lymphocytic leukemia, TCRG (80.0%), and TCRD and Sil-Tal deletion (20.0%) were the most common. Minimal residual disease was detected in 35% of the cases on Day 14 and in 22.5% on Day 28-35. Minimal residual disease on Day 28-35, T-acute lymphocytic leukemia, and leukocyte count above 50 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis were bad prognostic factors for leukemia-free survival in univariate analysis. Relapse risk for minimal residual disease positive relative to minimal residual disease negative children was 8.5 times higher (95% confidence interval: 1.02-70.7). CONCLUSION: Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor rearrangement frequencies were similar to those reported before. Minimal residual disease is an independent prognostic factor for leukemia-free survival, even when based on a non-quantitative technique, but longer follow-ups are needed.","['Assumpcao, Juliana Godoy', 'Paula, Francisco Danilo Ferreira', 'Xavier, Sandra Guerra', 'Murao, Mitiko', 'de Aguirre, Joaquim Caetano Neto', 'Dutra, Alvaro Pimenta', 'Lima, Eduardo Ribeiro', 'de Oliveira, Benigna Maria', 'Viana, Marcos Borato']","['Assumpcao JG', 'Paula FD', 'Xavier SG', 'Murao M', 'de Aguirre JC Neto', 'Dutra AP', 'Lima ER', 'de Oliveira BM', 'Viana MB']","['Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,,PMC3832314,2013/11/21 06:00,2013/11/21 06:01,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20130115 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2013;35(5):337-42. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20130115.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gene rearrangement', 'Neoplasm, residual', 'Polymerase chain reaction', 'Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This task includes not only the identification of proteins in a sample, but also the accurate quantification of their abundance. Although mass spectrometry typically provides information on peptide identity and abundance in a sample, it does not directly measure the concentration of the corresponding proteins. Specifically, most mass-spectrometry-based approaches (e.g. shotgun proteomics or selected reaction monitoring) allow one to quantify peptides using chromatographic peak intensities or spectral counting information. Ultimately, based on these measurements, one wants to infer the concentrations of the corresponding proteins. Inferring properties of the proteins based on experimental peptide evidence is often a complex problem because of the ambiguity of peptide assignments and different chemical properties of the peptides that affect the observed concentrations. We present SCAMPI, a novel generic and statistically sound framework for computing protein abundance scores based on quantified peptides. In contrast to most previous approaches, our model explicitly includes information from shared peptides to improve protein quantitation, especially in eukaryotes with many homologous sequences. The model accounts for uncertainty in the input data, leading to statistical prediction intervals for the protein scores. Furthermore, peptides with extreme abundances can be reassessed and classified as either regular data points or actual outliers. We used the proposed model with several datasets and compared its performance to that of other, previously used approaches for protein quantification in bottom-up mass spectrometry.","['Gerster, Sarah', 'Kwon, Taejoon', 'Ludwig, Christina', 'Matondo, Mariette', 'Vogel, Christine', 'Marcotte, Edward M', 'Aebersold, Ruedi', 'Buhlmann, Peter']","['Gerster S', 'Kwon T', 'Ludwig C', 'Matondo M', 'Vogel C', 'Marcotte EM', 'Aebersold R', 'Buhlmann P']","['Seminar for Statistics, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich, Ramistrasse 101, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland;']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131119,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Databases, Protein/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', 'Leptospira interrogans/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Markov Chains', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'Proteomics/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Research Design', 'Software']",PMC3916661,2013/11/21 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)34652-1 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M112.025445 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2014 Feb;13(2):666-77. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M112.025445.

The most common FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia are internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (23%) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (10%). The mutation substituting the aspartic acid at position 838 (equivalent to the human aspartic acid residue at position 835) with a tyrosine (referred to as FLT3/D835Y hereafter) is the most frequent kinase domain mutation, converting aspartic acid to tyrosine. Although both of these mutations constitutively activate FLT3, patients with an ITD mutation have a significantly poorer prognosis. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this prognostic difference, we have generated a knock-in mouse model with a D838Y point mutation in FLT3 that corresponds to the FLT3/D835Y mutation described in humans. Compared with FLT3/ITD knock-in mice, the FLT3/D835Y knock-in mice survive significantly longer. The majority of these mice develop myeloproliferative neoplasms with a less-aggressive phenotype. In addition, FLT3/D835Y mice have distinct hematopoietic development patterns. Unlike the tremendous depletion of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment we have observed in FLT3/ITD mice, FLT3/D835Y mutant mice are not depleted in hematopoietic stem cells. Further comparisons of these FLT3/D835Y knock-in mice with FLT3/ITD mice should provide an ideal platform for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that underlie the prognostic differences between the two different types of FLT3 mutations.","['Bailey, Emily', 'Li, Li', 'Duffield, Amy S', 'Ma, Hayley S', 'Huso, David L', 'Small, Don']","['Bailey E', 'Li L', 'Duffield AS', 'Ma HS', 'Huso DL', 'Small D']","['Departments of Oncology, Pathology, and Pediatrics, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131119,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques/*methods', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Models, Animal', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Segmental Duplications, Genomic/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC3876267,2013/11/21 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1310559110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1310559110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Dec 24;110(52):21113-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310559110.

We propose a method to estimate a dynamic treatment regimen-specific median residual life (MERL) function from sequential multiple assignment randomized trials. We present the MERL estimator, which is based on inverse probability weighting, as well as, two variance estimates for the MERL estimator. One variance estimate follows from Lunceford, Davidian and Tsiatis' 2002 survival function-based variance estimate and the other uses the sandwich estimator. The MERL estimator is evaluated, and its two variance estimates are compared through simulation studies, showing that the estimator and both variance estimates produce approximately unbiased results in large samples. To demonstrate our methods, the estimator has been applied to data from a sequentially randomized leukemia clinical trial.","['Kidwell, Kelley M', 'Ko, Jin H', 'Wahed, Abdus S']","['Kidwell KM', 'Ko JH', 'Wahed AS']","['Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131120,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Statistics as Topic/*methods', '*Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4153353,2013/11/21 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.6042 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2014 Apr 30;33(9):1503-13. doi: 10.1002/sim.6042.

The courts have also been addressing a wide range of compensation claims for exposures to toxic chemicals with demonstration of causation being a particularly difficult task. Meanwhile, the Congress has been attempting to legislate a far reaching administrative and judicial framework for compensating toxic victims, including an easing of burden-of-proof requirements for demonstrating causation and a broadening of the basis for admissibility of scientific evidence. Drawing parallels between radiation and toxic exposure problems can be both instructive and misleading. Some of the technical issues are quite similar, including the importance of person-specific exposure estimates and of epidemiological studies. However, the uncertainties associated with toxic exposures are usually far greater, and the scientific data base for relating exposures and effects is much more uncertain.","['Schweitzer, G E']",['Schweitzer GE'],"['Science Policy Studies, Environmental Research Center, University of Nevada at Las Vegas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Environ Monit Assess,Environmental monitoring and assessment,8508350,,,,,1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['1985/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/BF00396603 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Monit Assess. 1987 Jan;8(1):1-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00396603.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of ALL is heterogeneous and may be at least in part caused by genetic alterations. Although the modern sequencing technologies make it possible to rapidly discover novel genetic and epigenetic alterations and molecular targets for therapeutic intervention for ALL, conventional chemotherapy is still the most important therapeutic approach. Relapses and high morbidity and mortality remain major challenges particularly in adult patients with ALL. Therefore, development of novel chemotherapeutic agents remains in demand for ALL patients. In the course of seeking novel agents against ALL, we screened a library of small molecules and identified that PQJS380, a S-(E)-4-([7S,10S]-4-ethyl-7-isopropyl-2,5,8,12-tetraoxo-9-oxa-3,6,13,18-tetraaza- bicycle[13,2,1] octadec-1-en-10-yl)but-3-enyl octanethioate, showed potent anti-leukemia activity. PQJS380 inhibited the proliferation with IC 50 values of 14.25 nM and 5 nM in REH and NALM-6 cells, respectively. PQJS380 had 10-fold higher molar potency than the front-line ALL drugs Ara-C and VP-16. The median IC 50 value for leukemia blast cells from 17 patients with ALL was 52 nM. PQJS380 induced G 1-phase arrest in REH cells, and S-phase in NALM-6 cells, respectively. Treatment of PQJS380 led to apoptosis in ALL cell lines (REH and NALM-6) and primary ALL cells. Our data supported that PQJS380 may be a promising lead compound for ALL treatment even though the precise targets remain to be elucidated.","['Zhu, Xiaohui', 'Chen, Li', 'Jiang, Sheng', 'Chen, Chun', 'Yao, Yiwu', 'Chen, Dong', 'Xue, Hongman', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Zhu X', 'Chen L', 'Jiang S', 'Chen C', 'Yao Y', 'Chen D', 'Xue H', 'Pan J']","['Department of Pathophysiology; Zhongshan School of Medicine; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China; Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control; Sun Yat-sen University; Ministry of Education; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology; Zhongshan School of Medicine; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China; Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control; Sun Yat-sen University; Ministry of Education; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology and Institute of Chemical Biology; Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Science Park; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics; Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology and Institute of Chemical Biology; Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Science Park; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology and Institute of Chemical Biology; Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Science Park; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics; Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology; Zhongshan School of Medicine; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China; Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control; Sun Yat-sen University; Ministry of Education; Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131119,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azabicyclo Compounds)', '0', '(S-4-(4-ethyl-7-isopropyl-2,5,8,12-tetraoxo-9-oxa-3,6,13,18-tetraazabicyclo(13,2,', '1)octadec-1-en-10-yl)but-3-enyl octanethioate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azabicyclo Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",PMC3938514,2013/11/21 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['27145 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.27145 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2014 Jan;15(1):119-27. doi: 10.4161/cbt.27145.

CK2 phosphorylates PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor, resulting in PTEN stabilization and functional inactivation. Downregulation of PTEN activity has an impact on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which is of fundamental importance for T-ALL cell survival. These observations lend compelling weight to the application of CK2 inhibitors in the therapy of T-ALL. Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of CX-4945-a novel, highly specific, orally available, ATP-competitive inhibitor of CK2alpha. We show that CX-4945 treatment induced apoptosis in T-ALL cell lines and patient T lymphoblasts. CX-4945 downregulated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in leukemic cells. Notably, CX-4945 affected the unfolded protein response (UPR), as demonstrated by a significant decrease in the levels of the main UPR regulator GRP78/BIP, and led to apoptosis via upregulation of the ER stress/UPR cell death mediators IRE1alpha and CHOP. In vivo administration of CX-4945 to a subcutaneous xenotransplant model of human T-ALL significantly delayed tumor growth. Our findings indicate that modulation of the ER stress/UPR signaling through CK2 inhibition could be exploited for inducing apoptosis in T-ALL cells and that CX-4945 may be an efficient treatment for those T-ALLs displaying upregulation of CK2alpha/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.","['Buontempo, F', 'Orsini, E', 'Martins, L R', 'Antunes, I', 'Lonetti, A', 'Chiarini, F', 'Tabellini, G', 'Evangelisti, C', 'Evangelisti, C', 'Melchionda, F', 'Pession, A', 'Bertaina, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Cappellini, A', 'Barata, J T', 'Martelli, A M']","['Buontempo F', 'Orsini E', 'Martins LR', 'Antunes I', 'Lonetti A', 'Chiarini F', 'Tabellini G', 'Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Melchionda F', 'Pession A', 'Bertaina A', 'Locatelli F', 'McCubrey JA', 'Cappellini A', 'Barata JT', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '1] Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Pavia, Italy [2] Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology and Immunology, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', '1] Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Pavia, Italy [2] Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit 'Lalla Seragnoli', S.

First, we discuss data from already approved and active agents (including second- and third-generation proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory agents and alkylators). Next, we focus on agents with novel mechanisms of action, such as monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), cell cycle-specific drugs, deacetylase inhibitors, agents acting on the unfolded protein response, signaling transduction pathway inhibitors and kinase inhibitors. Among this plethora of new agents or mechanisms, some are specially promising: anti-CD38 MoAb, such as daratumumab, are the first antibodies with clinical activity as single agents in MM. Moreover, the kinesin spindle protein inhibitor Arry-520 is effective in monotherapy as well as in combination with dexamethasone in heavily pretreated patients. Immunotherapy against MM is also being explored, and probably the most attractive example of this approach is the combination of the anti-CS1 MoAb elotuzumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, which has produced exciting results in the relapsed/refractory setting.","['Ocio, E M', 'Richardson, P G', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Palumbo, A', 'Mateos, M V', 'Orlowski, R', 'Kumar, S', 'Usmani, S', 'Roodman, D', 'Niesvizky, R', 'Einsele, H', 'Anderson, K C', 'Dimopoulos, M A', 'Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Mellqvist, U-H', 'Turesson, I', 'Merlini, G', 'Schots, R', 'McCarthy, P', 'Bergsagel, L', 'Chim, C S', 'Lahuerta, J J', 'Shah, J', 'Reiman, A', 'Mikhael, J', 'Zweegman, S', 'Lonial, S', 'Comenzo, R', 'Chng, W J', 'Moreau, P', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Ludwig, H', 'Durie, B G M', 'Miguel, J F S']","['Ocio EM', 'Richardson PG', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Palumbo A', 'Mateos MV', 'Orlowski R', 'Kumar S', 'Usmani S', 'Roodman D', 'Niesvizky R', 'Einsele H', 'Anderson KC', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Mellqvist UH', 'Turesson I', 'Merlini G', 'Schots R', 'McCarthy P', 'Bergsagel L', 'Chim CS', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Shah J', 'Reiman A', 'Mikhael J', 'Zweegman S', 'Lonial S', 'Comenzo R', 'Chng WJ', 'Moreau P', 'Sonneveld P', 'Ludwig H', 'Durie BG', 'Miguel JF']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital and Cancer Research Center, University of Salamanca-IBSAL, IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital and Cancer Research Center, University of Salamanca-IBSAL, IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'M.I.R.T.

Current recommended regimens for prophylaxis against PCP range from daily administration to 3 consecutive days per week dosing. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective survey of the regimens adopted for the PCP prophylaxis in all patients treated for childhood cancer at pediatric hematology-oncology centers of the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica. RESULTS: The 20 centers participating in the study reported a total of 2466 patients, including 1093 with solid tumor and 1373 with leukemia/lymphoma (or primary immunodeficiency; n = 2). Of these patients, 1371 (55.6%) received the 3-day/week prophylaxis regimen, 406 (16.5%) received the 2-day/week regimen, and 689 (27.9%), including 439 with leukemia/lymphoma, received the 1-day/week regimen. Overall, only 2 cases of PCP (0.08%) were reported, both in the 2-day/week group. By intention to treat, the cumulative incidence of PCP at 3 years was 0.09% overall (95% CI, 0.00-0.40%) and 0.51% for the 2-day/week group (95% CI, 0.10%-2.00%). Remarkably, both patients who failed had withdrawn from prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: A single-day course of prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be sufficient to prevent PCP in children with cancer undergoing intensive chemotherapy regimens. This simplified strategy might have implications for the emerging need for PCP prophylaxis in other patients subjected to the increased use of biological and nonbiological agents that induce higher levels of immune suppression, such as those with rheumatic diseases.","['Caselli, Desiree', 'Petris, Maria Grazia', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Carraro, Francesca', 'Colombini, Antonella', 'Muggeo, Paola', 'Ziino, Ottavio', 'Melchionda, Fraia', 'Russo, Giovanna', 'Pierani, Paolo', 'Soncini, Elena', 'DeSantis, Raffaella', 'Zanazzo, Giulio', 'Barone, Angelica', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Cellini, Monica', 'Mura, Rossella', 'Milano, Giuseppe M', 'Meazza, Cristina', 'Cicalese, Maria P', 'Tropia, Serena', 'De Masi, Salvatore', 'Castagnola, Elio', 'Arico, Maurizio']","['Caselli D', 'Petris MG', 'Rondelli R', 'Carraro F', 'Colombini A', 'Muggeo P', 'Ziino O', 'Melchionda F', 'Russo G', 'Pierani P', 'Soncini E', 'DeSantis R', 'Zanazzo G', 'Barone A', 'Cesaro S', 'Cellini M', 'Mura R', 'Milano GM', 'Meazza C', 'Cicalese MP', 'Tropia S', 'De Masi S', 'Castagnola E', 'Arico M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Padua, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Lalla Seragnoli Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', ""Pediatric Onco-Hematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Turin, Italy."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Bari, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, ARNAS Civico, Palermo, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Lalla Seragnoli Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Catania, Italy.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, G Salesi Women's and Children's Hospital, Ancona, Italy."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, BMT Unit, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.', 'Pediatric and Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Policlinico, Modena, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, BMT Unit, Section of Hematology, Department of Internal and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionaledei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Pediatric Immunology, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Milan, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, ARNAS Civico, Palermo, Italy.', 'Epidemiology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Infectious Disease Unit, Gaslini Institute, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.

Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. However, emerging evidence unexpectedly demonstrates that Notch signaling can function as a potent tumor suppressor in other forms of leukemia.

In addition, the TKI resistance of LSCs is not associated with the BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. These observations indicate that TKI-insensitive LSCs and TKI-sensitive leukemic progenitor cells are biologically different, which leads us to believe that LSCs and more differentiated leukemic cells have different genetic mechanisms. Further study of LSCs to identify the novel gene signatures and mechanisms that control the function and molecular phenotype of LSCs is critical. In this mini-review, we will discuss our current understanding of the biology of LSCs and novel genes that could serve as a molecular signature of LSCs in CML. These novel genes could also serve as potential targets for eradicating LSCs in CML.","['Chen, Yaoyu', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Chen Y', 'Li S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation Street, Worcester, MA 01605, USA. shaoguang.li@umassmed.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130606,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC4177606,2013/11/21 06:00,2013/11/21 06:01,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['2013/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/21 06:01 [medline]']","['2050-7771-1-21 [pii]', '10.1186/2050-7771-1-21 [doi]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2013 Jun 6;1(1):21. doi: 10.1186/2050-7771-1-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the hypothesis that childhood susceptibility may increase as a result of in utero exposure to carcinogens and hormonally acting factors. Using cord blood samples from the NewGeneris cohort, we examined associations between a range of biomarkers of carcinogen exposure and hormonally acting factors with micronuclei (MN) frequency as a proxy measure of cancer risk. Associations with gene expression and genotype were also explored. METHODS: DNA and protein adducts, gene expression profiles, circulating hormonally acting factors, and GWAS (genome-wide association study) data were investigated in relation to genomic damage measured by MN frequency in lymphocytes from 623 newborns enrolled between 2006 and 2010 across Europe. RESULTS: Malondialdehyde DNA adducts (M1dG) were associated with increased MN frequency in binucleated lymphocytes (MNBN), and exposure to androgenic, estrogenic, and dioxin-like compounds was associated with MN frequency in mononucleated lymphocytes (MNMONO), although no monotonic exposure-outcome relationship was observed. Lower frequencies of MNBN were associated with a 1-unit increase expression of PDCD11, LATS2, TRIM13, CD28, SMC1A, IL7R, and NIPBL genes. Gene expression was significantly higher in association with the highest versus lowest category of bulky and M1dG-DNA adducts for five and six genes, respectively. Gene expression levels were significantly lower for 11 genes in association with the highest versus lowest category of plasma AR CALUX(R) (chemically activated luciferase expression for androgens) (8 genes), ERalpha CALUX(R) (for estrogens) (2 genes), and DR CALUX(R) (for dioxins). Several SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on chromosome 11 near FOLH1 significantly modified associations between androgen activity and MNBN frequency. Polymorphisms in EPHX1/2 and CYP2E1 were associated with MNBN. CONCLUSION: We measured in utero exposure to selected environmental carcinogens and circulating hormonally acting factors and detected associations with MN frequency in newborns circulating T lymphocytes. The results highlight mechanisms that may contribute to carcinogen-induced leukemia and require further research.","['Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Agramunt, Silvia', 'Anna, Livia', 'Besselink, Harrie', 'Botsivali, Maria', 'Brady, Nigel J', 'Ceppi, Marcello', 'Chatzi, Leda', 'Chen, Bowang', 'Decordier, Ilse', 'Farmer, Peter B', 'Fleming, Sarah', 'Fontana, Vincenzo', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Fthenou, Eleni', 'Gallo, Fabio', 'Georgiadis, Panagiotis', 'Gmuender, Hans', 'Godschalk, Roger W', 'Granum, Berit', 'Hardie, Laura J', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Hochstenbach, Kevin', 'Knudsen, Lisbeth E', 'Kogevinas, Manolis', 'Kovacs, Katalin', 'Kyrtopoulos, Soterios A', 'Lovik, Martinus', 'Nielsen, Jeanette K', 'Nygaard, Unni Cecilie', 'Pedersen, Marie', 'Rydberg, Per', 'Schoket, Bernadette', 'Segerback, Dan', 'Singh, Rajinder', 'Sunyer, Jordi', 'Tornqvist, Margareta', 'van Loveren, Henk', 'van Schooten, Frederik J', 'Vande Loock, Kim', 'von Stedingk, Hans', 'Wright, John', 'Kleinjans, Jos C', 'Kirsch-Volders, Micheline', 'van Delft, Joost H M']","['Merlo DF', 'Agramunt S', 'Anna L', 'Besselink H', 'Botsivali M', 'Brady NJ', 'Ceppi M', 'Chatzi L', 'Chen B', 'Decordier I', 'Farmer PB', 'Fleming S', 'Fontana V', 'Forsti A', 'Fthenou E', 'Gallo F', 'Georgiadis P', 'Gmuender H', 'Godschalk RW', 'Granum B', 'Hardie LJ', 'Hemminki K', 'Hochstenbach K', 'Knudsen LE', 'Kogevinas M', 'Kovacs K', 'Kyrtopoulos SA', 'Lovik M', 'Nielsen JK', 'Nygaard UC', 'Pedersen M', 'Rydberg P', 'Schoket B', 'Segerback D', 'Singh R', 'Sunyer J', 'Tornqvist M', 'van Loveren H', 'van Schooten FJ', 'Vande Loock K', 'von Stedingk H', 'Wright J', 'Kleinjans JC', 'Kirsch-Volders M', 'van Delft JH']","['Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Clinical Trials, Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria (AOU) San Martino-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (IST), Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131119,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Hormones)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Carcinogens/*analysis/toxicity', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Adducts/adverse effects/analysis', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/chemistry/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genotype', 'Hormones/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Malondialdehyde/adverse effects/analysis', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/drug effects']",PMC3914866,2013/11/21 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2013/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1206324 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2014 Feb;122(2):193-200. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1206324.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 46 patients were treated with either DLI (n = 28) or TKIs (n = 18) during a first relapse of CML after HCT between 1993 and 2012. The stage of relapse was the chronic phase in 37 patients and the advanced phase in 9 patients. All patients had myeloablative conditioning without T-cell depletion during HCT. The median interval between HCT and treatment for relapse was 34 (range, 2-197) months. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 146 and 70 months, respectively, 32% of the DLI group and 33% of the TKI group had died. Six (21%) patients initially treated with DLI received TKIs during a second relapse. In multivariable analyses, DLI was associated with inferior overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 37.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-625.4; P = .01), shorter failure-free survival (FFS) (HR, 21.15; 95% CI, 1.8-251; P = .02), higher cumulative incidence of failure (CIF) (HR, 19.5; 95% CI, 1.6-236.5; P = .02), and increased incidence of treatment-induced graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (68% vs. 6%; P = .001). CONCLUSION: TKIs appear better than DLI in chronic-phase relapses after myeloablative non-T-cell-depleted HCT. Outcomes were poor in advanced-phase relapses irrespective of treatment modality.","['Shanavas, Mohamed', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Kuruvilla, John', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan', 'Uhm, Jieun', 'Lambie, Anna', 'Ellis, Laura', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Shanavas M', 'Messner HA', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Atenafu EG', 'Gupta V', 'Kuruvilla J', 'Kim DD', 'Uhm J', 'Lambie A', 'Ellis L', 'Lipton JH']","['Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies are considered highly specific for RA and are directed against various citrullinated antigens, including citrullinated fibrinogen. Anti-CCP antibodies may interfere with the detection of citrullinated proteins and their function. In this article, we describe the possible inhibition of fibrinogen by anti-CCP antibodies with clinical consequences which have never been reported in the literature to our best knowledge. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 79-year-old Caucasian woman with a longstanding history of untreated seropositive RA and who had been investigated for severe neutropenia since several months. The association of splenomegaly led to suspicion of Felty's syndrome. Flux cytometry was compatible with T-cell LGL leukemia. In addition, severe hypofibrinogenemia was detected.

This can be compounded by a greater prevalence of unhealthy behaviors relative to similarly aged non-cancer peers. Disparities in health behaviors have been noted for Black and Hispanic AYASCC, but data on Asian American (AA) or Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) minorities are lacking. The purpose of this study was to help bridge these information gaps by gathering data from Hawai'i AA and NHOPI AYSCC. Telephone surveys were used to collect health behavior data from survivors 13-24 years of age (N=64); 55% of the sample was female, 77% AA or NHOPI, 63% leukemia/lymphoma survivors, and 32% overweight/obese. These were compared to state/national survey data for similarly aged individuals (Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data for 13-17 year olds, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for 18-24 year olds). While Hawai'i AYASCC had significantly lower rates of tobacco/alcohol use, a higher proportion did not eat five fruits/vegetables a day (96%) compared to state (83%) and national (78%) samples (P < .001). Although many met age-specific physical activity recommendations, 44% of <18 year olds and 29% of >/=18 year olds still failed to meet national guidelines. Low intake of fruits/vegetables and suboptimal levels of physical activity place these vulnerable, ethnic minority cancer survivors at higher risk for chronic disease. These findings underscore the need to assess and advise survivors about their diet and exercise habits as part of post-treatment care.","['Wada, Randal K', 'Glaser, Darryl W', ""Bantum, Erin O'Carroll"", 'Orimoto, Trina', 'Steffen, Alana D', 'Elia, Jennifer L', 'Albright, Cheryl L']","['Wada RK', 'Glaser DW', 'Bantum EO', 'Orimoto T', 'Steffen AD', 'Elia JL', 'Albright CL']","[""University of Hawai'i at Manoa, School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene, Honolulu, HI (R.K.W., C.L.A.).""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Hawaii J Med Public Health,Hawai'i journal of medicine & public health : a journal of Asia Pacific Medicine & Public Health,101579076,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alcohol Drinking/ethnology', 'Asians/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Diet/ethnology', 'Female', 'Hawaii/epidemiology', 'Health Behavior/*ethnology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Smoking/ethnology', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3831565,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/08/01 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Hawaii J Med Public Health. 2013 Nov;72(11):380-5.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander', 'Childhood cancer survivors', 'Nutrition', 'Physical activity']",,"['P30 CA071789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA071789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the present study was undertaken to assess the mechanism of ICD-85 effect as an anti-proliferative agent of cancer cells. The effect of ICD-85 on proliferation of HL-60 cancer cells was determined by using the MTT assay. The morphological changes of ICD-85 treated HL-60 cells were observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM). DNA fragmentation analysis was also carried out using gel electrophoresis. ICD-85 induced the marked inhibition of HL60 cell proliferation with an IC50-value of 0.04 mug/mL following 24 h of incubation. ICD-85 treated cells when compared with untreated cells, showed nuclear material condensation, endoplasmic reticulum dilation, mitochondria swelling or degradation, increased cytoplasmic vacuoles, reduction or disappearance in cytoplasmic process and decreased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was observed. The characteristic DNA ladder formation of ICD-85-treated cells in agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the results obtained through the electron microscopy.

Many Ferula species, including F. asa-foetida, synthesize terpenyloxy coumarins. One of these coumarins is umbelliprenin, which has been implicated with induction of apoptosis in some cancer cell lines. In this study induction of apoptosis by umbelliprenin on Jurkat T-CLL and Raji B-CLL cell lines was studied. In this regard, cells were incubated with various concentrations of umbelliprenin in-vitro for different times and assayed for apoptosis with annexin V-FITC/PI double staining flowcytometry method. Results showed that umbelliprenin induced apoptosis in leukemic cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and that CLL cells were more susceptible to umbelliprenin induced cell death than normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs). Moreover, we study the induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells by umbelliprenin in the presence of interleukin 4 (IL-4) as an agent that causes resistance to apoptosis in CLL cells, was also student. We showed that IL-4 can not reduce apoptotic effect of umbelliprenin. The preferential toxicity of umbelliprenin for CLL cells, supports the hypothesis that oral administration of umbelliprenin in the form of foods or folk medicines containing this coumarin, might enhance protection against the development of CLL in man with little side effects. In conclusion, umbelliprenin may be an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of CLL, and thus clinical studies with umbelliprenin may be appropriate.","['Ziai, Seyed Ali', 'Gholami, Omid', 'Iranshahi, Mehrdad', 'Zamani, Amir Hassan', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood']","['Ziai SA', 'Gholami O', 'Iranshahi M', 'Zamani AH', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M']","['Pharmacology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Pharm Res,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,101208407,,,,PMC3832171,2012/04/01 00:00,2012/04/01 00:01,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pharm Res. 2012 Spring;11(2):653-9.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'Flowcytometry', 'Interleukin 4 (IL-4)', 'Umbelliprenin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a high dose (HD) TIV was found to increase the level of antibody response in elderly patients compared to the standard dose (SD) TIV. We hypothesized that the HD TIV would be well-tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the SD TIV in pediatric subjects with ALL. PROCEDURE: This was a randomized, double-blind, phase I safety trial comparing the HD to the SD TIV in children with ALL. Our secondary objective was immunogenicity. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either the HD (60 microg) or the SD (15 microg) TIV. Local and systemic reactions were solicited, hemagglutinin inhibition titers to influenza virus antigens were measured, and monitoring labs were collected prior to and/or after each vaccination. RESULTS: Fifty subjects were enrolled (34 HD, 16 SD). Mean age was 8.5 years; 63% were male, and 80% were in maintenance therapy. There were no significant differences reported in local or systemic symptoms. No severe adverse events were attributed to vaccination. No significant differences between the HD and SD TIV groups were noted for immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were noted between the HD and SD TIV groups for solicited systemic and local reactions. Since this study was not powered for immunogenicity, a phase II trial is needed to determine the immunogenicity of HD versus SD TIV in the pediatric ALL population.","['McManus, Meghann', 'Frangoul, Haydar', 'McCullers, Jonathan A', 'Wang, Li', ""O'Shea, Alice"", 'Halasa, Natasha']","['McManus M', 'Frangoul H', 'McCullers JA', 'Wang L', ""O'Shea A"", 'Halasa N']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/BMT, University of Utah School of Medicine/Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131119,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Inactivated)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*immunology', 'Influenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Influenza, Human/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Inactivated/*administration & dosage/immunology']",PMC4310469,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24863 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):815-20. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24863.

PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 8,516 children ages 0 to <19 years with newly diagnosed ALL admitted to freestanding US children's hospitals from 1999 to 2009 using the Pediatric Health Information System database. Induction mortality risk was modeled accounting for demographics, intensive care unit-level interventions, and socioeconomic status (SES) using Cox regression. The association of ALL induction mortality with hospital-level factors including volume, hospital-wide mortality and payer mix was analyzed with multiple linear regression. RESULTS: ALL induction mortality was 1.12%. Race and patient-level SES factors were not associated with induction mortality. Patients receiving both mechanical ventilation and vasoactive infusions experienced nearly 50% mortality (hazard ratio 122.30, 95% CI 66.56-224.80). Institutions in the highest induction mortality quartile contributed 27% of all patients but nearly half of all deaths (47 of 95). Hospital payer mix was associated with ALL induction mortality after adjustment for other hospital-level factors (P = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: The overall risk of induction death is low but substantially increased in patients with cardio-respiratory and other organ failures. Induction mortality varies up to three-fold across hospitals and is correlated with hospital payer mix. Further work is needed to improve induction outcomes in hospitals with higher mortality. These data suggest an induction mortality rate of less than 1% may be an attainable national benchmark.","['Seif, Alix E', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Li, Yimei', 'Torp, Kari', 'Rheam, Douglas P', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Harris, Tracey', 'Shah, Ami', 'Hall, Matthew', 'Fieldston, Evan S', 'Kavcic, Marko', 'Vujkovic, Marijana', 'Bailey, L Charles', 'Kersun, Leslie S', 'Reilly, Anne F', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Walker, Dana M', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Seif AE', 'Fisher BT', 'Li Y', 'Torp K', 'Rheam DP', 'Huang YS', 'Harris T', 'Shah A', 'Hall M', 'Fieldston ES', 'Kavcic M', 'Vujkovic M', 'Bailey LC', 'Kersun LS', 'Reilly AF', 'Rheingold SR', 'Walker DM', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131119,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospital Mortality/*trends', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/*economics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",PMC3951664,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24855 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):846-52. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24855.

PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective epidemiologic analysis of children who screened positive for HBV (HBsAg, HbcAb) from 1999 to 2009 at a quaternary children's hospital, focusing on patients with hematologic and oncologic conditions. Descriptive statistics were generated for demographics and serologies. Follow-up of positive serologies and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 12,754 children were screened for HBV. Of 391 that screened positive, 118 had a hematologic or oncologic diagnosis. Leukemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia comprised 84% of diagnoses. The majority (98%) tested HBcAb positive but only 20% received confirmatory HBV DNA testing. Three patients (13% of those HBV DNA tested) were identified to have chronic disease. HBV was not a known pre-existing condition, and chemotherapy preceded HBV diagnosis in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with cancer or blood disorders who screened HBV positive did not receive follow-up DNA testing, exposing them to reactivation risk and delaying definitive therapy. HBcAb may be the only indicator of chronic HBV infection and DNA confirmation should be routine. Our findings suggest a significant number of additional patients eligible for HBV treatment may have been identified with reflexive DNA testing.","['Leung, Daniel H', 'Ahamba, David C', 'Pillai, Lekshmi N', 'Khan, Mahjabeen F', ""Smith, E O'Brian"", 'Mahoney, Donald H']","['Leung DH', 'Ahamba DC', 'Pillai LN', 'Khan MF', 'Smith EO', 'Mahoney DH']","[""Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, Texas; Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131119,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/blood/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/virology', 'Hepatitis B/*diagnosis/virology', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/*blood', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/*blood', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mass Screening', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/virology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Texas/epidemiology', 'Virus Activation']",,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24853 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):865-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24853.

RESULTS: Allogeneic stem cell in patients were transplanted between 1988 and 2010, 28 had an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor, 23 had an HLA-identical unrelated donor, and 9 had an 1 allele mismatched donor. The median age at time of HCT was 44 (range: 18-68) years. Conditioning therapy was myeloablative in 36 patients and consisted of a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen in 24 patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was performed with a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine A in 36 patients, and cyclosporine A plus mycophenolate mofetil in 24 patients.

PROCEDURE: We extended the previously published CoALL cohort (n = 74) to a larger cohort (n = 127) and additionally included 38 Argentine patients from ALL IC-BFM to potentially identify novel mutations and decipher a stronger discriminatory effect on the genotype/phenotype relationship with regard to early treatment response and long-term outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 101 out of 165 (61.2%) T-ALL samples revealed at least one NOTCH1 mutation, 28 of whom had combined NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations. Eight T-ALL samples (4.8%) exclusively revealed FBXW7 mutations. Fifty-six T-ALL (33.9%) exhibited a wild-type configuration of either gene. Four novel NOTCH1 mutations were identified localized in the C-terminal PEST domain, in the rarely affected LNR repeat domain and in the ankyrin domain. Novel LNR mutations may contribute to a better understanding of the structure of the NOTCH1 negative regulatory region (NRR) and the R1946 mutation in the ankyrin domain may represent an unusual loss-of-function mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, NOTCH1 pathway mutations did not affect the relapse rate and outcome of the extended T-ALL cohort uniformly treated according to CoALL protocols, although NOTCH1 mutations were associated with good response to induction therapy (P = 0.009). Individually, HD and PEST domain mutations might exert distinct functional effects on cellular homeostasis under treatment NOTCH1 pathway activity with prognostic implications.","['Gallo Llorente, L', 'Luther, H', 'Schneppenheim, R', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Felice, M', 'Horstmann, M A']","['Gallo Llorente L', 'Luther H', 'Schneppenheim R', 'Zimmermann M', 'Felice M', 'Horstmann MA']","['Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131119,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24852 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 May;61(5):788-96. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24852.

Accordingly, MYC is recognized as a major driver of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in human and zebrafish/mouse models, and uncovering the context by which MYC-mediated malignant transformation initiates and develops remains a considerable challenge. Because MYC is a very complex oncogene, highly dependent on the microenvironment and cell-intrinsic context, we generated transgenic mice (tgMyc(spo)) in which ectopic Myc activation occurs sporadically (<10(-6) thymocytes) within otherwise normal thymic environment, thereby mimicking the unicellular context in which oncogenic alterations initiate human tumors. We show that while Myc(+) clones in tgMyc(spo) mice develop and initially proliferate in thymus and the periphery, no tumor or clonal expansion progress in aging mice (n = 130), suggesting an unexpectedly low ability of Myc to initiate efficient tumorigenesis. Furthermore, to determine the relevance of this observation in human pathogenesis we analyzed a human T-ALL case at diagnosis and relapse using the molecular stigmata of V(D)J recombination as markers of malignant progression; we similarly demonstrate that despite the occurrence of TAL1 and MYC translocations in early thymocyte ontogeny, subsequent oncogenic alterations were required to drive oncogenesis. Altogether, our data suggest that although central to T-ALL, MYC overexpression per se is inefficient in triggering the cascade of events leading to malignant transformation.","['Loosveld, Marie', 'Bonnet, Melanie', 'Gon, Stephanie', 'Montpellier, Bertrand', 'Quilichini, Benoit', 'Navarro, Jean-Marc', 'Crouzet, Thomas', 'Goujart, Marie-Amelie', 'Chasson, Lionel', 'Morgado, Ester', 'Picard, Christophe', 'Hernandez, Lucie', 'Fossat, Chantal', 'Gabert, Jean', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Nadel, Bertrand', 'Payet-Bornet, Dominique']","['Loosveld M', 'Bonnet M', 'Gon S', 'Montpellier B', 'Quilichini B', 'Navarro JM', 'Crouzet T', 'Goujart MA', 'Chasson L', 'Morgado E', 'Picard C', 'Hernandez L', 'Fossat C', 'Gabert J', 'Michel G', 'Nadel B', 'Payet-Bornet D']","[""Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Aix-Marseille Universite, 13288, Marseille, France; INSERM U1104; CNRS UMR7280, 13288, Marseille, France; Department of Hematology, AP-HM La Timone, 13385, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131012,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (STIL protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*pathology', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'V(D)J Recombination']",,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/03/22 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22117 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Jan;53(1):52-66. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22117.

Although misregulation of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) family proteins has been associated with acute leukemia, the role of hSETD1A in cancer remains unknown. In this study, we report that hSETD1A and its associated H3K4me3 are upregulated in human colorectal cancer cells and patient samples. Depletion of hSETD1A inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth, colony formation, and tumor engraftment. Genome-wide expression profiling of colorectal cancer cells reveals that approximately 50% of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes are affected by the hSETD1A knockdown. We further demonstrate that hSETD1A is recruited to promoters of those Wnt signaling target genes through its interaction with beta-catenin, a master regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. The recruitment of the hSETD1A HMT complex confers promoter-associated H3K4me3 that leads to assembly of transcription preinitiation complex and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, the expression levels of hSETD1A are positively correlated with H3K4me3 enrichment at the promoters of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes and the aberrant activation of these genes in human colorectal cancer. These results provide new biologic and mechanistic insights into the cooperative role of hSETD1A and beta-catenin in regulation of Wnt target genes as well as in colorectal cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.","['Salz, Tal', 'Li, Guangyao', 'Kaye, Frederic', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Qiu, Yi', 'Huang, Suming']","['Salz T', 'Li G', 'Kaye F', 'Zhou L', 'Qiu Y', 'Huang S']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Medicine, Anatomy and Cell Biology; and Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131118,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Burden', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",PMC5484530,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/04/16 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-1400 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1400 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Feb 1;74(3):775-86. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1400.

Aberrant methylation of tumor-suppressor gene promoters has been established for many years and recently tracked to the most immature cells of MDS, suggesting that these alterations are drivers of MDS pathogenesis. In recent years, recurrent somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in DNA methylation and demethylation and in covalent histone modifications have been reported in myeloid malignancies, including MDS. Whole-genome epigenetic profiles of MDS are also emerging. In parallel with these advances in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, clinical trials have established hypomethylating agents (HMAs) as the mainstay of therapy in the advanced forms of the disease. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular machinery involved in epigenetic regulation, discuss how epigenetic alterations arise in MDS and contribute to its pathogenesis and then discuss the mode of action of HMAs in MDS.","['Itzykson, R', 'Fenaux, P']","['Itzykson R', 'Fenaux P']","['1] Hematology Department, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France [2] Universite Paris Diderot (Paris 7), Paris, France [3] INSERM U944, Paris, France.', '1] Hematology Department, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France [2] Universite Paris Diderot (Paris 7), Paris, France [3] INSERM UMR-S-940, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131119,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013343 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.343 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Mar;28(3):497-506. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.343.

It is characterized by the expression of a number of skeletal muscle-specific proteins, including MyoD and muscle alpha-actin. However, unlike normal myoblasts, RMS cells differentiate poorly both in vivo and in culture. As microRNAs are known to regulate tumorigenesis, intensive efforts have been made to identify microRNAs that are involved in RMS development. In this work, we found that miR-203 was frequently down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation in both RMS cell lines and RMS biopsies and could be reactivated by DNA-demethylating agents. Re-expression of miR-203 in RMS cells inhibited their migration and proliferation and promoted terminal myogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, miR-203 exerts its tumor-suppressive effect by directly targeting p63 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor in RMS cells, which promotes myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the Notch and the JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathways, respectively. Our work reveals that miR-203 functions as a tumor suppressor in RMS development.","['Diao, Yarui', 'Guo, Xing', 'Jiang, Lei', 'Wang, Gang', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Wan, Jun', 'Jin, Yan', 'Wu, Zhenguo']","['Diao Y', 'Guo X', 'Jiang L', 'Wang G', 'Zhang C', 'Wan J', 'Jin Y', 'Wu Z']","['From the Biomedical Research Institute, Shenzhen Peking University-Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Medical Center, 518036 Shenzhen.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131118,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MIRN203 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/genetics/metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3879574,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)41633-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.494716 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jan 3;289(1):529-39. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.494716.

The last decade has witnessed a transformation in our understanding of the genetic basis of ALL due to detailed integrative genomic profiling of large cohorts of childhood ALL. Initially using microarray based approaches, and more recently with next-generation sequencing, these studies have enabled more precise subclassification of ALL, and have shown that each ALL entity is characterized by constellations of structural and sequence mutations that typically perturb key cellular pathways including lymphoid development, cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, Ras- and tyrosine kinase-driven signaling, and epigenetic regulation. Importantly, several of the newly identified genetic alterations have entered the clinic to improve diagnosis and risk stratification, and are being pursued as new targets for therapeutic intervention. Studies of ALL have also led the way in dissecting the subclonal heterogeneity of cancer, and have shown that individual patients commonly harbor multiple related but genetically distinct subclones, and that this genetically determined clonal heterogeneity is an important determinant of relapse. In addition, genome-wide profiling has identified inherited genetic variants that influence ALL risk. Ongoing studies are deploying detailed integrative genetic transcriptomic and epigenetic sequencing to comprehensively define the genomic landscape of ALL.

Yet, reactivations of latent viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) are uncommon in untreated CLL, suggesting that antiviral responses are uncompromised. We analyzed phenotypical and functional characteristics of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in CLL patients in comparison with age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Despite increased expression of the inhibitory receptors PD1, CD160, and CD244 on total CD8(+) T cells in CLL, expression levels of these markers were decreased on CMV-tetramer(+)CD8(+) T cells. Second, cytokine production upon stimulation with both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin and CMV-peptide-loaded antigen-presenting cells was intact in CMV-tetramer(+)CD8(+) T cells. Third, CMV-tetramer(+)CD8(+) T cells of CLL patients and HCs were equally effective in killing CMV-peptide-loaded target cells. Finally, quantitative imaging flow cytometry revealed that the proportion of CD8(+) T cells forming immunologic synapses with CMV-peptide-loaded B cells was intact. In conclusion, despite evidence for global T-cell dysfunction in CLL, we show here that CLL-derived CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells display lower expression of exhaustion markers and are functionally intact.

Longterm methotrexate therapy and concurrent rheumatoid arthritis have both been independently suggested as risk factors for developing lymphoma. The mechanism has been theorized to be severe immunosuppression and an increased frequency of latent infection with pro-oncogenic viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Spontaneous remission of these malignancies has been seen after discontinuation of the methotrexate therapy. In the present study, we report the case of a patient diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and treated with methotrexate and prednisone.

The age-adjusted incidence of haematological malignancies in Japan was approximately one-half that in the US but has been increasing significantly, whereas no significant change was seen in the US [annual percent change (95% C confidence interval): Japan, +2.4% (1.7, 3.1); US, +0.1% (-0.1, 0.2)]. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) showed the largest differences in incidence, with the most remarkable differences observed for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, HL-nodular sclerosis, mycosis fungoides and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. HL and NHL are increasing substantially in Japan but not in the US, suggesting that environmental exposures, such as Westernization of the life style may be causing this increase. Differences in the incidence and trends for specific subtypes also showed a marked contrast across subtypes, which, in turn, may provide significant new insights into disease aetiology in the future.","['Chihara, Dai', 'Ito, Hidemi', 'Matsuda, Tomohiro', 'Shibata, Akiko', 'Katsumi, Akira', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Tomotaka, Sobue', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Matsuo, Keitaro']","['Chihara D', 'Ito H', 'Matsuda T', 'Shibata A', 'Katsumi A', 'Nakamura S', 'Tomotaka S', 'Morton LM', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Matsuo K']","['Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Centre Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131118,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3907701,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12659 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Feb;164(4):536-45. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12659.

The sensitivity of normal B cells to BAFF and APRIL can be modulated by signals regulated by their receptors. This modulation, however, has not been extensively investigated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells. We evaluated the expression, regulation and signalling of BAFF and APRIL receptors in normal and in CLL cells upon stimulation through CD40+IL4R and BCR. We further analysed the prognostic value of BAFF and APRIL receptors expression in patients with CLL. BCMA expression was significantly higher on CLL cells than on normal B cells. BCR and CD40+IL4R stimulation promoted an increase in TACI and BCMA expression, cell viability and activation in normal B cells. A similar effect was observed in CLL cells after CD40+IL4R but not BCR stimulation. BCMA expression correlated with unmutated IGHV genes, poor-risk cytogenetics, and short progression-free survival. These findings further characterize the link between CD40+IL4R regulatory signals, BAFF, APRIL and their receptors and the survival of leukaemic cells and clinical features of CLL.","['Ferrer, Gerardo', 'Bosch, Rosa', 'Hodgson, Kate', 'Tejero, Rut', 'Roue, Gael', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Moreno, Carol']","['Ferrer G', 'Bosch R', 'Hodgson K', 'Tejero R', 'Roue G', 'Colomer D', 'Montserrat E', 'Moreno C']","[""Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131118,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (IL4R protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TNFRSF13C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['B-Cell Activating Factor/*immunology', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*immunology']",,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12645 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Feb;164(4):570-8. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12645.

We compare two models that describe the treatment of CML, a multi-scale model (Model 1) and a simple cell competition model (Model 2). Both models describe the competition of leukemic and normal cells, however Model 1 also describes the dynamics of BCR-ABL, the oncogene targeted by imatinib, at the sub-cellular level. Using clinical data, we analyze the differences in estimated parameters between the models and the capacity for each model to predict drug resistance. We found that while both models fit the data well, Model 1 is more biologically relevant. The estimated parameter ranges for Model 2 are unrealistic, whereas the parameter ranges for Model 1 are close to values found in literature. We also found that Model 1 predicts long-term drug resistance from patient data, which is exhibited by both an increase in the proportion of leukemic cells as well as an increase in BCR-ABL/ABL Model 2, however, is not able to predict resistance and accurately model the clinical data. These results suggest that including sub-cellular mechanisms in a mathematical model of CML can increase the accuracy of parameter estimation and may help to predict long-term drug resistance.","['Everett, R A', 'Zhao, Y', 'Flores, K B', 'Kuang, Yang']","['Everett RA', 'Zhao Y', 'Flores KB', 'Kuang Y']","['School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States. rarodger@asu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Math Biosci Eng,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*physiopathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/07/02 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3934/mbe.2013.10.1501 [doi]'],ppublish,Math Biosci Eng. 2013 Oct-Dec;10(5-6):1501-18. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2013.10.1501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined variations in place of death by disease sub-type and time from diagnosis to death, to identify groups of 'at-risk' patients. METHODS: The study is based in the United Kingdom within the infrastructure of the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN), a large on-going population-based cohort including all patients newly diagnosed with haematological malignancies in the north of England. Diagnostic, demographic, prognostic, treatment and outcome data are collected for each patient and individuals are 'flagged' for death. This study includes all adults (>/=18 years) diagnosed 1st September 2004 to 31st August 2010 (n = 10,325), focussing on those who died on/before 31st August 2012 (n = 4829). RESULTS: Most deaths occurred in hospital (65.9%), followed by home (15.6%), nursing home (11%) and hospice (7.5%) and there was little variation by diagnostic sub-type overall. Differences in place of death were, however, observed by time from diagnosis to death, and this was closely related to sub-type; 87.7% of deaths within a month of diagnosis happened in hospital and these largely occurred in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and myeloma. Patients surviving longer, and particularly beyond 1 year, were less likely to die in hospital and this corresponded with an increase in the proportion of home deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Time from diagnosis to death was clearly a major determinant of place of death and many patients that died within three months of diagnosis did so in hospital. This was closely related to disease sub-type, with early deaths occurring most notable in the more aggressive diseases. This is likely to be due to a combination of factors including acute presentation, rapid disease progression without transition to a palliative approach to care and complications of treatment. Nonetheless, hospital deaths also occurred frequently in indolent diseases, suggesting that other factors were likely to contribute to the large proportion of hospital deaths overall. More evidence is needed to fully understand these complex cancers.","['Howell, Debra A', 'Wang, Han-I', 'Smith, Alexandra G', 'Howard, Martin R', 'Patmore, Russell D', 'Roman, Eve']","['Howell DA', 'Wang HI', 'Smith AG', 'Howard MR', 'Patmore RD', 'Roman E']","['Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK. debra.howell@york.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131119,England,BMC Palliat Care,BMC palliative care,101088685,,,,PMC4175093,2013/11/20 06:00,2013/11/20 06:01,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:01 [medline]']","['1472-684X-12-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-684X-12-42 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Palliat Care. 2013 Nov 19;12(1):42. doi: 10.1186/1472-684X-12-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the cellular uptake of most nucleic acid nanostructures is dependent on passive delivery or the enhanced permeability and retention effect, which may not be suitable for certain types of cancers, especially for treatment in vivo. To meet this need, we have constructed a multifunctional aptamer-based DNA nanoassembly (AptNA) for targeted cancer therapy. In particular, we first designed various Y-shaped functional DNA domains through predesigned base pair hybridization, including targeting aptamers, intercalated anticancer drugs, and therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides. Then these functional DNA domains were linked to an X-shaped DNA core connector, termed a building unit, through the complementary sequences in the arms of functional domains and connector. Finally, hundreds (~100-200) of these basic building units with 5'-modification of acrydite groups were further photo-cross-linked into a multifunctional and programmable aptamer-based nanoassembly structure able to take advantage of facile modular design and assembly, high programmability, excellent biostability and biocompatibility, as well as selective recognition and transportation. With these properties, AptNAs were demonstrated to have specific cytotoxic effect against leukemia cells. Moreover, the incorporation of therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides resulted in the inhibition of P-gp expression (a drug efflux pump to increase excretion of anticancer drugs) as well as a decrease in drug resistance. Therefore, these multifunctional and programmable aptamer-based DNA nanoassemblies show promise as candidates for targeted drug delivery and cancer therapy.","['Wu, Cuichen', 'Han, Da', 'Chen, Tao', 'Peng, Lu', 'Zhu, Guizhi', 'You, Mingxu', 'Qiu, Liping', 'Sefah, Kwame', 'Zhang, Xiaobing', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Wu C', 'Han D', 'Chen T', 'Peng L', 'Zhu G', 'You M', 'Qiu L', 'Sefah K', 'Zhang X', 'Tan W']","['Department of Chemistry and Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, Center for Research at Bio/Nano Interface, Shands Cancer Center, UF Genetics Institute and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida , Gainesville, Florida 32611-7200, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Aptamers, Nucleotide', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', '*Nanotechnology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",PMC3891927,2013/11/20 06:00,2014/07/24 06:00,['2013/11/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja4094617 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2013 Dec 11;135(49):18644-50. doi: 10.1021/ja4094617.

We have proposed that Fhit is a genome 'caretaker' whose loss initiates genome instability in preneoplastic lesions. We have characterized allele copy number alterations and expression changes observed in Fhit-deficient cells in conjunction with alterations in cellular proliferation and exome mutations, using cells from mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), mouse kidney, early and late after establishment in culture, and in response to carcinogen treatment. Fhit (-/-) MEFs escape senescence to become immortal more rapidly than Fhit (+/+) MEFs; -/- MEFs and kidney cultures show allele losses and gains, while +/+ derived cells show few genomic alterations. Striking alterations in expression of p53, p21, Mcl1 and active caspase 3 occurred in mouse kidney -/- cells during progressive tissue culture passage. To define genomic changes associated with preneoplastic changes in vivo, exome DNAs were sequenced for +/+ and -/- liver tissue after treatment of mice with the carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and for +/+ and -/- kidney cells treated in vitro with this carcinogen. The -/- exome DNAs, in comparison with +/+ DNA, showed small insertions, deletions and point mutations in more genes, some likely related to preneoplastic changes. Thus, Fhit loss provides a 'mutator' phenotype, a cellular environment in which mild genome instability permits clonal expansion, through proliferative advantage and escape from apoptosis, in response to pressures to survive.","['Miuma, Satoshi', 'Saldivar, Joshua C', 'Karras, Jenna R', 'Waters, Catherine E', 'Paisie, Carolyn A', 'Wang, Yao', 'Jin, Victor', 'Sun, Jin', 'Druck, Teresa', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Huebner, Kay']","['Miuma S', 'Saldivar JC', 'Karras JR', 'Waters CE', 'Paisie CA', 'Wang Y', 'Jin V', 'Sun J', 'Druck T', 'Zhang J', 'Huebner K']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131114,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Genomic Instability/genetics/*physiology', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3828255,2013/11/19 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0080730 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-27454 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 14;8(11):e80730. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080730. eCollection 2013.,,,,,"['CA115965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA120516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA132453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31CA157150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM068412/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA157150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM068412/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive leukemias, activation of PI3K by dysregulated BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (TK) contributes to the pathogenesis and development of resistance to ABL-TK inhibitors (TKI). The PI3K pathway thus is an attractive therapeutic target in BCR-ABL positive leukemias, but its role in BCR-ABL negative ALL is conjectural. Moreover, the functional contribution of individual components of the PI3K pathway in ALL has not been established. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared the activity of the ATP-competitive pan-PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120, the allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001, the ATP-competitive dual PI3K/mTORC1/C2 inhibitors NVP-BEZ235 and NVP-BGT226 and the combined mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitors Torin 1, PP242 and KU-0063794 using long-term cultures of ALL cells (ALL-LTC) from patients with B-precursor ALL that expressed the BCR-ABL or TEL-ABL oncoproteins or were BCR-ABL negative. RESULTS: Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors profoundly inhibited growth and survival of ALL cells irrespective of their genetic subtype and their responsiveness to ABL-TKI. Combined suppression of PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2 displayed greater antileukemic activity than selective inhibitors of PI3K, mTORC1 or mTORC1 and mTORC2. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway is a promising therapeutic approach in patients with ALL. Greater antileukemic activity of dual PI3K/mTORC1/C2 inhibitors appears to be due to the redundant function of PI3K and mTOR. Clinical trials examining dual PI3K/mTORC1/C2 inhibitors in patients with B-precursor ALL are warranted, and should not be restricted to particular genetic subtypes.","['Badura, Susanne', 'Tesanovic, Tamara', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Wystub, Sylvia', 'Nijmeijer, Bart A', 'Liebermann, Marcus', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Badura S', 'Tesanovic T', 'Pfeifer H', 'Wystub S', 'Nijmeijer BA', 'Liebermann M', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Ruthardt M', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131114,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0', '(1-(4-(4-propionylpiperazin-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-9-(quinolin-3-yl)ben', 'zo(h)(1,6)naphthyridin-2(1H)-one)', '0', '(8-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-(4-piperazin-1-yl-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-', '1,3-dihydroimidazo(4,5-c)quinolin-2-one)', '0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NVP-BKM120)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '81HJG228AB (Ku 0063794)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Everolimus', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Multiprotein Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Naphthyridines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3828226,2013/11/19 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0080070 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-26848 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 14;8(11):e80070. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080070. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to explore the anticancer activities of RBL using human leukemic T-cell lines, Molt-4, Jurkat and HuT-78. RBL exhibited significant binding (>90%) to the cell membrane that was effectively inhibited by complex glycoproteins such as mucin (97% inhibition) and asialofetuin (94% inhibition) but not simple sugars such as N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, glucose and sucrose. RBL induced a dose and time dependent inhibition of proliferation and induced cytotoxicity in the cell lines. The percentage of apoptotic cells, as determined by hypodiploidy, was 33% and 42% in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells, respectively, compared to 3.11% and 2.92% in controls. This effect was associated with a concomitant decrease in the G0/G1 population. Though initiator caspase-8 and -9 were activated upon exposure to RBL, inhibition of caspase-8 but not caspase-9 rescued cells from RBL-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that RBL induced cleavage of Bid, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3. The expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X was down regulated without altering the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins--Bad and Bax. In contrast to leukemic cells, RBL did not induce apoptosis in normal PBMC, isolated CD3+ve cells and undifferentiated CD34+ve hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The findings highlight the differential effects of RBL on transformed and normal hematopoietic cells and suggest that RBL may be explored for therapeutic applications in leukemia.","['Pujari, Radha', 'Eligar, Sachin M', 'Kumar, Natesh', 'Barkeer, Srikanth', 'Reddy, Vishwanath', 'Swamy, Bale M', 'Inamdar, Shashikala R', 'Shastry, Padma']","['Pujari R', 'Eligar SM', 'Kumar N', 'Barkeer S', 'Reddy V', 'Swamy BM', 'Inamdar SR', 'Shastry P']","['National Centre for Cell Science, Pune University Campus, Pune, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131114,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rhizoctonia/*chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism']",PMC3828372,2013/11/19 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0079311 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-12175 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 14;8(11):e79311. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0079311. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, focusing only on transcription is not sufficient for mechanism research. Most genes, especially in eukaryotes, are alternatively spliced to different isoforms. Some of these isoforms increase the biodiversity of proteins. From this viewpoint, transcription and splicing are two of important mechanisms to modulate expression levels of isoforms. To integrate these two kinds of regulation, we built a linear regression model to select a subset of transcription factors and splicing factors for each co-expressed isoforms using least-angle regression approach. Then, we applied this method to investigate the mechanism of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a precursor lesion of acute myeloid leukemia. Results suggested that expression levels of most isoforms were regulated by a set of selected regulatory factors. Some of the detected factors, such as EGR1 and STAT family, are highly correlated with progression of MDS. We discovered that the splicing factor SRSF11 experienced alternative splicing switch, and in turn induced different amino acid sequences between MDS and controls. This splicing switch causes two different splicing mechanisms. Polymerase Chain Reaction experiments also confirmed that one of its isoforms was over-expressed in MDS. We analyzed the regulatory networks constructed from the co-expressed isoforms and their regulatory factors in MDS. Many of these networks were enriched in the herpes simplex infection pathway which involves many splicing factors, and pathways in cancers and acute or chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Wang, Hongyan', 'Wen, Jianguo', 'Chang, Chung-Che', 'Zhou, Xiaobo']","['Wang H', 'Wen J', 'Chang CC', 'Zhou X']","['Center for Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Division of Radiologic Sciences, Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131114,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism', '*RNA Splicing', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3828332,2013/11/19 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0079118 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-22199 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 14;8(11):e79118. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0079118. eCollection 2013.,,,,,"['R01 LM010185/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA166886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01LM010185-04/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperative antileukemic activities of panobinostat and cytarabine or daunorubicin (DNR) in AML cell lines and diagnostic blast samples in vitro and in vivo. Panobinostat suppressed expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further, panobinostat significantly increased cytarabine- or DNR-induced DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis, and abrogated S and/or G2/M cell cycle checkpoints. Analogous results were obtained by shRNA knockdown of BRCA1, CHK1, or RAD51. Cotreatment of NOD-SCID-IL2Rgamma(null) mice bearing AML xenografts with panobinostat and cytarabine significantly increased survival compared to either cytarabine or panobinostat treatment alone. Additional studies revealed that panobinostat suppressed the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 through downregulation of E2F1 transcription factor.

LSC and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) share many characteristics and co-exist in the bone marrow of AML patients. For the development of successful LSC-targeted therapy, enabling eradication of LSC while sparing HSC, the identification of differences between LSC and HSC residing within the AML bone marrow is crucial. For identification of these LSC targets, as well as for AML LSC characterization, discrimination between LSC and HSC within the AML bone marrow is imperative. Here we show that normal CD34+CD38- HSC present in AML bone marrow, identified by their lack of aberrant immunophenotypic and molecular marker expression and low scatter properties, are a distinct sub-population of cells with high ALDH activity (ALDH(bright)). The ALDH(bright) compartment contains, besides normal HSC, more differentiated, normal CD34+CD38+ progenitors. Furthermore, we show that in CD34-negative AML, containing solely normal CD34+ cells, LSC are CD34- and ALDH(low). In CD34-positive AML, LSC are also ALDH(low) but can be either CD34+ or CD34-. In conclusion, although malignant AML blasts have varying ALDH activity, a common feature of all AML cases is that LSC have lower ALDH activity than the CD34+CD38- HSC that co-exist with these LSC in the AML bone marrow. Our findings form the basis for combined functionally and immunophenotypically based identification and purification of LSC and HSC within the AML bone marrow, aiming at development of highly specific anti-LSC therapy.","['Schuurhuis, Gerrit J', 'Meel, Michael H', 'Wouters, Floris', 'Min, Lisa A', 'Terwijn, Monique', 'de Jonge, Nick A', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Snel, Alexander N', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Smit, Linda']","['Schuurhuis GJ', 'Meel MH', 'Wouters F', 'Min LA', 'Terwijn M', 'de Jonge NA', 'Kelder A', 'Snel AN', 'Zweegman S', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Smit L']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131111,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology']",PMC3823975,2013/11/19 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2012/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0078897 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-20702 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 11;8(11):e78897. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078897. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lifetime dose was estimated for controls interviewed in person (N = 2811, 37.5% women) of the population-based representative Northern Germany Leukemia and Lymphoma Study. Data were assessed in standardized computer-assisted personal interviews. The calculation of doses is based on a comprehensive quantification model including calendar year, sex, kind of examination, and technical development. In multivariate regression models the annual red bone marrow dose was analyzed depending on age, sex and calendar year to consider simultaneously temporal changes in radiologic practice and individual risk factors. While the number of examinations continuously rises over time, the dose shows two peaks around 1950 and after 1980. Men are exposed to higher doses than woman. Until 1970 traditional examinations like conventional and mass screening examinations caused the main dose. They were then replaced by technically advanced examinations mainly computed tomography and cardiac catheter.

In this study, we characterized mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow (BM) of 45 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-MSCs) at diagnosis (day+0) and during chemotherapy treatment (days: +15; +33; +78), the time points being chosen according to the schedule of BM aspirates required by the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 treatment protocol. Morphology, proliferative capacity, immunophenotype, differentiation potential, immunomodulatory properties and ability to support long-term hematopoiesis of ALL-MSCs were analysed and compared with those from 41 healthy donors (HD-MSCs). ALL-MSCs were also genetically characterized through array-CGH, conventional karyotyping and FISH analysis. Moreover, we compared ALL-MSCs generated at day+0 with those isolated during chemotherapy. Morphology, immunophenotype, differentiation potential and in vitro life-span did not differ between ALL-MSCs and HD-MSCs. ALL-MSCs showed significantly lower proliferative capacity (p<0.001) and ability to support in vitro hematopoiesis (p = 0.04) as compared with HD-MSCs, while they had similar capacity to inhibit in vitro mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation (p = N.S.). ALL-MSCs showed neither the typical translocations carried by the leukemic clone (when present), nor other genetic abnormalities acquired during ex vivo culture. Our findings indicate that ALL-MSCs display reduced ability to proliferate and to support long-term hematopoiesis in vitro. ALL-MSCs isolated at diagnosis do not differ from those obtained during treatment.","['Conforti, Antonella', 'Biagini, Simone', 'Del Bufalo, Francesca', 'Sirleto, Pietro', 'Angioni, Adriano', 'Starc, Nadia', 'Li Pira, Giuseppina', 'Moretta, Francesca', 'Proia, Alessandra', 'Contoli, Benedetta', 'Genovese, Silvia', 'Ciardi, Claudia', 'Avanzini, Maria Antonietta', 'Rosti, Vittorio', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Bernardo, Maria Ester']","['Conforti A', 'Biagini S', 'Del Bufalo F', 'Sirleto P', 'Angioni A', 'Starc N', 'Li Pira G', 'Moretta F', 'Proia A', 'Contoli B', 'Genovese S', 'Ciardi C', 'Avanzini MA', 'Rosti V', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Locatelli F', 'Bernardo ME']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131107,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors']",PMC3820675,2013/11/19 06:00,2014/07/23 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0076989 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-29436 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Nov 7;8(11):e76989. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0076989. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The male specific lethal (MSL) HAT complex plays a key role in dosage compensation in Drosophila and is responsible for histone H4K16ac in vivo. We and others previously described a second hMOF-containing HAT complex, the non-specific lethal (NSL) HAT complex. The NSL complex has a broader substrate specificity, can acetylate H4 on K16, K5, and K8. The WD (tryptophan-aspartate) repeat domain 5 (WDR5) and host cell factor 1 (HCF1) are shared among members of the MLL/SET (mixed-lineage leukemia/set-domain containing) family of histone H3K4 methyltransferase complexes. The presence of these shared subunits raises the possibility that there are functional links between these complexes and the histone modifications they catalyze; however, the degree to which NSL and MLL/SET influence one another's activities remains unclear. Here, we present evidence from biochemical assays and knockdown/overexpression approaches arguing that the NSL HAT promotes histone H3K4me2 by MLL/SET complexes by an acetylation-dependent mechanism. In genomic experiments, we identified a set of genes including ANKRD2, that are affected by knockdown of both NSL and MLL/SET subunits, suggested they are co-regulated by NSL and MLL/SET complexes. In ChIP assays, we observe that depletion of the NSL subunits hMOF or NSL1 resulted in a significant reduction of both H4K16ac and H3K4me2 in the vicinity of the ANKRD2 transcriptional start site proximal region. However, depletion of RbBP5 (a core component of MLL/SET complexes) only reduced H3K4me2 marks, but not H4K16ac in the same region of ANKRD2, consistent with the idea that NSL acts upstream of MLL/SET to regulate H3K4me2 at certain promoters, suggesting coordination between NSL and MLL/SET complexes is involved in transcriptional regulation of certain genes. Taken together, our results suggest a crosstalk between the NSL and MLL/SET complexes in cells.","['Zhao, Xiaoming', 'Su, Jiaming', 'Wang, Fei', 'Liu, Da', 'Ding, Jian', 'Yang, Yang', 'Conaway, Joan W', 'Conaway, Ronald C', 'Cao, Lingling', 'Wu, Donglu', 'Wu, Min', 'Cai, Yong', 'Jin, Jingji']","['Zhao X', 'Su J', 'Wang F', 'Liu D', 'Ding J', 'Yang Y', 'Conaway JW', 'Conaway RC', 'Cao L', 'Wu D', 'Wu M', 'Cai Y', 'Jin J']","['School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131114,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (ANKRD2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT8 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (histone acetyltransferase type B complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",PMC3828133,2013/11/19 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1003940 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-13-01031 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2013 Nov;9(11):e1003940. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003940.

Like other ILCs, iNKT cells constitutively express ID proteins, which antagonize the E protein transcription factors that are essential for adaptive lymphocyte development. However, unlike ILCs, ID2 is not essential for thymic iNKT cell development. In this study, we demonstrated that ID2 and ID3 redundantly promoted iNKT cell lineage specification involving the induction of the signature transcription factor PLZF and that ID3 was critical for development of TBET-dependent NKT1 cells. In contrast, both ID2 and ID3 limited iNKT cell numbers by enforcing the postselection checkpoint in conventional thymocytes. Therefore, iNKT cells show both adaptive and innate-like requirements for ID proteins at distinct checkpoints during iNKT cell development.","['Verykokakis, Mihalis', 'Krishnamoorthy, Veena', 'Iavarone, Antonio', 'Lasorella, Anna', 'Sigvardsson, Mikael', 'Kee, Barbara L']","['Verykokakis M', 'Krishnamoorthy V', 'Iavarone A', 'Lasorella A', 'Sigvardsson M', 'Kee BL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131115,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Idb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '135845-89-5 (Idb3 protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Clonal Selection, Antigen-Mediated', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/deficiency/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopoiesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Radiation Chimera', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/growth & development']",PMC3864619,2013/11/19 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1301521 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1301521 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Dec 15;191(12):5973-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1301521.

Thrombomodulin is a membrane glycoprotein in the vascular endothelium. Its plasma level depends on the integrity of the endothelium. Soluble thrombomodulin is derived from injured endothelial cells or proteolytically cleaved from thrombomodulin by proteases. Von Willebrand factor is a blood glycoprotein involved in homeostasis. Its plasma level increases in neoplastic diseases and arises from adverse changes in the endothelium. Severe endothelial dysfunction is present during the acute phase of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and soluble thrombomodulin have been used as indexes of endothelial dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess serum soluble thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor levels in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during acute phase of the disease to assess their potential prognostic value. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia included 26 males and 14 females with their ages ranged from 2 to 10 years and 20 healthy children of matched age and sex were included in this study. We analyzed serum soluble thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, there was a significant increase in soluble thrombomodulin, and von Willebrand factor levels during the acute phase of the disease. Children with an unfavorable outcome had higher levels of thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor levels. CONCLUSIONS: Serum thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor levels as a parameter of endothelial dysfunction during the acute phase of acute lymphoblastic leukemia might represent an additional prognostic marker in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Hagag, Adel A E', 'Abdel-Lateef, Amal E', 'Aly, Rabab']","['Hagag AA', 'Abdel-Lateef AE', 'Aly R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tanta University Hospital, Tanta, Egypt adelhagag20@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Tanta University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131115,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (THBD protein, human)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Egypt', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/mortality/physiopathology/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombomodulin/*blood', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'von Willebrand Factor/*analysis']",,2013/11/19 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2013/11/19 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155213508439 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155213508439 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2014 Oct;20(5):356-61. doi: 10.1177/1078155213508439.
